# ADS Harvard Data

## Findings

+ Some disciplines seem to be more read than others… Especially *Astrophysics* and *Computer Vision* --> NASA ADS is probably used by mostly astrophysicists. (Computer Vision maybe because of image processing tasks)
+ From now we are concentrating on **Astrophysics**. The goal is to create visuaizations that can be presented to the Harvards/ADS people… Visulization of the six subdisciplines

## Clustering

+ Concetrate on senseful clustering. In general reader (click) numbers seam to be useful information as the clustering of the subdisciplines works pretty well
+ 6 Disciplines -> 6 Clusters: k-means clustering?
+ Hierarchical Clustering + Elbow leads to many small clusters (~15)
+ Hierarchical Clustering + p-value threashold works great with Top 100, but struggles with 200+

## Tasks

+ Test different clustering algorithms with different document numbers (Top 100/200/300)
	+ k-means with 4,5,6 clusters
	+ hclust with elbow
	+ hclust with p-value of 0.95
+ Evaluate different linking methods (average, ward.D, ward.D2, ...)
+ Calculate Purity
+ Evaluate number of clusters and the respective sizes
