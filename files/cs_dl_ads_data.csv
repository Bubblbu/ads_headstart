0,"Devising a weight assignment policy for assigning credits to multiple authors of a manuscript is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a scheme for assigning credits to multiple authors that we call a polynomial weight assignment scheme. We compare our scheme with other schemes proposed in the literature.","Abbas, Ash Mohammad",ArXiv e-prints,,0,Polynomial Weights or Generalized Geometric Weights: Yet Another Scheme for Assigning Credits to Multiple Authors,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2848,2011
1,"The modified SNIP indicator of Elsevier, as recently explained by Waltman et al. (2013) in this journal, solves some of the problems which Leydesdorff & Opthof (2010 and 2011) indicated in relation to the original SNIP indicator (Moed, 2010 and 2011). The use of an arithmetic average, however, remains unfortunate in the case of scientometric distributions because these can be extremely skewed (Seglen, 1992 and 1997). The new indicator cannot (or hardly) be reproduced independently when used for evaluation purposes, and remains in this sense opaque from the perspective of evaluated units and scholars.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X0ec9e2786;X1bed05f5d;X24dcbab78;X2f018c304;X3218ad700;X33ce98bfe;X45457dd0b;X47c7fbcf8;X547b44379;X6bfe27a86;X6d276eb70;X6ea8d048f;X7fa4a5643;X85b1bfed6;X868e11c94;X9156758d1;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa2f1b1547;Xbe83d726d;Xcf809ed21;Xe1d3d9d13;Xe3ff27609;Xe950918c9;Xf73fdf7f5;Xfbf8513b2,25,The revised SNIP indicator of Elsevier's Scopus,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3771,2013
2,"Scientific research is a major driving force in a knowledge based economy. Income, health and wellbeing depend on scientific progress. The better we understand the inner workings of the scientific enterprise, the better we can prompt, manage, steer, and utilize scientific progress. Diverse indicators and approaches exist to evaluate and monitor research activities, from calculating the reputation of a researcher, institution, or country to analyzing and visualizing global brain circulation. However, there are very few predictive models of science that are used by key decision makers in academia, industry, or government interested to improve the quality and impact of scholarly efforts. We present a novel 'bibliographic bibliometric' analysis which we apply to a large collection of books relevant for the modelling of science. We explain the data collection together with the results of the data analyses and visualizations. In the final section we discuss how the analysis of books that describe different modelling approaches can inform the design of new models of science.","Ginda, Michael;Scharnhorst, Andrea;Borner, Katy",ArXiv e-prints,46c513c7fd;54e0416d50;X000789272;X00b35837c;X01ebd4381;X023c75145;X02b76b66b;X036b01730;X048640e99;X05a8a5d10;X0620cf123;X06db92e89;X089bee326;X097ed4ae7;X09a018eb4;X0a31fdf09;X0ad35f7c7;X0b163b992;X0b559beb5;X0bb577a13;X0db9965e7;X0efb78f25;X0fe63bf78;X0fedd6124;X108351794;X1205c64ff;X137b12114;X13874bb10;X14d0e1f36;X15b817b30;X1651ab86f;X169692bf4;X1732dd666;X174e7000e;X174fb7d90;X179ea0daf;X188839e99;X18fa69247;X19c1a972c;X1a4a4f09e;X1b44e6250;X1ca5a6eac;X1cf52f2dd;X1e20c58ee;X200c57085;X204aa66dc;X213827176;X2207f8f24;X224bac08e;X23d3c7580;X23ef19f99;X24757d814;X247f9d028;X2574e0308;X26743d03b;X26f01ceca;X27e39e207;X281f07d1d;X2846c5b73;X28708cb99;X299cf3488;X2b7342c13;X2b937396e;X2ba0c7cad;X2cb99fc09;X2cf0d2aac;X2d71c3a69;X2dcf2d835;X2f052bcd6;X2fc464f4e;X30a815c20;X30cd2689b;X361bb6670;X371fd3695;X3770df24f;X398655304;X39d0ae7e4;X3a66ca807;X3b43409bf;X3ce9a908e;X3d3e4d160;X3d44a7f04;X3d7ec5495;X3d843a54e;X3db0f582e;X3e1906eed;X3ef0b716b;X3f2d86862;X403513c65;X4057ebcdb;X411cef32b;X41b9064b8;X4311a6df8;X43165819f;X45e28903e;X47d7ea946;X490a23e85;X490d57efe;X4b906d55f;X4b96c7cb5;X4c84feab6;X4dbc40785;X4e3fa00bc;X4e7d18338;X4eb3d2e80;X4fde555ef;X500c6a1aa;X5054c41e5;X50b16d1c8;X50e2e4ca1;X514f133d7;X51d210228;X521c2e83a;X540fb41b0;X5445e37f1;X54ed90da1;X571bd8c26;X577d93a32;X58572e5b0;X585fd6173;X5886ebc95;X5976a18ec;X59c362c1f;X5a947e268;X5ae5941ea;X5bb4bac95;X5c43cc83e;X5d1c9f8ea;X5d1dfcbb1;X5e03629fd;X5ee74a8c5;X5ef21b411;X5f3da438b;X60f98518b;X623f4239b;X62acc3a3d;X630586baf;X632cf746f;X656033cc9;X65b7abec0;X65d6be3c3;X65d9f8fa0;X6811985b3;X689577a0b;X69df18bd7;X6b06c3ac7;X6cc9aec21;X6d818bbdb;X6e4f7fa88;X6f8a207d9;X705253af0;X70b2c6e4a;X7341881fb;X73eb2b969;X741325e49;X74e804183;X7617f9c08;X78b69fdbc;X793d5102e;X799da32de;X79b0450d9;X79b11e4d4;X7b9a520a7;X7ba04b176;X7c0caa005;X7c281a185;X7d6c497b1;X7f4aef04f;X82d1a498b;X82d1b1f42;X82e1a0516;X85bcd142e;X863ccae94;X875783253;X8822d8140;X8891be06d;X897be2f5b;X8aca6970d;X8c85cd23f;X8c8aeaacd;X8d9251e58;X8dcba5a59;X8eacea9c2;X909dd642f;X91453db42;X9268bf615;X92d78b4c4;X933c74132;X93b310166;X9464d3adf;X947176991;X9501b840d;X97106bd14;X9796a47c6;X97acd9d70;X98397c13d;X988eb1e31;X994d0d770;X9a098b79c;X9c4449f74;X9c46fdb05;X9cd27b529;X9dffedcce;X9e6d6ef97;X9f87cd28c;X9f92ac4c8;X9ff0a4a55;Xa1f09a769;Xa2688f5e4;Xa2c3cb6c4;Xa2fd2936f;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa41b998da;Xa659a8bc4;Xa726deb57;Xa7dc8af1d;Xa82d2fd79;Xa886620bb;Xa91731636;Xa962a3773;Xa9c5022d7;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xabe51ba06;Xac5fb1f4d;Xacdafa659;Xae472c012;Xaf854c44b;Xb02f64c6e;Xb19a50b85;Xb207c6ed4;Xb40ae6be3;Xb41f7434c;Xb454fe332;Xb4982795d;Xb56db48f0;Xb5d8a875e;Xb71315dd5;Xb7b920db6;Xb7d3f2477;Xb823aed8b;Xb86bdf63c;Xb8ac211d3;Xb8da05ad9;Xb9b9b59f6;Xbab961688;Xbb6d9bb83;Xbb78aca67;Xbd629a685;Xbe4e39122;Xc128950b9;Xc18690c03;Xc24597d1e;Xc41d709a4;Xc4573721b;Xc48b05d25;Xc67e4cccc;Xc6af93996;Xc6b9c9114;Xc81ed2fc3;Xc92812bd8;Xc984fcdda;Xca2358f3a;Xcab254363;Xcc10c9900;Xcdaa551ac;Xce945e4bb;Xd0301b5f9;Xd154bdb57;Xd1b04eed2;Xd2d5d9618;Xd31caff0b;Xd5e904c02;Xd7067de4a;Xd76d5d28e;Xd78cd0a86;Xd8cbe1063;Xd8f37132b;Xd94e88085;Xd972632d3;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdb31c9c3d;Xdb802f809;Xdc4dca7f9;Xdcd46b8ea;Xdd0653880;Xdd71f026b;Xdde404e44;Xded9fe4b4;Xdf226d1eb;Xe0823bc4b;Xe0b81bc38;Xe20a4eac8;Xe3003f4bc;Xe424afdea;Xe5b27b210;Xe5d9d4338;Xe69a80d7e;Xe70852b82;Xe8960466b;Xe95bfeda6;Xe9db5e1e2;Xeb4e74887;Xeb85f2dc7;Xebae586e4;Xecc727c85;Xee441c320;Xeea051f3b;Xf06279c7d;Xf388a0d61;Xf4799c5a3;Xf5a83abcf;Xf7e4a8ca5;Xf84aeb79e;Xf8a676026;Xf9493ed4d;Xfacd06a06;Xfcb0c1ebd;Xff4189165;Xff8d167ec,319,Modelling the Structure and Dynamics of Science Using Books,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03287,2015
3,"This work-in-progress paper introduces an interface for the interactive visual exploration of the context of queries using the ArticleFirst database, a product of OCLC. We describe a workflow which allows the user to browse live entities associated with 65 million articles. In the on-line interface, each query leads to a specific network representation of the most prevailing entities: topics (words), authors, journals and Dewey decimal classes linked to the set of terms in the query. This network represents the context of a query. Each of the network nodes is clickable: by clicking through, a user traverses a large space of articles along dimensions of authors, journals, Dewey classes and words simultaneously. We present different use cases of such an interface. This paper provides a link between the quest for maps of science and on-going debates in HCI about the use of interactive information visualisation to empower users in their search.","Koopman, Rob;Wang, Shenghui;Scharnhorst, Andrea;Englebienne, Gwenn",ArXiv e-prints,550cf98b5e;X01a466841;X03845e180;X048cba58f;X09626d846;X0a31fdf09;X0da4af694;X0e4378faf;X10b0b1669;X11ac2642d;X1297191d5;X131d6b5fa;X13db5783b;X169692bf4;X1e1956c79;X1efb9dc32;X2156f609a;X21a3854db;X21e720a82;X25bd6525e;X2d7333ef5;X31f8155bd;X361dedee0;X375fdb217;X398043d97;X39d0ae7e4;X3ae117844;X3c015c7fb;X3c38d889c;X3e82245a3;X3ed3ce919;X40a132d7f;X453a162ba;X45e266160;X4b6cb1b84;X4ba952907;X4e1809577;X52d31dd29;X58572e5b0;X58aec828c;X5b5e1389a;X5c557837a;X5c9e2e737;X5ce168196;X5d71549fa;X5df17651d;X5f3da438b;X6235fae48;X66a72d77a;X694105efc;X6f34653bc;X6f7f69e05;X750765624;X75baaf6ac;X78ccf6572;X7b750ec65;X7bd6dcf35;X819758e0b;X854b10532;X868f2f49b;X87107a073;X875783253;X886791a89;X8bdbd4c0f;X8cc6a0a82;X93213e8a5;X938b29472;X96303892d;X9c611c80f;X9d934b999;X9f6cb8038;Xa0a6ea9a9;Xa0f721c4b;Xa30230692;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa41b998da;Xa82d2fd79;Xa8a457410;Xb10d09250;Xb3722064a;Xb38bc18f3;Xb4213bf93;Xb5edf242b;Xb893c786c;Xbbe072bba;Xbd1adcf05;Xbd5f150ed;Xbd629a685;Xbdabe5336;Xbe466a79c;Xbfaaef258;Xc0ae453c0;Xc6b9c9114;Xcaaf21298;Xcb798ab25;Xcfd3d997b;Xd09497c15;Xd3f86c2bb;Xd6f93799d;Xd9c69cbc0;Xde1606e6b;Xe11480003;Xe19540343;Xe221007e7;Xe299818bd;Xe424afdea;Xe6689f716;Xe7b94784a;Xeb85f2dc7;Xebd6e13f0;Xef358bcbe;Xefaff09cc;Xf06279c7d;Xf2517d8a2;Xf7caccc5a;Xfba3d1cbb;Xffa157c4c;Xffd9ea264,118,Ariadne's Thread - Interactive Navigation in a World of Networked Information,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04358,2015
4,"Four years after the last LISA meeting, the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)  finds itself in the middle of major changes to the infrastructure and contents of its database. In this paper we highlight a number of features of  great importance to librarians and discuss the additional functionality that we are currently developing.  Our citation coverage has doubled since 2010 and now consists of over 10 million citations.  We are normalizing the affiliation information in our records and we have started collecting and linking funding sources with papers in our system. At the same time, we are undergoing major technology changes in the ADS platform. We have rolled out and are now enhancing a new high-performance search  engine capable of performing full-text as well as metadata searches using an intuitive query language. We are currently able to index acknowledgments, affiliations, citations, and funding sources. While this effort is still ongoing, some of its benefits are already available through the ADS Labs user interface and API at http://adslabs.org/adsabs/.","Accomazzi, A.;Kurtz, M. J.;Henneken, E.

5,"The World Wide Web is fast becoming a source of information for a large part of the world's population. Because of its sheer size and complexity users often resort to recommendations from others to decide which sites to visit. We present a dynamical theory of recommendations which predicts site visits by users of the World Wide Web. We show that it leads to a universal power law for the number of users that visit given sites over periods of time, with an exponent related to the rate at which users discover new sites on their own. An extensive empirical study of user behavior in the Web that we conducted confirms the existence of this law of influence while yielding bounds on the rate of novelty encountered by users.","Huberman, Bernardo A.;Adamic, Lada A.",ArXiv e-prints,X27e893155;X2bd98419f;X5d1f33755;X5e68b9b4b;X6233a8754;Xc1f6bbbf5,6,Novelty and Social Search in the World Wide Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9809025,1998
6,"As a response to the trends of the increasing importance of computational approaches and the accelerating pace in science, I propose in this position paper to establish the concept of ""science bots"" that autonomously perform programmed tasks on input data they encounter and immediately publish the results. We can let such bots participate in a reputation system together with human users, meaning that bots and humans get positive or negative feedback by other participants. Positive reputation given to these bots would also shine on their owners, motivating them to contribute to this system, while negative reputation will allow us to filter out low-quality data, which is inevitable in an open and decentralized system.","Kuhn, Tobias",ArXiv e-prints,550cf99dbe;X000789272;X01ffdcacd;X02ca5f1e9;X037bff9fc;X03845e180;X04929e07f;X04db9b81f;X05a8a5d10;X05e6873ce;X0654b4ce7;X07cab5ffd;X08537be94;X097ed4ae7;X0a31fdf09;X0d2500f23;X0e4378faf;X1023e9486;X10ae3455c;X114c6a778;X1297191d5;X131d6b5fa;X13db5783b;X1ac5a16b2;X1b428b7a5;X1d59cac4d;X1d9688fc1;X1dc00ef9c;X1e6389e1f;X20659aac8;X210d4914c;X21c60383c;X21e51d306;X230e3a268;X267f33dc0;X2916cb14e;X2a9bcce75;X2b43b9966;X2d7333ef5;X2e8e15269;X2ef7fe3d7;X30e6dd0e4;X310ccc08a;X3111f3f58;X320fa5a59;X3211340c4;X321afe71a;X34266ec84;X345d2434b;X351c82692;X354db9643;X35c3868db;X35f031a9a;X361dedee0;X3731f6811;X37f7e3f2b;X390af2cc3;X3a01366b1;X3a13bda4c;X3b290a086;X3b41c8d96;X3b82c2309;X3c38d889c;X3c8f16846;X3d7a244b0;X3e82245a3;X3f9771978;X3f99ce57d;X3fc66229e;X413caa225;X445f2ea8a;X446078991;X45886f9da;X46c39dcee;X485afac26;X48683fc04;X497af27a1;X4ab040308;X4b6476189;X5054c41e5;X514f133d7;X5152d33ce;X5209d98d7;X5382337ec;X5572e1288;X55f2269dc;X56a377bb2;X56d5a6f02;X585fd6173;X589897f15;X58aec828c;X596f60ab3;X59f86e9b3;X5b8b512cf;X5c557837a;X5cacc23cf;X5cb802067;X5ce168196;X5cf5fc891;X5e4272229;X5ee57097b;X5ef21b411;X612ada3af;X61478fe3e;X616996788;X61ddb7529;X621e420bf;X62acc3a3d;X651b27f9e;X66f09efb3;X6759c8266;X67af3b894;X6861f88e7;X68db96647;X69f2c6302;X6abee4871;X6c42006d7;X6cc9aec21;X6da8343a0;X6dbce0c76;X6dfcaef66;X6f8a207d9;X6f928dcbb;X6fcec4c91;X70cacdcf2;X722cb4828;X7256fc57b;X750765624;X75319ba5d;X75baaf6ac;X7614d94f8;X7690aa546;X775e67102;X777d9b03c;X78ccf6572;X78f3f1285;X78fc3dd58;X79138d462;X79b11e4d4;X7b33eef7d;X7b8722eb1;X7be1c4aac;X7c281a185;X7c985cf58;X7d2904d8f;X7e3b37624;X7f1f75d8e;X7f4011c2c;X7f4b42be1;X7f64bd58a;X7feaa704f;X82d26ae85;X83943ea24;X84a92dce2;X86adc4f32;X8810142f4;X8833d03fa;X88ea22a1b;X88fbf066b;X8909c7bad;X8c2ee307f;X8c46bc694;X8e66da2d0;X9002849db;X91dc1240f;X94bb4c8d0;X94d96f35a;X95a7a77ff;X96303892d;X9718b8350;X989125c83;X9a44f4223;X9c4449f74;X9c46fdb05;X9c980ef41;X9ded9a323;X9e6d6ef97;X9fcf38346;Xa0c1d9ce2;Xa27cbb0cc;Xa2ba2133a;Xa2bfccfe9;Xa4661bb6e;Xa659a8bc4;Xa7a8b490e;Xa82d2fd79;Xa88a5d4db;Xa8a457410;Xa9bbfebbd;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xad069d522;Xade39d2f9;Xae274325b;Xae9523826;Xb05ccdce2;Xb078796d1;Xb0c4eb841;Xb3a7fe885;Xb3d9a6806;Xb505be2d3;Xb71074f55;Xb86bdf63c;Xbab961688;Xbd629a685;Xbd74722d2;Xbdba93d59;Xbeab6c0c4;Xc01a098b9;Xc0d2dc06d;Xc10c7c14c;Xc128950b9;Xc1e6e7503;Xc27ebd9e2;Xc337aa09c;Xc4c0ad844;Xc54e7f700;Xc6b9c9114;Xc8056e93d;Xc891787cb;Xca4e7d475;Xcab254363;Xcac29f0eb;Xcae784ec4;Xcba7025af;Xcd7a631c7;Xce9907ab9;Xcf17b9f95;Xcf921be27;Xd00ddc803;Xd11561d0d;Xd175ad60a;Xd20c02f1f;Xd2be3ae5b;Xd4e423985;Xd50e5348e;Xd5793726c;Xd796f932b;Xd804939ad;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdc4dca7f9;Xdc9e22c30;Xdd95974bb;Xde4d46552;Xdf226d1eb;Xdfc20fd96;Xdfdbb6080;Xe0e9da0c4;Xe1280817f;Xe1f010903;Xe305388bc;Xe3e18cb7e;Xe4d042885;Xe695307af;Xe6c5caa94;Xe6cb76226;Xe76cc291d;Xe78391481;Xeb85f2dc7;Xebd6e13f0;Xee95fc9c3;Xf06279c7d;Xf07e1edfb;Xf0dfe959e;Xf433b3f4e;Xf434ad2c2;Xf4799c5a3;Xf5a83abcf;Xf7626990a;Xf776f2343;Xf7caccc5a;Xf808d0164;Xf87a96f9a;Xf886532e8;Xf8b755325;Xf8e6f5481;Xf921a0212;Xfb9613015;Xfbe5464df;Xfc06cb359;Xfcb0c1ebd,280,Science Bots: a Model for the Future of Scientific Computation?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04374,2015

8,"In this work we propose a metric to assess academic productivity based on publication outputs. We are interested in knowing how well a research group in an area of knowledge is doing relatively to a pre-selected set of reference groups, where each group is composed by academics or researchers. To assess academic productivity we propose a new metric, which we call P-score. Our metric P-score assigns weights to venues using only the publication patterns of selected reference groups. This implies that P-score does not depend on citation data and thus, that it is simpler to compute particularly in contexts in which citation data is not easily available. Also, preliminary experiments suggest that P-score preserves strong correlation with citation-based metrics.","Ribas, Sabir;Ribeiro-Neto, Berthier;Silva, Edmundo de Souza e;Ueda, Alberto;Ziviani, Nivio",ArXiv e-prints,X0086c49c4;X01ffdcacd;X02ae88878;X0506e7dc7;X05a8a5d10;X0b31f8fa4;X0b559beb5;X114840220;X1474da82d;X172add237;X19338a1b4;X1b693b8a0;X209d6509b;X24475cd66;X29c5d1b2b;X2a077f892;X2a9e5e6c9;X2adb5501f;X2b1e26a26;X2b6b87357;X30cd2689b;X316958a04;X37df33ce4;X3ac097ca5;X3ffab2a81;X41c09052b;X4356bb178;X46f3f6a60;X49cea0eec;X5054f0c63;X54477d2c0;X56294722e;X56f6d6fdd;X592173549;X5e4bd34b9;X649e9bfbd;X6613c2931;X6927b0dc7;X69ce7c311;X6f8a207d9;X73cc310ec;X78dca00ea;X7b16f8158;X82690b573;X8be5e54a3;X8ec6c6a36;X961bb3d7a;X96a2cd00d;X972095368;X99b9d486e;Xa0c2bf715;Xa150953f6;Xa27d9952b;Xa4dedef32;Xa9206bcec;Xab10e81c7;Xae64c797e;Xaf36fda9e;Xaf77aaadd;Xb3e47aa3f;Xb6ac6726c;Xbed646f33;Xc1054d9f6;Xc1b9dcd94;Xc8936391a;Xc9b69de63;Xd147ef247;Xd17bfe87b;Xd4bd77a15;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdf2c9211c;Xe0c250128;Xe221007e7;Xe424afdea;Xede143ca8;Xf9e12b166;Xfc06cb359;Xff9c3bc5d;Xffdbe7e52,79,P-score: A Publication-based Metric for Academic Productivity,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07496,2015

10,"In a scientific publishing environment that is increasingly moving online, identifiers of scholarly work are gaining in importance. In this paper, we analysed identifier distribution and coverage of articles from the discipline of quantitative biology using arXiv, Mendeley and CrossRef as data sources. The results show that when retrieving arXiv articles from Mendeley, we were able to find more papers using the DOI than the arXiv ID. This indicates that DOI may be a better identifier with respect to findability. We also find that coverage of articles on Mendeley decreases in the most recent years, whereas the coverage of DOIs does not decrease in the same order of magnitude. This hints at the fact that there is a certain time lag involved, before articles are covered in crowd-sourced services on the scholarly web.","Kraker, Peter;Enkhbayar, Asura;Lex, Elisabeth",ArXiv e-prints,X015da91e1;X01a466841;X01c335933;X035b7ee6c;X04929e07f;X04db9b81f;X0517223e6;X05a8a5d10;X0654b4ce7;X0948d85e7;X0a31fdf09;X0b24e6167;X0b559beb5;X0bb577a13;X0ca1c04c3;X0da4af694;X0e5c02f87;X133afb955;X162701ac6;X184fc8990;X1b187a21b;X1b428b7a5;X1e6a8917a;X2080fea6f;X208dc404e;X210d4914c;X2196a6117;X21c60383c;X23f10e1e0;X24f8f6edb;X259ceb704;X2630f904e;X2694d51ab;X26b9730f1;X278540b36;X27a0a86e0;X2916cb14e;X29b4a3a60;X2bb5457c6;X2ef7fe3d7;X2eff79678;X35c3868db;X362e60f42;X3b357d612;X3ed64e3d1;X3f1f569a5;X3fb0ed7b2;X419a43344;X424cfde17;X44096c2b4;X44d9d5794;X4a42b3f8a;X4ba158dde;X4c3a9f77f;X4e1809577;X502e79b4f;X557f541cf;X56fd0ed2c;X5cb802067;X5df17651d;X5e8ae6126;X6222f3694;X6270efe53;X6639be126;X67af3b894;X69787a17a;X6c2a84962;X701f08843;X750765624;X75319ba5d;X75baaf6ac;X76b049f41;X777d9b03c;X7a9d6708e;X7b599993b;X7b9a520a7;X7e9f945cc;X7ffa92d61;X82d26ae85;X82e1a0516;X84a92dce2;X89a0ad978;X8e3516923;X94ba7afb2;X951e85096;X9718b8350;X988eb1e31;X9894090bc;X98a9ae22d;X9953604f9;X9f908fdb8;Xa013b3478;Xa30230692;Xa38a026cb;Xa428ca9a9;Xa4f21cdd4;Xa4f7d358d;Xa60067c5b;Xa60ea3d3b;Xa6c60e601;Xa8f72af54;Xb0c4eb841;Xb1c17b6a7;Xb603be461;Xb94560db2;Xbb4f51331;Xbd8fa6eaa;Xc01213e6e;Xc075ae6fa;Xc07d51da9;Xc1447692e;Xc369f5355;Xc4d406a12;Xc54e7f700;Xc6b8fa295;Xc6c1553a6;Xc7705bcb6;Xc7a37defd;Xc951e17c2;Xcb491c5f9;Xcea131f19;Xcece29756;Xd20c02f1f;Xd26d5af90;Xd44f89e3c;Xd6d722d3e;Xd8369ba55;Xd9c69cbc0;Xda8ff7643;Xdbfea6663;Xdc4dca7f9;Xdc8dd937a;Xdcb3e634d;Xdea020f9a;Xe1e3a8e6d;Xe20cd0ddf;Xe41c79469;Xe51e869bc;Xe5fb6d670;Xe73dcdb78;Xe77ea5b43;Xebac61328;Xee1757997;Xf223e55f6;Xf22e93231;Xf3d7c1067;Xf450c46cc;Xf4799c5a3;Xf4ebf8ce8;Xf808d0164;Xf8fb72f9d;Xfbb98e969;Xfcb0c1ebd;Xfd16c5b60;Xfe6303b20;Xfe7fb6d71,156,Exploring Coverage and Distribution of Identifiers on the Scholarly Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05096,2015
11,"In this paper we explore the possibility of using bibliographic databases for tracking the geographic origin of surnames. Surnames are used as a proxy to determine the ethnic, genetic or geographic origin of individuals in many fields such as Genetics or Demography; however they could also be used for bibliometric purposes such as the analysis of scientific migration flows. Here we present two relevant methodologies for determining the most probable country to which a surname could be assigned. The first methodology assigns surnames based on the most common country that can be assigned to a surname and the Kullback-Liebler divergence measure. The second method uses the Gini Index to evaluate the assignment of surnames to countries. We test both methodologies with control groups and conclude that, despite needing further analysis on its validity; these methodologies already show promising results.","Robinson-Garcia, Nicolas;Noyons, Ed;Costas, Rodrigo",ArXiv e-prints,X017b32d0a;X028ab43a4;X050ea014e;X06ac056f6;X06e9c776e;X0784d1127;X0954e8445;X09a018eb4;X0ad35f7c7;X0b559beb5;X0c17dc9ba;X0e4378faf;X0e8c1ddba;X10a1d5a18;X1297191d5;X19dd0db88;X1b187a21b;X1ba24c853;X1ce015912;X21898511c;X28c1ff339;X2bcf6248f;X2f0b818f3;X320fa5a59;X321afe71a;X361dedee0;X38411e57a;X38575e34c;X3c7f187f2;X3dc6ef6b0;X3fb0ed7b2;X413a11f25;X42e3ec88c;X44f7fd612;X45e266160;X46fe94790;X4770d29b0;X4775e5e46;X4c93bb86b;X4fd6cb7d9;X4ff4aa954;X5148fd731;X5df17651d;X5e4272229;X5f24f9832;X638b70a21;X644282b2e;X656033cc9;X66013d41d;X674531e05;X6759c8266;X682c02299;X6c7392047;X711f360e7;X712f171ac;X7630ea595;X76b2432b3;X78dca00ea;X79b11e4d4;X7b059242e;X7b9a520a7;X7d3d42731;X7d5117b0f;X7f4011c2c;X834579dc4;X86220f94c;X8762f6ba7;X883580c0b;X8b9ede3fe;X8ec6c6a36;X8f425ea69;X8ff6a7732;X930fdd990;X93771027b;X937a3501e;X94ba7afb2;X971c5f21f;X97517abd3;X978142a9b;X9a49532d6;X9ad23e252;X9b5425294;X9bb485bc5;X9c1ddadbe;X9c4449f74;X9d02aaa76;X9ff0a4a55;Xa2601b198;Xa3fbe50bf;Xaf7c79ffa;Xb30b32c13;Xb4c3197fc;Xb5b3f610c;Xb6870a807;Xb767275b5;Xb9075863a;Xba1bf254f;Xba1e3e4c0;Xbad3990b4;Xbafe7f784;Xbdd6d9066;Xbfd89ff9c;Xc01213e6e;Xc1f6bbbf5;Xc24396732;Xc271ab664;Xc4003ce21;Xc9ed2af70;Xcc4502a98;Xcc85914e9;Xd17bfe87b;Xd742811d3;Xd9c69cbc0;Xda123577c;Xddb0c57be;Xde164fdc8;Xde55dd8b1;Xdf8b220db;Xe0090da75;Xe1984595c;Xe416d6950;Xe57f6296a;Xe92a8c192;Xec0e55081;Xede143ca8;Xee471164f;Xf0f347e95;Xf239eada9;Xf434ad2c2;Xf532e6f1f;Xfe1dbc03b;Xff9c3bc5d,132,Can we track the geography of surnames based on bibliographic data?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05443,2015
12,"In this study, we compare the difference in the impact between open access (OA) and non-open access (non-OA) articles. 1761 Nature Communications articles published from 1 Jan. 2012 to 31 Aug. 2013 are selected as our research objects, including 587 OA articles and 1174 non-OA articles. Citation data and daily updated article-level metrics data are harvested directly from the platform of nature.com. Data is analyzed from the static versus temporal-dynamic perspectives. The OA citation advantage is confirmed, and the OA advantage is also applicable when extending the comparing from citation to article views and social media attention.

13,"A common consensus in the literature is that the citation profile of published articles in general follows a universal pattern - an initial growth in the number of citations within the first two to three years after publication followed by a steady peak of one to two years and then a final decline over the rest of the lifetime of the article. This observation has long been the underlying heuristic in determining major bibliometric factors such as the quality of a publication, the growth of scientific communities, impact factor of publication venues etc. In this paper, we gather and analyze a massive dataset of scientific papers from the computer science domain and notice that the citation count of the articles over the years follows a remarkably diverse set of patterns - a profile with an initial peak (PeakInit), with distinct multiple peaks (PeakMul), with a peak late in time (PeakLate), that is monotonically decreasing (MonDec), that is monotonically increasing (MonIncr) and that can not be categorized into any of the above (Oth). We conduct a thorough experiment to investigate several important characteristics of these categories such as how individual categories attract citations, how the categorization is influenced by the year and the venue of publication of papers, how each category is affected by self-citations, the stability of the categories over time, and how much each of these categories contribute to the core of the network. Further, we show that the traditional preferential attachment models fail to explain these citation profiles. Therefore, we propose a novel dynamic growth model that takes both the preferential attachment and the aging factor into account in order to replicate the real-world behavior of various citation profiles. We believe that this paper opens the scope for a serious re-investigation of the existing bibliometric indices for scientific research.","Chakraborty, Tanmoy;Kumar, Suhansanu;Goyal, Pawan;Ganguly, Niloy;Mukherjee, Animesh",ArXiv e-prints,5530ddda16;X02328144b;X02a5f5a3f;X08efc5319;X0a8348112;X0ad35f7c7;X0b559beb5;X0d91f5d3d;X0df85f1a6;X14838275e;X1b693b8a0;X1c21947e3;X1de03bdcf;X1ee65e90e;X22a73d51a;X24475cd66;X2d2e497e9;X2d821c8f0;X32065f0ed;X32bc3f3aa;X345e186e5;X34b2fae36;X40e7dea05;X466dab96f;X4b619f9bd;X4dbb4ff27;X50d53cb02;X54f89d902;X598c6aa61;X5a55d35f2;X5cdc2086d;X607a42853;X60e410849;X638b70a21;X649e9bfbd;X6902f283e;X6b0f48301;X6dcabacc4;X6e4312540;X6e996bbc9;X6ea1a13d0;X76abb74d9;X76ce7b6cb;X770a45bf9;X78678a281;X79b11e4d4;X7a84918c0;X7e6cad377;X7ed9d7f25;X80313a20c;X82690b573;X8e28e18c7;X8ec6c6a36;X90df27637;X961bb3d7a;X9926f3650;X9987e59d1;X99d9943a8;X9c322688e;Xa0be58bc6;Xa24ceea16;Xa2a7603ef;Xa3e4097c5;Xa96051def;Xa993c8e7f;Xabf26ec05;Xb6ca49dc9;Xb95ce8f66;Xb97207b22;Xbacf5c6e5;Xbc077e2fc;Xbc670a959;Xbc9da54f1;Xc01213e6e;Xc5369b53f;Xc54df483c;Xc9c9c9619;Xcaa657e9f;Xcbf44211b;Xd2272286b;Xd34360da9;Xd5639c7a3;Xd57465b24;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdf142d981;Xdf2c9211c;Xe086c5bba;Xe221007e7;Xe3edf1454;Xe4c7afe87;Xe8eae89fd;Xee471164f;Xf6defe198;Xfabeaae36;Xfe9d1a76b,95,On the categorization of scientific citation profiles in computer sciences,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06268,2015
14,"The ADS platform is undergoing the biggest rewrite of its 20-year history. While several components have been added to its architecture over the past couple of years, this talk will concentrate on the underpinnings of ADS's search layer and its API. To illustrate the design of the components in the new system, we will show how the new ADS user interface is built exclusively on top of the API using RESTful web services. Taking one step further, we will discuss how we plan to expose the treasure trove of information hosted by ADS (10 million records and fulltext for much of the Astronomy and Physics refereed literature) to partners interested in using this API. This will provide you (and your intelligent applications) with access to ADS's underlying data to enable the extraction of new knowledge and the ingestion of these results back into the ADS. Using this framework, researchers could run controlled experiments with content extraction, machine learning, natural language processing, etc. In this talk, we will discuss what is already implemented, what will be available soon, and where we are going next.","Chyla, Roman;Accomazzi, Alberto;Holachek, Alexandra;Grant, Carolyn S.;Elliott, Jonathan;Henneken, Edwin A.;Thompson, Donna M.;Kurtz, Michael J.;Murray, Stephen S.;Sudilovsky, Vladimir",ArXiv e-prints,4201071e72;465dc3fb1a;533d8b26f1;54ebaa1bb2;54f3a09ced;55205aaa53;X017b32d0a;X028ab43a4;X039dbaa6a;X05038fb4d;X050ea014e;X056bf9c4f;X05ad9f555;X0784d1127;X0b559beb5;X0c17dc9ba;X0e8c1ddba;X127911863;X15f0c021a;X17cf81301;X1ac46aa42;X1b187a21b;X1f0ec7425;X1f75ffad3;X21dfa3347;X24475cd66;X256bcfe32;X272cbb851;X339a73fcc;X413a11f25;X4194692ef;X42e3ec88c;X45e266160;X46fe94790;X4770d29b0;X4994f34ac;X4a6c80484;X4ea0218b0;X569d527c4;X585fd6173;X5c7981e8c;X5df17651d;X605493f93;X6233a8754;X656033cc9;X66013d41d;X66c3295d9;X6be837466;X6c7392047;X6e996bbc9;X716518c31;X78500393a;X7e4f1b619;X86220f94c;X940e42e77;X989125c83;X9bb485bc5;X9fcd7abbd;Xa3fbe50bf;Xa76871a1e;Xaa4461fc5;Xb4c3197fc;Xb5b3f610c;Xb9075863a;Xba1bf254f;Xba1e3e4c0;Xbdd6d9066;Xc33d544ad;Xd17bfe87b;Xd3d457cf6;Xd9c69cbc0;Xda0461fec;Xe221007e7;Xe2b1f71c1;Xe92a8c192;Xe94e9788b;Xef358bcbe;Xf06279c7d;Xfa6e2f97d,79,"ADS 2.0: new architecture, API and services",http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05881,2015

16,Mark-and-Recapture is a methodology from Population Biology to estimate the number of a species without counting every individual. This is done by multiple samplings of the species using traps and discounting the instances that were caught repeated. In this paper we show that this methodology is applicable for citation analysis as it is also not feasible to count all the relevant publications of a research topic. In addition this estimation also allows us to propose a stopping rule for researchers to decide how far one should extend their search for relevant literature.,"Loe, Chuan Wen;Jeldtoft Jensen, Henrik",ArXiv e-prints,X05a8a5d10;X0948d85e7;X0ad35f7c7;X0b559beb5;X0d6dec402;X0d91f5d3d;X0f6ade7ff;X114840220;X15183a9d9;X15d9975ee;X162d86e34;X1817c1086;X18e4d7906;X197e1cc9e;X19e75c2d0;X1ee65e90e;X1f068d852;X1f6cd30de;X1f75ffad3;X1f9e45071;X210d4914c;X216cf3ca8;X21fd28a2d;X22a73d51a;X23d3c7580;X24152b898;X2864bc60d;X2a077f892;X2a629ced1;X2cb99fc09;X2d71c3a69;X2d821c8f0;X2dbb0400b;X2f052bcd6;X2fab433c5;X35ec75c6c;X35f031a9a;X393087a9e;X3936718db;X39dfe0f6d;X3a1b35a3b;X3b61dc4ab;X3bb59c27e;X3fb0ed7b2;X429695f82;X442e617b1;X46c39dcee;X483adec20;X48a46fe42;X4b619f9bd;X4b96c7cb5;X4ba952907;X4e2701d17;X4f6ea6487;X5230bebd9;X52d39b59b;X53f1eb4a7;X550fadc40;X58094f99f;X58fbe0749;X595119947;X5a55d35f2;X5b8b512cf;X5b9a49342;X5cdc2086d;X5d114a53f;X5db747f61;X5fca946a3;X606d441b2;X60e410849;X6233a8754;X623426da7;X623f4239b;X637cfbd32;X666dc200d;X6719f9195;X693a48449;X6990b9ac6;X6ab8d94e2;X6bdbbc681;X6cc9aec21;X6d3f61a3f;X6d818bbdb;X6dcabacc4;X6f8a207d9;X6fcec4c91;X7085f8ddb;X709da335c;X70c0d55ac;X71311c046;X755efe0ad;X769b7754b;X775e67102;X78f3f1285;X791a5889a;X7dc02947a;X7ebdb211e;X7ed9d7f25;X80313a20c;X82690b573;X84a92dce2;X886df29de;X8bc67cba7;X8e41dbfa2;X8ec6c6a36;X8f217e901;X8f425ea69;X930fdd990;X956e78961;X961bb3d7a;X971c5f21f;X97acd9d70;X9926f3650;X99ccf56bd;X9af5b82c2;X9c322688e;X9d41bf67d;Xa013b3478;Xa07b6a2f3;Xa38a026cb;Xa49760ded;Xa61adadae;Xa659a8bc4;Xa8a88bb5f;Xac3515e38;Xac636d304;Xace8be817;Xaef590431;Xaef6b873d;Xb05ccdce2;Xb3c551d72;Xb46f8ed24;Xb4c99add3;Xb6ca49dc9;Xb897a8d10;Xbacf5c6e5;Xbb07dcc49;Xbebdef451;Xc01213e6e;Xc337aa09c;Xc56f46136;Xca4874172;Xcaa657e9f;Xcc0f7dfd2;Xccd88aa61;Xcf2cbff1f;Xd17bfe87b;Xd22bb8342;Xd2831fa6e;Xd6f93799d;Xd7cba2e56;Xd9c69cbc0;Xda186b57f;Xdeb2596cb;Xdf0ea646b;Xe1da15e79;Xe20a4eac8;Xe221007e7;Xe2b2b40f0;Xe51e869bc;Xe5fbd7662;Xe60743f4b;Xe696a338a;Xe7104cd5f;Xe7d0eb986;Xe866a8fe4;Xea38677fd;Xeba197444;Xedc2a2cd8;Xee471164f;Xf1e6dd42e;Xf2bf4faa1;Xf56b834e3;Xf65ec6f42;Xf675ed7e7;Xf6defe198;Xf7b521a3c;Xf83e7d949;Xf886532e8;Xf951f9f65;Xfa0c74fc3;Xfd8e8aa96;Xff693b1a2;Xff768083b,184,Citation Analysis with Mark-and-Recapture,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06584,2015

19,"We show here how a simple data mining of bibliographic records can be used to follow and help understand the evolution of a research domain, at a level that cannot be captured by reading individual papers in a field of this size. We illustrate the approach by investigating 43 years of research on ceramic materials, covered by 253k bibliographic records. The patterns of keywords used reveal the trends and the evolution of research ideas and priorities within the field. Simple, interactive tools based on co-word network analysis help us better appreciate the organization and relationships of ideas or individuals, and hopefully allow identification of unexplored concepts, connections, or approaches on a given topic.","Deville, Sylvain;Stevenson, Adam J.",ArXiv

20,"The UDC (Universal Decimal Classification) is not only a classification language with a long history; it also presents a complex cognitive system worthy of the attention of complexity theory. The elements of the UDC: classes, auxiliaries, and operations are combined into symbolic strings, which in essence represent a complex networks of concepts. This network forms a backbone of ordering of knowledge and at the same time allows expression of different perspectives on various products of human knowledge production. In this paper we look at UDC strings derived from the holdings of libraries. In particular we analyse the subject headings of holdings of the university library in Leuven, and an extraction of UDC numbers from the OCLC WorldCat. Comparing those sets with the Master Reference File, we look into the length of strings, the occurrence of different auxiliary signs, and the resulting connections between UDC classes. We apply methods and representations from complexity theory. Mapping out basic statistics on UDC classes as used in libraries from a point of view of complexity theory bears different benefits. Deploying its structure could serve as an overview and basic information for users among the nature and focus of specific collections. A closer view into combined UDC numbers reveals the complex nature of the UDC as an example for a knowledge ordering system, which deserves future exploration from a complexity theoretical perspective.","Smiraglia, Richard;Scharnhorst, Andrea;Akdag Salah, Almila;Gao, Cheng",ArXiv e-prints,X15043d35b;X19327aab9;X2acd8c062;X2b1ff52a0;X35559c62f;X484a1154b;X48a77c0d1;X64978f896;X6bfdd08fd;X6c49f0fdc;X72a87e1d3;X985ced3b3;Xa95cd2c01;Xa9dc9ff23;Xa9e096294;Xb8789cf88;Xc047e8658;Xdad0cd769;Xee471164f;Xf0bdc6578,20,UDC in Action,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3783,2013
21,"The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation ran an Investigator Competition as part of its Data-Driven Discovery Initiative in 2014. We received about 1,100 applications and each applicant had the opportunity to list up to five {\em influential works} in the general field of ""Big Data"" for scientific discovery. We collected nearly 5,000 references and 53 works were cited at least six times. This paper contains our preliminary findings.","Stalzer, Mark;Mentzel, Chris",ArXiv

22,"In recent times, the academic ecosystem has seen a tremendous growth in number of authors and publications. While most temporal studies in this area focus on evolution of co-author and citation network structure, this systemic inflation has received very little attention. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a population model for academia, derived from publication records in the Computer Science domain. We use a generalized branching process as an overarching framework, which enables us to describe the evolution and composition of the research community in a systematic manner. Further, the observed patterns allow us to shed light on researchers' lifecycle encompassing arrival, academic life expectancy, activity, productivity and offspring distribution in the ecosystem. We believe such a study will help develop better bibliometric indices which account for the inflation, and also provide insights into sustainable and efficient resource management for academia.","Wu, Yan;Venkatramanan, Srinivasan;Chiu, Dah Ming",ArXiv e-prints,52fcb84ea0;X0086c49c4;X018505316;X01a466841;X048299ba0;X05a8a5d10;X063504b0d;X063f16ebd;X066895e69;X0918eaa41;X0b001a5cc;X0b559beb5;X0bb577a13;X124bcd52e;X152f1a003;X16dae5a60;X1702cd926;X183cd3279;X1844b7ab9;X197e1cc9e;X1c20a3228;X1d2aec6fa;X1d6695c8e;X1e0946b99;X1e5422b7a;X210d4914c;X21c60383c;X228c4fc4b;X2336ce602;X23b88ea94;X2494df632;X254719239;X25a96758d;X272842d09;X291c3fa29;X29c5d1b2b;X2bd414e0b;X2ccdeab63;X2cdb8a649;X2d5ac6208;X2e21b0c22;X2f052bcd6;X2f0b818f3;X2ff674135;X30073da52;X30c1d3f48;X30cd2689b;X33294a8de;X35e98ecec;X35f031a9a;X366bf3201;X368fe8540;X38d791765;X3900d3b76;X393604e08;X3a13bda4c;X3a1b35a3b;X3aec75b6a;X3d7a244b0;X3d8237445;X3e2eec870;X3e8dc3f86;X3fece5344;X3ff3dc398;X40c57f4bc;X40cb2ada9;X41c09052b;X424cfde17;X445f2ea8a;X448688ce8;X44d853d74;X4531862f6;X46c39dcee;X475ed5f36;X477957161;X482ba637d;X491d70893;X4974c0f72;X498db336f;X49ca1c429;X4ab040308;X4b6e0384f;X4bcada76b;X4ce718d76;X4dd6f436c;X4e0d803d9;X4e12d5608;X521c2e83a;X5221926f2;X53a702357;X53d5fdcdd;X53ee02f94;X55dac4f6b;X56d07593c;X58dea0a4d;X5a9e93ed4;X5ba24b0cc;X5cf05fecb;X5e4272229;X5e8ae6126;X5ff974c5b;X61f07c325;X6270efe53;X62acc3a3d;X632ed6034;X6338a2696;X63fa8e323;X64f720c86;X65b7abec0;X666fa969c;X67c5d1f4d;X6ae3d55ee;X6c5d0c883;X6cc9aec21;X6eadbaae1;X6f5473636;X701f08843;X71e058f71;X74565a356;X75b6fd94e;X7603316e6;X76f985068;X784f378cf;X78f3f1285;X794b98f6e;X7980ccb5e;X7c281a185;X7ed9d7f25;X7f4011c2c;X7f64bd58a;X7f7055b6d;X80336b870;X82d1a498b;X82d26ae85;X843c9b0e0;X848eef912;X85bcd142e;X87debf2a8;X899a3ca67;X8af009b89;X8c46bc694;X8d666fae4;X8f33739eb;X9002849db;X9501b840d;X95984c141;X95a7a77ff;X9919148a4;X9f05dc404;X9f11bcc55;Xa20014211;Xa209f4c06;Xa25e25fd0;Xa2a7603ef;Xa659a8bc4;Xa6c1e1f69;Xa78f7abdb;Xa7c8d9db6;Xa7fe76be8;Xa962a3773;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xaaee5c835;Xab2b05b07;Xac2943056;Xad069d522;Xaebe9cd5a;Xafce36eb2;Xb177e6f81;Xb541b45c7;Xb5fc6aaf1;Xb7b920db6;Xb870f9ed9;Xbbb6ab754;Xbbbd433fe;Xbbef692dd;Xbe834b3e4;Xbe895c90a;Xbe8fbc237;Xbe98cd561;Xbf54f8ec7;Xc1c68d29c;Xc273aaec4;Xc83915df8;Xc884f3376;Xc9da4f352;Xccaf045da;Xcccbc2c07;Xccd88aa61;Xcfeda5eed;Xd1909851a;Xd2aee4a34;Xd4c8484df;Xd7d3213d0;Xd905c18ad;Xd97e99cc8;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdbe0be21b;Xdc0512d75;Xdc4dca7f9;Xdd438f00e;Xdd6fc26a6;Xddbc544dd;Xdf226d1eb;Xdf2c9211c;Xdfc151109;Xdfd3c4fc2;Xe0e445cc3;Xe18709cd4;Xe1b21aa4b;Xe221007e7;Xe2daf857c;Xe3f32c52f;Xe4521abfb;Xe6e1d7682;Xe71d36bf7;Xeb85f2dc7;Xec15fc2b8;Xed74e8e6b;Xed8bdddd9;Xed8d6c81f;Xee5575ed0;Xeea051f3b;Xef564050a;Xf14e17229;Xf2acfc2d4;Xf641b5334;Xf672f727d;Xf726e3b1a;Xf886532e8;Xf8b755325;Xf9390a7d1;Xf959e818c;Xfa57f649e;Xff4189165;Xffa157c4c;Xffb632901,236,A Population Model for the Academic Ecosystem,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08312,2015
23,"We prove that Ochiai similarity of the co-occurrence matrix is equal to cosine similarity in the underlying occurrence matrix. Neither the cosine nor the Pearson correlation should be used for the normalization of co-occurrence matrices because the similarity is then normalized twice, and therefore over-estimated; the Ochiai coefficient can be used instead. Results are shown using a small matrix (5 cases, 4 variables) for didactic reasons, and also Ahlgren et al.'s (2003) co-occurrence matrix of 24 authors in library and information sciences. The over-estimation is shown numerically and will be illustrated using multidimensional scaling and cluster dendograms. If the occurrence matrix is not available (such as in internet research or author co-citation analysis) using Ochiai for the normalization is preferable to using the cosine.","Zhou, Qiuju;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,550e6ff01f;554167a01a;X01438bb9f;X04f87fb9d;X0517223e6;X055a6bf93;X056bf9c4f;X059ca0548;X05b0a2da8;X05c5d4d26;X078797e13;X0b2a57382;X0b559beb5;X0d9b4cd1f;X0f0f921f0;X1058f1deb;X127911863;X13a5d66bf;X1639b05e5;X16c289e74;X172add237;X177267dc8;X189d9312c;X18ad07292;X199c7446e;X1ac46aa42;X1aeb06f62;X1b580ba2b;X1eba13d69;X210d4914c;X2262ac269;X2494df632;X24c95b502;X25d188752;X266cc033f;X269e71774;X29c5d1b2b;X2dd1d040e;X2fa1552eb;X2fa33fb96;X393604e08;X3d636a67d;X3d7a244b0;X409da97e0;X40f5e39ed;X43e3ca186;X454526fbf;X46225990b;X46c39dcee;X4749d410d;X49103e0ed;X4a52bfe40;X4e7d18338;X4eecde324;X50e4a359a;X513b32559;X5568f37a7;X55a7d70c9;X573598f19;X5a9e93ed4;X5b9a49342;X5fb6d1daa;X62a891295;X63bf51ef5;X63dc98c34;X668ce3bb7;X670b9ffad;X6927b0dc7;X69523414b;X6d3036b24;X6fb88900b;X703a8a2df;X71c0a0bad;X73771c792;X74565a356;X75baaf6ac;X7813dd121;X784d165e6;X78708257b;X78dca00ea;X7e14d41b6;X7ed9d7f25;X7f4011c2c;X831319e93;X8365075c9;X837ea3299;X85879bfa4;X886c4aacf;X8a84c2dac;X8b0daf1fb;X8ca7833fb;X8ec6c6a36;X8f425ea69;X901e0fe88;X90637dd72;X97cb31fbb;X992e4a4c0;X9a8ad50a3;X9ac3c6ae0;X9bbe9b1a9;X9bd08f29e;X9c73c7235;X9d7a7d049;X9d8588c10;X9e0a9514d;Xa11466bf7;Xa87302ca2;Xa969ef413;Xa9d52d0f6;Xab18a8335;Xacbb33736;Xaf68ddb6d;Xb207c6ed4;Xb5c8db97d;Xb5f7188bf;Xb6551b5a6;Xb74af53ab;Xb779f032e;Xbbfa2d732;Xbf00c5658;Xc01213e6e;Xc2739bafa;Xc64140533;Xc975759c4;Xca9606066;Xcba0cfd73;Xce22640f8;Xce48fef13;Xd1909851a;Xd42ee2c8b;Xd44f9bbcd;Xd5ab6b050;Xd83833d9f;Xd97e99cc8;Xd9ab9c96e;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdae6fef6a;Xdf2ac53aa;Xdf2c9211c;Xdfcb71d8d;Xe49b8e22d;Xe65d999b4;Xe85c6cb6a;Xe8960466b;Xe928f7e6b;Xe9b72a948;Xea7e5e58b;Xebd6e13f0;Xed4b81e60;Xee67e4476;Xf14cc63b0;Xf167c872a;Xf2517d8a2;Xf27e0a861;Xfaab0725a;Xfbb921a46,156,The Normalization of Occurrence and Co-occurrence Matrices in Bibliometrics using Cosine Similarities and Ochiai Coefficients,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08944,2015
24,"A fundamental problem in citation analysis is the prediction of the long-term citation impact of recent publications. We propose a model to predict a probability distribution for the future number of citations of a publication. Two predictors are used: The impact factor of the journal in which a publication has appeared and the number of citations a publication has received one year after its appearance. The proposed model is based on quantile regression. We employ the model to predict the future number of citations of a large set of publications in the field of physics. Our analysis shows that both predictors (i.e., impact factor and early citations) contribute to the accurate prediction of long-term citation impact. We also analytically study the behavior of the quantile regression coefficients for high quantiles of the distribution of citations. This is done by linking the quantile regression approach to a quantile estimation technique from extreme value theory. Our work provides insight into the influence of the impact factor and early citations on the long-term citation impact of a publication, and it takes a step toward a methodology that can be used to assess research institutions based on their most recently published work.","Stegehuis, Clara;Litvak, Nelly;Waltman, Ludo",ArXiv e-prints,5518f72389;X000789272;X02f67aa48;X048299ba0;X04f3d407c;X05103cb0d;X0517223e6;X05a8a5d10;X05c5d4d26;X078797e13;X082d87bcd;X0933c4d37;X0954e8445;X0a31fdf09;X0b24e6167;X0b559beb5;X0d2500f23;X0e325a5e4;X0f21129e5;X10854176c;X1285ccc37;X13a5d66bf;X13ba24739;X14477cd23;X16ee2c79b;X1882ec132;X18a9fec45;X197e1cc9e;X1a76fd33b;X1ac46aa42;X1aeb06f62;X1c7f1353c;X1cf89f3da;X1d0b2eca3;X1de03bdcf;X1f90c86d9;X211a4d3fa;X21c60383c;X21cd19d88;X22ecc84f2;X259761dff;X269fbab47;X27458499d;X276375fdd;X27919a0ba;X29a055d7a;X29c5d1b2b;X2a2ee9ecf;X2af0a8b8e;X2b70e1bf4;X2c090d62e;X2cb99fc09;X2cf0d2aac;X2db070b4a;X2e67571cb;X2e7755488;X2e8e15269;X2f0b818f3;X2f909457b;X2fa33fb96;X30cd2689b;X319ed24f9;X32f61a234;X3539442ec;X35e258362;X362e60f42;X3a13bda4c;X3b09689f6;X3d7ec5495;X3d843a54e;X3f1f569a5;X3f5c170c3;X3fece5344;X42345df31;X425978d61;X437f25af1;X443830b8c;X44e554284;X453a162ba;X4749d410d;X4a4e682a6;X4b906d55f;X4bd0ece2c;X4c0056866;X4cc71c6f9;X4d1a76feb;X4e3fa00bc;X504220cc7;X504b1c5e8;X54477d2c0;X55dac4f6b;X55f681539;X56fc305d3;X57278d530;X595119947;X5968f168c;X5a9e93ed4;X5c8fa2b8c;X5cb802067;X5cceb5fbd;X5d81d4b37;X5db58e326;X5e42e0c64;X60a6a8516;X60d4ac831;X611c27226;X637161292;X64d5554d4;X65b7abec0;X6864e7b37;X6927b0dc7;X697f36432;X6cc9aec21;X6e3431129;X6ee0d7ae7;X6ff0334f0;X703a8a2df;X71490e16e;X722cb4828;X733498c61;X7447a26d0;X74565a356;X75baaf6ac;X7603316e6;X7687697dc;X777d9b03c;X77e54e30e;X7813dd121;X78dca00ea;X7a19c8c6e;X7a8960413;X7b272f5b9;X7d0fde2ed;X7d3d3698d;X7daecdffb;X7e892c523;X7ed9d7f25;X7f05b58f5;X818967884;X827b39e55;X829cdaf9c;X82d26ae85;X831319e93;X83943ea24;X85223adae;X855917b4d;X8665b211b;X87a23018f;X8810142f4;X882ef9f2d;X8ae256bc6;X8b9ede3fe;X8bbecf9fa;X8ec6c6a36;X8f301427d;X8f425ea69;X91b908b8f;X92dbd1ec9;X94ba7afb2;X96a2cd00d;X975b70529;X98cf66cea;X99fa40989;X9c035d17d;X9c87604af;X9d02aaa76;X9d183d621;X9d934b999;X9e5b44a92;X9eca4fc9e;X9f92ac4c8;Xa0ae8c162;Xa0f120169;Xa2c3cb6c4;Xa647cf518;Xa659a8bc4;Xa8f72af54;Xad7beda32;Xae5e29618;Xae64c797e;Xaec155dfb;Xb045c640f;Xb061ec840;Xb075d2885;Xb1f838234;Xb207c6ed4;Xb35a0f76f;Xb39960a1a;Xb46d6a791;Xb5f7188bf;Xb6433407d;Xb6c18ffab;Xb72053472;Xb79981e98;Xb7a74f3f8;Xb8b5b0349;Xbb4dd3fc2;Xbb9327eef;Xbbc857778;Xbbd483160;Xbbfa2d732;Xbd00351fa;Xbd6e339f3;Xbd96cb50c;Xbe9665da5;Xbf00c5658;Xbf54f8ec7;Xc01213e6e;Xc0342a229;Xc369f5355;Xc78dfa1ab;Xc87cf733e;Xc8f953712;Xcae784ec4;Xcbc07ea18;Xcf1438014;Xcf5ef543f;Xd02ab01a2;Xd0a69351e;Xd0f2ca77b;Xd1909851a;Xd3a4c62ab;Xd42ee2c8b;Xd57465b24;Xd5c942fd0;Xd69c8b848;Xd6ab4862f;Xd6f787b13;Xd97e99cc8;Xd9ab9c96e;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdcd0671f9;Xdcd46b8ea;Xdf2ac53aa;Xdf2c9211c;Xe04cbb936;Xe221007e7;Xe277c4153;Xe3003f4bc;Xe354fd0f8;Xe43af8ea9;Xe6e1d7682;Xe70f8e881;Xe90735cf7;Xe9212cce4;Xeb85f2dc7;Xec64f4938;Xec6e51643;Xeca18577f;Xed54abb40;Xef95dfa71;Xf14783cf3;Xf3f20828b;Xf434ad2c2;Xf72efbefd;Xf886532e8;Xf8b755325;Xf959e818c;Xf97ac454e;Xf9e5d3a76;Xfe1c8c814;Xfe7fb6d71,262,Predicting the long-term citation impact of recent publications,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.09156,2015
25,"To manage the problem of having a higher demand for resources than availability of funds, research funding agencies usually rank the major research groups in their area of knowledge. This ranking relies on a careful analysis of the research groups in terms of their size, number of PhDs graduated, research results and their impact, among other variables. While research results are not the only variable to consider, they are frequently given special attention because of the notoriety they confer to the researchers and the programs they are affiliated with. In here we introduce a new metric for quantifying publication output, called R-Score for reputation-based score, which can be used in support to the ranking of research groups or programs. The novelty is that the metric depends solely on the listings of the publications of the members of a group, with no dependency on citation counts. R-Score has some interesting properties: (a) it does not require access to the contents of published material, (b) it can be curated to produce highly accurate results, and (c) it can be naturally used to compare publication output of research groups (e.g., graduate programs) inside a same country, geographical area, or across the world. An experiment comparing the publication output of 25 CS graduate programs from Brazil suggests that R-Score can be quite useful for providing early insights into the publication patterns of the various research groups one wants to compare.","Ribas, Sabir;Ribeiro-Neto, Berthier;Silva, Edmundo de Souza e;Ziviani, Nivio",ArXiv e-prints,X1767e1479;X27525feed;X406f765e3;X45bcab8da;X4f8d315c0;X56294722e;X60cd1d085;X6736fdbcc;X798c4910f;X7b5a68643;X88a6cf91b;X92f663c44;Xa60ea3d3b;Xb8adc9ad3;Xc00261596;Xcd6e61b09;Xd16795d8e;Xd2b327f00;Xd52f2be1b;Xdae12f7a8;Xdc7c3c3a2;Xe4dd28dec;Xe55e87c2c;Xeb5a02bbd;Xed0e981cd;Xff9c3bc5d,26,R-Score: Reputation-based Scoring of Research Groups,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5286,2013
26,"Social media metrics - commonly coined as ""altmetrics"" - have been heralded as great democratizers of science, providing broader and timelier indicators of impact than citations. These metrics come from a range of sources, including Twitter, blogs, social reference managers, post-publication peer review, and other social media platforms. Social media metrics have begun to be used as indicators of scientific impact, yet the theoretical foundation, empirical validity, and extent of use of platforms underlying these metrics lack thorough treatment in the literature. This editorial provides an overview of terminology and definitions of altmetrics and summarizes current research regarding social media use in academia, social media metrics as well as data reliability and validity. The papers of the special issue are introduced.","Haustein, Stefanie;Sugimoto, Cassidy R.;Larivière, Vincent",ArXiv e-prints,5544ee014c;X01f433731;X03653d2d1;X03edbeb25;X05a8a5d10;X0654b4ce7;X0863d55a6;X0a31fdf09;X0b502c5d1;X0e3393ead;X0e86686b4;X15183a9d9;X1639b05e5;X189483629;X1aeb06f62;X1bfdacf27;X1feda28eb;X1ffd8f254;X212d1ab1b;X21e51d306;X28254a015;X2b3aeea33;X2e1f81e01;X2f909457b;X30e6dd0e4;X35c3868db;X36f727cd8;X3a01366b1;X3a51eb02c;X3b8f2a358;X3ead65e0d;X3eadd6d8a;X43e3ca186;X46c7f7dce;X4adb569a4;X4b9a81f42;X4f67fc4bd;X56d5a6f02;X570e4b1d9;X57a03560f;X5a51ba639;X5a9e93ed4;X5cb802067;X5e4272229;X64cc2a7cb;X68db96647;X6a1381cd9;X6c62f57d9;X6dfcaef66;X6f4f2d431;X6ff0334f0;X70b7e9dad;X70f5e4c92;X729c9f09a;X7478c6a43;X75319ba5d;X75baaf6ac;X75c8c3086;X772566289;X777d9b03c;X78dca00ea;X7a34d61c5;X7f4011c2c;X82d26ae85;X85ba5e9b7;X87729a23e;X8833d03fa;X894b76555;X89bac503f;X900d8e496;X91b30b2e9;X92c60034c;X9394c39de;X96a2cd00d;X9718b8350;X99fa40989;X9c6e4e97a;X9d02aaa76;X9eab144c2;Xa0971fd13;Xa2fdb60df;Xa7163075d;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xaab1b7f5f;Xacc9251f2;Xb0b6151d7;Xb0ca5c0fa;Xb2859eeb5;Xb46d6a791;Xb767275b5;Xb76ecd4c6;Xbbfdf3fca;Xbf65e73af;Xc10c7c14c;Xc271be656;Xc369f5355;Xc37c589e6;Xc410a7cfa;Xc4f4fd462;Xc54e7f700;Xc92f9644e;Xcae784ec4;Xcddea854a;Xd00ddc803;Xd0a69351e;Xd1909851a;Xd2aee4a34;Xd42ee2c8b;Xd6f93799d;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdb2c3b1c7;Xdcd0671f9;Xe28f64a3f;Xe354fd0f8;Xe4d042885;Xe70852b82;Xed87f4270;Xed933f01c;Xefc3fe2b2;Xf434ad2c2;Xf808d0164;Xf8b755325;Xfa22f9dc6;Xfb9429b7b;Xfde15e014;Xfe5534078;Xff46f9081,127,Social media in scholarly communication,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01877,2015
27,"The subject area of this report is Linked Data and its application to the Government domain. Linked Data is an alternative method of data representation that aims to interlink data from varied sources through relationships. Governments around the world have started publishing their data in this format to assist citizens in making better use of public services. This report provides an eight step migrational framework for converting Singapore Government data from legacy systems to Linked Data format. The framework formulation is based on a study of the Singapore data ecosystem with help from Infocomm Development Authority (iDA) of Singapore. Each step in the migrational framework has been constructed with objectives, recommendations, best practices and issues with entry and exit points. This work builds on the existing Linked Data literature, implementations in other countries and cookbooks provided by Linked Data researchers. iDA can use this report to gain an understanding of the effort and work involved in the implementation of Linked Data system on top of their legacy systems. The framework can be evaluated by building a Proof of Concept (POC) application.","Sesagiri Raamkumar, Aravind;Kumaar Thangavelu, Muthu;Khoo, Sudarsan Kaleeswaran amd Christopher S.

29,"Trilogy is a collaborative project whose key aim is the development of an integrated virtual laboratory to support research training within each institution and collaborative projects between the partners. In this paper, the architecture and underpinning platform of the system is described with particular emphasis being placed on the structure and the integration of the distributed database. A key element is the ontology that provides the multi-agent system with a conceptualisation specification of the domain; this ontology is explained, accompanied by a discussion how such a system is integrated and used within the virtual laboratory. Although in this paper, Telecommunications and in particular Broadband networks are used as exemplars, the underlying system principles are applicable to any domain where a combination of experimental and literature-based resources are required.","Chevalier, Franck;Harle, David;Smith, Geoffrey",ArXiv e-prints,X21b7e4a53;X2707b8cd0;X49aa950a1,3,Resource Discovery in Trilogy,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902015,1999
30,"The peer-review process, in its present form, has been repeatedly criticized. Of the many critiques ranging from publication delays to referee bias, this paper will focus specifically on the issue of how submitted manuscripts are distributed to qualified referees. Unqualified referees, without the proper knowledge of a manuscript's domain, may reject a perfectly valid study or potentially more damaging, unknowingly accept a faulty or fraudulent result. In this paper, referee competence is analyzed with respect to referee bid data collected from the 2005 Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL). The analysis of the referee bid behavior provides a validation of the intuition that referees are bidding on conference submissions with regards to the subject domain of the submission. Unfortunately, this relationship is not strong and therefore suggests that there exists other factors beyond subject domain that may be influencing referees to bid for particular submissions.","Rodriguez, Marko A.;Bollen, Johan;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X36efab5bf;X56eb90aab;Xa39d6a547;Xb460553a1;Xf9a37d050,5,Mapping the Bid Behavior of Conference Referees,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605110,2006
31,"We present results of expanding the contents of the China Biographical Database by text mining historical local gazetteers, difangzhi. The goal of the database is to see how people are connected together, through kinship, social connections, and the places and offices in which they served. The gazetteers are the single most important collection of names and offices covering the Song through Qing periods. Although we begin with local officials we shall eventually include lists of local examination candidates, people from the locality who served in government, and notable local figures with biographies. The more data we collect the more connections emerge. The value of doing systematic text mining work is that we can identify relevant connections that are either directly informative or can become useful without deep historical research. Academia Sinica is developing a name database for officials in the central governments of the Ming and Qing dynasties.","Bol, Peter K.;Liu, Chao-Lin;Wang, Hongsu",ArXiv e-prints,X05e37a64e;X08595a2a3;X0b51ecf87;X0c7471920;X0dc2b3e07;X0e6ec043d;X0e8a173b4;X130660fd3;X1691fdff6;X172add237;X1aeb06f62;X1ee00808c;X2413093b9;X24ac4e84c;X27e39e207;X27fb5b077;X28f413ae5;X2be6e3c72;X2e5b137c7;X318d1b390;X325a205cd;X32e5a618b;X332253862;X338404f4d;X34110efab;X3b276a18c;X3b7dae67e;X4213738f5;X42764725d;X43c115de6;X47126419f;X48fc34f1c;X4bdf831e7;X4efef8bc3;X5a51ba639;X5a9e93ed4;X5af1ff7a9;X63b5c9e20;X65e4c7ad4;X67917f309;X67af3b894;X6e46f554f;X6fb87326e;X702d22a2d;X70b2c6e4a;X710f9f040;X71d7e0c84;X7276fa0f7;X73f8aa9f6;X77dc3abc7;X7813dd121;X7a34d61c5;X7b45c831d;X7f4011c2c;X8568c6f2b;X87c46fcc5;X899b6d40a;X8da31b1ba;X8eb0b0c33;X8ec8b2ea6;X903967f76;X92e763781;X9363b2ff3;X93d1e637c;X94f3963e2;X952c01a79;X97506b880;X9751c154a;X98331179e;X9a7e7f00c;X9d183d621;X9dbdc6cab;X9e25f751a;X9fafb6ed6;Xa114d1122;Xa16bc76a1;Xa39981b5d;Xab1976b11;Xacc191aff;Xacc9251f2;Xafccf756c;Xb0cfeefb0;Xbe4e39122;Xc5a7b6608;Xca8b86650;Xcd2b5fad5;Xceb69c0f0;Xcf1fd1ee9;Xd0b9a17d9;Xd1909851a;Xd1c6502f5;Xd361a1062;Xd5ad9560b;Xd9c69cbc0;Xe03f556c2;Xe2b1f71c1;Xe3ffebeec;Xecadc59fc;Xee6918665;Xf40d2a26b;Xfb056b509;Xfde15e014;Xfdfa40d02;Xff840f54e,104,Mining and discovering biographical information in Difangzhi with a language-model-based approach,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02148,2015
32,"In bibliometrics studies, a common challenge is how to deal with incorrect or incomplete data. However, given a large volume of data, there often exists certain relationships between the data items that can allow us to recover missing data items and correct erroneous data. In this paper, we study a particular problem of this sort - estimating the missing year information associated with publications (and hence authors' years of active publication). We first propose a simple algorithm that only makes use of the ""direct"" information, such as paper citation/reference relationships or paper-author relationships. The result of this simple algorithm is used as a benchmark for comparison. Our goal is to develop algorithms that increase both the coverage (the percentage of missing year papers recovered) and accuracy (mean absolute error of the estimated year to the real year). We propose some advanced algorithms that extend inference by information propagation. For each algorithm, we propose three versions according to the given academic social network type: a) Homogeneous (only contains paper citation links), b) Bipartite (only contains paper-author relations), and, c) Heterogeneous (both paper citation and paper-author relations). We carry out experiments on the three public data sets (MSR Libra, DBLP and APS), and evaluated by applying the K-fold cross validation method. We show that the advanced algorithms can improve both coverage and accuracy.","Fu, Tom Z.

33,"We computed linguistic information at the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels for Recognizing Inference in Text (RITE) tasks for both traditional and simplified Chinese in NTCIR-9 and NTCIR-10. Techniques for syntactic parsing, named-entity recognition, and near synonym recognition were employed, and features like counts of common words, statement lengths, negation words, and antonyms were considered to judge the entailment relationships of two statements, while we explored both heuristics-based functions and machine-learning approaches. The reported systems showed robustness by simultaneously achieving second positions in the binary-classification subtasks for both simplified and traditional Chinese in NTCIR-10 RITE-2. We conducted more experiments with the test data of NTCIR-9 RITE, with good results. We also extended our work to search for better configurations of our classifiers and investigated contributions of individual features.

34,"The PASTEUR4OA project analyses what makes an Open Access (OA) policy effective. The total number of institutional or funder OA policies worldwide is now 663 (March 2015), over half of them mandatory. ROARMAP, the policy registry, has been rebuilt to record more policy detail and provide more extensive search functionality. Deposit rates were measured for articles in institutions' repositories and compared to the total number of WoS-indexed articles published from those institutions. Average deposit rate was over four times as high for institutions with a mandatory policy. Six positive correlations were found between deposit rates and (1) Must-Deposit; (2) Cannot-Waive-Deposit; (3) Deposit-Linked-to-Research-Evaluation; (4) Cannot-Waive-Rights-Retention; (5) Must-Make-Deposit-OA (after allowable embargo) and (6) Can-Waive-OA. For deposit latency, there is a positive correlation between earlier deposit and (7) Must-Deposit-Immediately as well as with (4) Cannot-Waive-Rights-Retention and with mandate age. There are not yet enough OA policies to test whether still further policy conditions would contribute to mandate effectiveness but the present findings already suggest that it would be useful for current and future OA policies to adopt the seven positive conditions so as to accelerate and maximise the growth of OA.","Swan, A.;Gargouri, Y.;Hunt, M.;Harnad, S.",ArXiv e-prints,X000789272;X00bd80b2c;X01a466841;X035b7ee6c;X0428233f4;X056bf9c4f;X05a8a5d10;X05fa3710c;X06343febb;X072de23a0;X07f482b83;X081ed02c9;X08595a2a3;X08757564a;X08bfbf4b8;X09a018eb4;X0a31fdf09;X0bb577a13;X0c7471920;X0c88c48d7;X0d7e983ab;X0dc2b3e07;X0dec4dc21;X0eed27872;X10d95aa8b;X1164bacd6;X1245c23bf;X1336cf703;X133d66954;X138aab375;X13d1c1371;X13f6eef62;X1409e34a9;X156700c88;X15be58187;X15f0c021a;X162d362a0;X16459fa54;X1671df97f;X1691fdff6;X172add237;X17e3cf7b3;X181e7eca8;X185381ea5;X18a9fec45;X18b264562;X18c72c0d4;X18d8fbf1f;X1949ad12f;X19d997d3f;X1a5476700;X1aeb06f62;X1b7bc1557;X1be0cf804;X1d14f5de2;X1d2d82e2d;X1d454ae6d;X1d54b1b92;X1dab3ae79;X1dc00ef9c;X1ddd94d14;X1f19702fa;X1fbdacae4;X1fef833bf;X20370c303;X210d4914c;X21cd19d88;X2281b2df8;X23945dec0;X23e409306;X248478b73;X268541f55;X277c69846;X292be3397;X29d6c83e8;X2a5097403;X2a7ade999;X2a8da5e12;X2b4e9f447;X2b70e1bf4;X2c0c74f57;X2cf0d2aac;X2ec895505;X2f30cf848;X301500b89;X3081de650;X30e6dd0e4;X30e776bf8;X315c8fff3;X32fb82932;X338404f4d;X3396d6307;X34110efab;X38411e57a;X3b8f2a358;X3d4cb8c53;X3e74fb7ef;X3ead65e0d;X3ebcfd567;X40cb2ada9;X4248f47dd;X4383c6832;X4397f3fd9;X455e85347;X4820acd91;X48bbf2b69;X48d157d5d;X49d81a303;X49f3db7b2;X4a53bce20;X4b6476189;X4b6e0384f;X4b906d55f;X4ce718d76;X4dc70a454;X4efef8bc3;X5095ef3e9;X51865d4ab;X53ee634f6;X571bf46ee;X584af097b;X585fd6173;X59127b61f;X5a219fc65;X5a51ba639;X5a9e93ed4;X5cacc23cf;X5cb802067;X5cbdeb77b;X5e908a447;X6049026c5;X607a42853;X62cc0d22e;X640aaf5e7;X64609428c;X654c9942b;X662a372bf;X66d572f44;X67140e9ab;X67917f309;X693a48449;X6965f2cf9;X696dc0078;X6a31d5dde;X6a5f4663f;X6bdbbc681;X6d8ac597d;X6ddedbe69;X6f8a207d9;X6fa601c33;X6fdd9a8fe;X701f08843;X704d1fddb;X721bdd6fc;X729c9f09a;X72e0ef488;X731f0f864;X732d721c2;X73f8aa9f6;X7549a6735;X7594146b9;X75b22ce86;X75baaf6ac;X7813dd121;X79c679555;X79fface2c;X7a526e6c6;X7d5117b0f;X7e709bcb3;X7f4011c2c;X802a37600;X80f3eef14;X822fd5127;X82690b573;X82b0904d4;X834111348;X83943ea24;X848374171;X84b2d0bf7;X875783253;X88fbf066b;X89c96b47b;X8a164a443;X8bc67cba7;X8d6411433;X8d6445159;X8da31b1ba;X8e782d681;X8eb0b0c33;X8ebf30a8a;X8fc612343;X900d8e496;X90dd07739;X9107bf61c;X914c6ad1e;X92e763781;X92fbbc550;X93c7df791;X954409ae7;X957e3bbb5;X968626496;X97114c668;X97506b880;X9751c154a;X97a291a67;X9a4109130;X9c322688e;X9c4449f74;X9d02aaa76;X9e0a9514d;X9e6d6ef97;X9fafb6ed6;X9ff0a4a55;Xa16bc76a1;Xa1ded0245;Xa30230692;Xa37a130bc;Xa39981b5d;Xa4cf66ad0;Xa530f9c33;Xa79f828a9;Xa814da6a9;Xaa0459310;Xab20fdf26;Xac380f495;Xacc9251f2;Xadadce91f;Xb0cfeefb0;Xb23a782a0;Xb293e2340;Xb4ab87856;Xb4df3e075;Xb549fa442;Xb5a707267;Xb5beb5d8c;Xb76ecd4c6;Xb831b7bce;Xb9616b120;Xba90bc906;Xbbf924606;Xc01213e6e;Xc03e78a43;Xc1b1c30c3;Xc209909d4;Xc21ec7def;Xc33cc3b80;Xc5a7b6608;Xc6b8fa295;Xc76cb9870;Xc7b769fad;Xc9117f3e6;Xc951e17c2;Xc9b524daf;Xcaa451460;Xcac05b8e2;Xcc90235f7;Xccaf045da;Xccca21002;Xcdc6dcb33;Xceb69c0f0;Xcf000300c;Xcf17b9f95;Xcf921be27;Xd03107ac5;Xd0a69351e;Xd0c88690d;Xd1882b360;Xd1909851a;Xd279683f6;Xd2e37d040;Xd361a1062;Xd40c87b37;Xd46a71cd4;Xd524a8391;Xd63489833;Xd652b99f7;Xd673c43cd;Xd6cc49119;Xd970836ab;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdaf0bcadb;Xdccf9b140;Xde2d17c4a;Xde5c6db17;Xdf6bb162b;Xdfe4a29ad;Xe08a489bd;Xe1b1c61e7;Xe294b4bec;Xe3003f4bc;Xe3ffebeec;Xe4d042885;Xe55a231ea;Xe5c2bd9ff;Xe6c4b194c;Xe6e1d7682;Xeaa342fc4;Xeaf3974e5;Xeb85f2dc7;Xee6918665;Xf35a91f33;Xf40d2a26b;Xf42345752;Xf45f7ec2f;Xf5ac17cbc;Xf62d26d10;Xf7626990a;Xf80081864;Xf8d028f2b;Xf8fb72f9d;Xf959e818c;Xfb8efae39;Xfb8f85dce;Xfb8fffc48;Xfc06cb359;Xfde15e014;Xfe0c4c1af;Xffa6865bb,318,"Open Access Policy: Numbers, Analysis, Effectiveness",http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02261,2015
35,"As a follow-up to the highly-cited authors list published by Thomson Reuters in June 2014, we analyze the top-1% most frequently cited papers published between 2002 and 2012 included in the Web of Science (WoS) subject category ""Information Science & Library Science."" 798 authors contributed to 305 top-1% publications; these authors were employed at 275 institutions. The authors at Harvard University contributed the largest number of papers, when the addresses are whole-number counted. However, Leiden University leads the ranking, if fractional counting is used. Twenty-three of the 798 authors were also listed as most highly-cited authors by Thomson Reuters in June 2014 (http://highlycited.com/). Twelve of these 23 authors were involved in publishing four or more of the 305 papers under study. Analysis of co-authorship relations among the 798 highly-cited scientists shows that co-authorships are based on common interests in a specific topic. Three topics were important between 2002 and 2012: (1) collection and exploitation of information in clinical practices, (2) the use of internet in public communication and commerce, and (3) scientometrics.","Bauer, Johann;Leydesdorff, Loet;Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,550e6ff01f;552fa2702c;X00cee5edc;X01460a1c7;X041508751;X0482c0dd8;X050ea014e;X058e58819;X05a8a5d10;X08546c909;X08595a2a3;X0a31fdf09;X0ca3a5c09;X0da4af694;X0dd8b13a3;X0dec4dc21;X0e1e03064;X1058f1deb;X10b0b1669;X12d62b95e;X141123d2a;X15b4a02f3;X16c179d20;X17ed92288;X17ef984f0;X1882ec132;X188cfb643;X18d8fbf1f;X18e62fbf2;X19d161498;X1a1afd03f;X1aeb06f62;X1ca0afe4b;X1d2d82e2d;X1fce3e598;X20c5bc97d;X2295c20c3;X2368a345e;X238e37a3e;X24c8ae405;X2515a54f2;X2916cb14e;X299c45a26;X2af0a8b8e;X2b70e1bf4;X2cf0d2aac;X2dcc8e356;X2ef8a4546;X2f129858d;X301a1261e;X3169ced1b;X31cf4f354;X34c00b646;X38d2634ec;X39acf7a59;X3aa9c53b1;X3b163ae73;X3d65c9a09;X3d81f51c7;X3f1f569a5;X3f6e530d7;X403513c65;X4248f47dd;X4289968c4;X44ff22df6;X46a4ac290;X46c39dcee;X46de5627c;X47d7ea946;X47e69cbfb;X4b11b5515;X4b6e0384f;X4caeadbfa;X4d10d5ce3;X4d958f7af;X4e1809577;X5095ef3e9;X50eb35481;X51401aaa1;X51d210228;X54d02c49c;X55267c1ed;X55b0f9a42;X57266ab5d;X57d30f73a;X57f9d284a;X5a51ba639;X5a7d5aeba;X5ac2dc74f;X5c128a5bc;X5cb802067;X5efb3d458;X5f0996dc5;X5f537eb40;X62bee4fdf;X62ce6a1f9;X664ea2547;X66a4accbd;X6879f4c32;X693990f57;X69862c9d1;X6a72e6117;X6c9f23fc0;X6e2f2a049;X6f1a96d52;X6f8a207d9;X701f08843;X70f5e4c92;X722cb4828;X727f0227d;X729c9f09a;X75319ba5d;X770a45bf9;X777d9b03c;X78b6b2247;X78dca00ea;X79dc45be0;X7bb645111;X7f2482527;X804c5d6aa;X806fce26b;X82690b573;X831d23d51;X846d158d4;X8567efd8d;X86f71d748;X874967f5f;X8bb7f8832;X8bc67cba7;X8bd91fe4b;X8dd595d9f;X8e7ab2761;X8ec6c6a36;X91b908b8f;X929c8e568;X92a2940f4;X94d96f35a;X954409ae7;X9718b8350;X9751c154a;X9844c4c74;X99cbd7592;X99f92d5a0;X9b59e76c2;X9c6db04f4;X9d1be04b9;X9f1e7dc36;Xa0f847f3a;Xa30230692;Xa671d06c8;Xa7163075d;Xa971dbb69;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xaa894c2f0;Xaab1b7f5f;Xab18a8335;Xacc9251f2;Xae64c797e;Xb01c5f716;Xb1f897803;Xb205a2d5e;Xb207c6ed4;Xb2992911d;Xb2e39ca4f;Xb3d31f5ef;Xb415a8bf6;Xb4b13803b;Xb5539d1c2;Xb56db48f0;Xb63e4e72e;Xb75122ef5;Xb76580b1f;Xb76ecd4c6;Xb8d73401f;Xba4baf942;Xbb1df2e23;Xbde2153e9;Xbea53364e;Xbeed5b213;Xc01213e6e;Xc369f5355;Xc37affc71;Xc44166207;Xc4b574613;Xc4ffa59ab;Xc6b3bf9a8;Xc707b8d92;Xc7a4e284c;Xc7a6750e7;Xc8ec41f72;Xc9f93d146;Xcab254363;Xcb48dd98d;Xcc111dafc;Xcce62715c;Xcd2e5519c;Xd07959453;Xd0b9a17d9;Xd661bd77a;Xd6d421e9f;Xd7d3213d0;Xd8b8f235f;Xd98b134a2;Xd9c69cbc0;Xd9f50e665;Xda81f5cd0;Xdae27e595;Xdb350f703;Xdc262ae84;Xdc48db3dc;Xdd9c7f10f;Xdf226d1eb;Xdf2c9211c;Xdf796667a;Xe19540343;Xe1fccedc7;Xe27ff564d;Xe412d4381;Xe51e85453;Xe6abc9196;Xe6e34b84b;Xe7756b1f3;Xe7aeeb2bc;Xe93430d99;Xeddf14346;Xf0e6aa483;Xf11ddb8da;Xf1ddb9ba4;Xf253f8370;Xf263014f5;Xf35508cd0;Xf4251decc;Xf4799c5a3;Xf48095d71;Xf6c674337;Xf7256e68e;Xf81fc0084;Xf836c9f31;Xf8b755325;Xf9dcc20db;Xfa6e92685;Xfb3adf995;Xfde15e014,243,"Highly-cited papers in Library and Information Science (LIS): Authors, institutions, and network structures",http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02576,2015
36,"One is inclined to conceptualize impact in terms of citations per publication, and thus as an average. However, citation distributions are skewed, and the average has the disadvantage that the number of publications is used in the denominator. Using hundred percentiles, one can integrate the normalized citation curve and develop an indicator that can be compared across document sets because percentile ranks are defined at the article level. I apply this indicator to the set of 58 journals in the ISI Subject Category of ""Nanoscience & nanotechnology,"" and rank journals, countries, cities, and institutes using non-parametric statistics. The significance levels of results can thus be indicated. The results are first compared with the ISI-Impact Factors, but this Integrated Impact Indicator (I3) can be used with any set downloaded from the (Social) Science Citation Index.

37,"This paper builds on an innovative Information Retrieval tool, Ariadne. The tool has been developed as an interactive network visualization and browsing tool for large-scale bibliographic databases. It basically allows to gain insights into a topic by contextualizing a search query (Koopman et al., 2015). In this paper, we apply the Ariadne tool to a far smaller dataset of 111,616 documents in astronomy and astrophysics. Labeled as the Berlin dataset, this data have been used by several research teams to apply and later compare different clustering algorithms. The quest for this team effort is how to delineate topics. This paper contributes to this challenge in two different ways. First, we produce one of the different cluster solution and second, we use Ariadne (the method behind it, and the interface - called LittleAriadne) to display cluster solutions of the different group members. By providing a tool that allows the visual inspection of the similarity of article clusters produced by different algorithms, we present a complementary approach to other possible means of comparison. More particular, we discuss how we can - with LittleAriadne - browse through the network of topical terms, authors, journals and cluster solutions in the Berlin dataset and compare cluster solutions as well as see their context.","Koopman, Rob;Wang, Shenghui;Scharnhorst, Andrea",ArXiv e-prints,553b46236d;X007a3f654;X054ed7f1f;X056bf9c4f;X0970e0b3f;X0b51ecf87;X0cf2ed3d3;X0f7ae5d0e;X10ed4f308;X15f0c021a;X1639b05e5;X1aeb06f62;X1bd7b3769;X200e79523;X231a17150;X248478b73;X26e9e5a9e;X2916cb14e;X2d5ac6208;X34ec3a42b;X350e457c7;X35485d2eb;X3943ee59d;X3fcf291f2;X45585c072;X46de5627c;X47414da64;X475ed5f36;X4831401dd;X4e8a95c1d;X4fdfcfe98;X571e3a56f;X5a3349ad3;X5db747f61;X5f3da438b;X60ea62974;X65c200ed8;X65eeec816;X674531e05;X6c17a21fa;X6cf3ba513;X70957f7dc;X70b2c6e4a;X71490e16e;X764a34f7b;X76eca206c;X7813dd121;X78b776ffb;X78dca00ea;X79da1b35f;X7a947097a;X7c9f26459;X7d872b935;X82b97e84b;X8bc67cba7;X904afb53f;X917a84a13;X934a6b623;X93a1b0dd5;X93d446d43;X93f32a0f8;X96bf8020d;X9717a3f07;X9751c154a;X997e03c0f;X9c4449f74;X9c46fdb05;X9c6db04f4;X9d96e0a6c;X9ddb45e1a;Xa1baae54b;Xa4e8fb350;Xa8492823d;Xa8d566f83;Xab55802ad;Xacca41cd7;Xacdc00b29;Xad6ff2964;Xada2affc9;Xb62c33b60;Xb63e4e72e;Xb7b920db6;Xb8fba05e5;Xbb46806f7;Xbb9478e8c;Xc01213e6e;Xcab254363;Xcbc150818;Xcdad44d18;Xceb69c0f0;Xd0b9a17d9;Xd1dc01b47;Xd3bb7463e;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdf2c9211c;Xe15a444a4;Xe203c02be;Xe785ee708;Xe81f8af08;Xe98e1c922;Xea1734bae;Xee733f8f6;Xefd219ebb;Xf04e658c5;Xf5219667f;Xfac572614;Xfde15e014,107,"Contextualization of topics - browsing through terms, authors, journals and cluster allocations",http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04208,2015

In this paper, a simple model based on the assumption of an unvarying ""author ability"" is introduced.

41,"Socio-cognitive action reproduces and changes both social and cognitive structures. The analytical distinction between these dimensions of structure provides us with richer models of scientific development. In this study, I assume that (i) social structures organize expectations into belief structures that can be attributed to individuals and communities; (ii) expectations are specified in scholarly literature; and (iii) intellectually the sciences (disciplines, specialties) tend to self-organize as systems of rationalized expectations. Whereas social organizations remain localized, academic writings can circulate, and expectations can be stabilized and globalized using symbolically generalized codes of communication. The intellectual restructuring, however, remains latent as a second-order dynamics that can be accessed by participants only reflexively. Yet, the emerging ""horizons of meaning"" provide feedback to the historically developing organizations by constraining the possible future states as boundary conditions. I propose to model these possible future states using incursive and hyper-incursive equations from the computation of anticipatory systems. Simulations of these equations enable us to visualize the couplings among the historical--i.e., recursive--progression of social structures along trajectories, the evolutionary--i.e., hyper-incursive--development of systems of expectations at the regime level, and the incursive instantiations of expectations in actions, organizations, and texts.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,550e6ff01f;X004b49388;X013c4c0e7;X02826b959;X03f1539eb;X04db9b81f;X05a8a5d10;X0654b4ce7;X08a9f0639;X09fa667d9;X0b8e43ee0;X0c2623760;X0cf2ed3d3;X0d73721f4;X0db138e8f;X0de9bf396;X0e8aeae92;X0eb2709c6;X102769245;X1058f1deb;X12a9411ab;X14008bb71;X1529b21b5;X17e15e9c8;X1882ec132;X18f8f0af6;X1aeb06f62;X1bd7b3769;X1c141fab0;X1e59e809d;X1eec07bdf;X204e25360;X20cd13e65;X210aed27c;X2147aa6e2;X22833d74c;X23e8600dd;X24b98b865;X261440770;X28e38c112;X2a433afc8;X2a5097403;X2af0a8b8e;X2ba0c7cad;X2cb99fc09;X2d80f1414;X2e884a974;X2f0a51a0a;X2fcf8b386;X3058328dd;X322dd8378;X32ee63179;X33dcbb025;X393604e08;X397546b2d;X39daebaaa;X39e87e148;X3b2e894f4;X3ebb18fd8;X3f2eb98d1;X3fe512e70;X420080feb;X447a9cff1;X45877e8c1;X45f5c7931;X46de5627c;X47d7ea946;X48ad0e866;X4a541115e;X4b59edbe5;X4c98a95d8;X505cf3d06;X50e1ee3e5;X56f530600;X58e80e8c7;X59a18fce7;X5a3f0d412;X5db747f61;X5e8972cdd;X5f7c0e101;X612ada3af;X6151bc8d3;X61b3592fb;X61bc534da;X635c1475d;X644282b2e;X644f6cc37;X6534326e0;X664ea2547;X66f8c77b6;X670dcdcaa;X68db96647;X69a78f128;X6a98b2ba3;X6be66196f;X6d07ddd1d;X6d6fc2c93;X6fd186fd3;X70957f7dc;X723995795;X72aaca9b1;X730438408;X738815705;X73d079159;X76b1fe8dd;X77535ce34;X777d9b03c;X77a308759;X78b69fdbc;X78dca00ea;X7a7af8613;X7a947097a;X7aa781525;X7af10de96;X7b8722eb1;X7bcb4f955;X7f223a538;X7f25e4b47;X809601670;X80bfdcbb8;X812bc3182;X82d26ae85;X83d97f580;X859b1c48b;X875783253;X87c46fcc5;X882ee801a;X883c4ce1d;X885b519e0;X897dc7abd;X8a4360422;X8bf74aeba;X8c881c351;X8e3d0dea0;X8e5963498;X8f6d36b6e;X90add2685;X930544021;X933a1f441;X994fcad80;X99ae38cd1;X99db4eb48;X99df42d1b;X99fa40989;X9a36425c4;X9b3d7b5da;X9bd4f144f;X9d2e93447;X9dbdc6cab;Xa1cba523f;Xa3036670a;Xa530f9c33;Xa57ce19a8;Xa58c36aeb;Xa684bdaf1;Xa6bf33243;Xa8fd41c63;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xaa1d53a8b;Xab18a8335;Xab55802ad;Xac3ba38d8;Xad5bcdf18;Xae9523826;Xaf65a4466;Xb0cf97822;Xb149467f0;Xb207c6ed4;Xb243953c9;Xb36949e9b;Xb36bf6d7a;Xb50e05f0b;Xb7b920db6;Xb845af8c8;Xb86bdf63c;Xb9fbed9cb;Xbae3dea72;Xbc211a2a6;Xbc5dbecc8;Xbd25d073f;Xbd63b298f;Xbd74722d2;Xbf2c4f712;Xc01213e6e;Xc64232ed5;Xc72638249;Xca6cf81f3;Xcf20ed3e1;Xd00ddc803;Xd0bf69e26;Xd0c341a2e;Xd1f30b564;Xd20c02f1f;Xd67df1a40;Xd6bf49aeb;Xd72a5787b;Xd7cc59201;Xd9c69cbc0;Xd9f19d744;Xdc4dca7f9;Xdcbb97191;Xdd6fc26a6;Xde323ab46;Xdf2ac53aa;Xdf2c9211c;Xdf3b690b6;Xdf58a53b5;Xe0a4117ac;Xe1fccedc7;Xe305388bc;Xe32f42aa0;Xe4c4a2357;Xe63bac597;Xe67270f43;Xe75e6cbc0;Xe76f69748;Xe85c6cb6a;Xe8ca03459;Xeb078907a;Xeba92f260;Xec816f644;Xed5283e81;Xed933f01c;Xef05876d2;Xf2f762068;Xf362bbaa0;Xf37452ccc;Xf3a6c32ff;Xf6aa43fc4;Xfc06cb359;Xfc134838d;Xfdd981b90,232,Can the Intellectual Processes in Science Also Be Simulated?

As a use case, an empirical study is presented into the discovery of a long-standing complex, interdisciplinary discourse, the debate on the species concept in biosystematics.","Soos, Sandor",ArXiv e-prints,X05f3483e7;X0cc527336;X0ead9f8d2;X117960dba;X1aeb06f62;X1bd7b3769;X29481c6a0;X36fb97a09;X393604e08;X3c96b146b;X3fcf291f2;X4231e35e6;X436d765c7;X46de5627c;X4a7b374cf;X57228d55f;X59d826c88;X5de5418c5;X621b0373a;X678b7ff38;X6a5f4663f;X71b4a308c;X735e5b93b;X74013eb80;X7432af34f;X784f378cf;X78dca00ea;X7f25e4b47;X82690b573;X934a6b623;X9a4109130;X9c8eee6c3;Xa0c327b3d;Xa684bdaf1;Xabab93cd6;Xad6cd5692;Xb25bdb72e;Xb2c042a51;Xce22640f8;Xd0c341a2e;Xd58dc518b;Xd58f97252;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdb8a9ff4b;Xdf2c9211c;Xe15aeb7c6;Xe7a3ef31d;Xf64a847a1;Xf9f402284;Xff36055fe,50,A new generation of science overlay maps with an application to the history of biosystematics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05816,2015
47,"Two methods for extracting detailed formal dependencies from the Coq and Mizar system are presented and compared. The methods are used for dependency extraction from two large mathematical repositories: the Coq Repository at Nijmegen and the Mizar Mathematical Library.

48,"In a ""publish-or-perish culture"", the ranking of scientific journals plays a central role in assessing performance in the current research environment. With a wide range of existing methods and approaches to deriving journal rankings, meta-rankings have gained popularity as a means of aggregating different information sources. In this paper, we propose a method to create a consensus meta-ranking using heterogeneous journal rankings. Using a parametric model for paired comparison data we estimate quality scores for 58 journals in the OR/MS community, which together with a shrinkage procedure allows for the identification of clusters of journals with similar quality. The use of paired comparisons provides a flexible framework for deriving a consensus score while eliminating the problem of data missingness.","Vana, Laura;Hochreiter, Ronald;Hornik, Kurt",ArXiv e-prints,5542dabebf;X0a31fdf09;X0db138e8f;X0e24210ee;X153ae1650;X178acc0e6;X1aeb06f62;X1b96d97e8;X1bd7b3769;X1c01e9c9a;X1d976c336;X210aed27c;X214ee7847;X27f253196;X2d3bdab40;X2d5ac6208;X34a876ced;X36fb97a09;X37fe48d5f;X38093820e;X3b6c4e2be;X3e74fb7ef;X4008ec009;X423e14cbd;X436d765c7;X4a11ad433;X4a541115e;X4def7017e;X4e8eb516d;X57228d55f;X57278d530;X57943b6f4;X59de65f8c;X5db747f61;X5de5418c5;X5fde67625;X6534326e0;X6819e21d3;X6fec6d2d0;X705a9f5dd;X70b6c6a36;X710f9f040;X78dca00ea;X7a947097a;X7af10de96;X7e97daf80;X809601670;X882ee801a;X8e3c23921;X90add2685;X914c6ad1e;X943d5be1a;X961bb3d7a;X9b3d7b5da;X9b75c5a8e;Xa071b47fa;Xa21d6fa09;Xa2224b2a6;Xa273c05d5;Xa33e8819d;Xa4e3e20d0;Xa530f9c33;Xa684bdaf1;Xa742c3f97;Xa83b32f2c;Xab55802ad;Xac4933ab7;Xad6cd5692;Xb7a461c08;Xb8fbc58cd;Xbfe8fe23d;Xc01213e6e;Xca6cf81f3;Xccbad6f52;Xcd91796db;Xd422b57dc;Xd909560bb;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdcee7162c;Xdd6fc26a6;Xde257a1ce;Xde323ab46;Xdf5a1bfff;Xe12444b62;Xe12ef9d15;Xe2b11ce30;Xe31ced677;Xe6c5caa94;Xeba92f260;Xee7df7f8d;Xf0626958d;Xf103cd3cb;Xf4799c5a3;Xf556be073;Xf64997185,95,Computing a consensus journal meta-ranking using paired comparisons and adaptive lasso estimators,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04873,2015
49,"Dyads of journals related by citations can agglomerate into specialties through the mechanism of triadic closure. Using the Journal Citation Reports 2011, 2012, and 2013, we analyze triad formation as indicators of integration (specialty growth) and disintegration (restructuring). The strongest integration is found among the large journals that report on studies in different scientific specialties, such as PLoS ONE, Nature Communications, Nature, and Science. This tendency towards large-scale integration has not yet stabilized. Using the Islands algorithm, we also distinguish 51 local maxima of integration. We zoom into the cited articles that carry the integration for: (i) a new development within high-energy physics and (ii) an emerging interface between the journals Applied Mathematical Modeling and the International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology. In the first case, integration is brought about by a specific communication reaching across specialty boundaries, whereas in the second, the dyad of journals indicates an emerging interface between specialties. These results suggest that integration picks up substantive developments at the specialty level. An advantage of the bottom-up method is that no ex ante classification of journals is assumed in the dynamic analysis.","de Nooy, Wouter;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,550e6ff01f;5545414f48;X05f3483e7;X0b24e6167;X0cc527336;X10ef91d57;X117960dba;X12d62b95e;X1aeb06f62;X1bd7b3769;X1deb0443b;X2559565ac;X27c66b668;X29481c6a0;X2af0a8b8e;X393604e08;X3c7934146;X3ebcfd567;X4231e35e6;X4316195cf;X4a7b374cf;X4c375422f;X59d826c88;X59de65f8c;X621b0373a;X670dcdcaa;X678b7ff38;X6c9f23fc0;X6e22c0376;X71b4a308c;X74013eb80;X7432af34f;X7ad79e4c0;X7be1c4aac;X8a469cb39;X8f301427d;X90dd07739;X92642d1cd;X934a6b623;X945d5fcbd;X94b3331f8;X98fb82851;X9c8eee6c3;X9e55b2a52;Xa55b471f2;Xa647cf518;Xa684bdaf1;Xaab1b7f5f;Xab18a8335;Xabab93cd6;Xacd45b98b;Xb170befbd;Xb207c6ed4;Xb2c042a51;Xb60e330fe;Xb86bdf63c;Xc34c4fc55;Xc4b574613;Xce1a4b4c0;Xce22640f8;Xd162543c2;Xd27d91dae;Xd58dc518b;Xd58f97252;Xd9c69cbc0;Xe0dbde448;Xe19540343;Xe4dd565ce;Xe51e869bc;Xe6d5e5d12;Xeb5bcb334;Xf0a24eb62;Xf472965fd;Xfe369fb3c;Xfee2f31ac,75,The Dynamics of Triads in Aggregated Journal-Journal Citation Relations: Specialty Developments at the Above-Journal Level,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05840,2015
50,"The peer-review process is the most widely accepted certification mechanism for officially accepting the written results of researchers within the scientific community. An essential component of peer-review is the identification of competent referees to review a submitted manuscript. This article presents an algorithm to automatically determine the most appropriate reviewers for a manuscript by way of a co-authorship network data structure and a relative-rank particle-swarm algorithm. This approach is novel in that it is not limited to a pre-selected set of referees, is computationally efficient, requires no human-intervention, and, in some instances, can automatically identify conflict of interest situations. A useful application of this algorithm would be to open commentary peer-review systems because it provides a weighting for each referee with respects to their expertise in the domain of a manuscript. The algorithm is validated using referee bid data from the 2005 Joint Conference on Digital Libraries.","Rodriguez, Marko A.;Bollen, Johan",ArXiv e-prints,X214f71f63;X3a67a193b;X3ba3df9fe;X41059ed72;X4c8b99dfc;X65afa0b43;X72d97c4e4;X9a9edeeca;Xb7f0f7599;Xf3d4a9195;Xf9a37d050,11,An Algorithm to Determine Peer-Reviewers,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605112,2006

This paper presents a technical, standards-based architecture for sharing usage information, which we have designed and implemented. In this architecture, OpenURL-compliant linking servers aggregate usage information of a specific user community as it navigates the distributed information environment that it has access to. This usage information is made OAI-PMH harvestable so that usage information exposed by many linking servers can be aggregated to facilitate the creation of value-added services with a reach beyond that of a single community or a single information service. This paper also discusses issues that were encountered when implementing the proposed approach, and it presents preliminary results obtained from analyzing a usage data set containing about 3,500,000 requests aggregated by a federation of linking servers at the California State University system over a 20 month period.","Bollen, Johan;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X0446777c6;X187f0b6a9;X22c35a86f;X24fc690ce;X56c421749;X6e3922228;X6e6716125;X89a199d97;X93ee22640;X993622ed7;Xab6148654;Xc0fb04d69;Xecff28a43;Xf0b346452;Xf0f347e95,15,An Architecture for the Aggregation and Analysis of Scholarly Usage Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605113,2006

54,"Lawrence (2001)found computer science articles that were openly accessible (OA) on the Web were cited more. We replicated this in physics. We tested 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias = 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5%-16% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p 〈 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r 〉 .90, N=12, p 〈 .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p 〈 .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA). Further research will analyze the effect's timing, causal components and relation to other variables.","Hajjem, C.;Harnad, S.;Gingras, Y.",ArXiv e-prints,X050a580d1;X052c93ab7;X077a48f95;X083099241;X09309c56a;X0c2623760;X0c55de574;X1555774d2;X162ce4322;X19095deb6;X1949cd3da;X1c6d192de;X1e66b2f9c;X203af7720;X221bf1410;X237a9bf64;X24c06f77f;X25c40889a;X266f990b2;X26e44fc2c;X28e1156bc;X2c670b398;X2f1d9bbd1;X2f6daca53;X308851f76;X326b4df0a;X331398602;X33de1b262;X37714ea29;X37a533fc1;X38026e074;X3855ba75e;X3956199fa;X39ff18e7d;X3d78c5d18;X3dcb38582;X3ebb18fd8;X401a0f473;X42eb472c2;X4809ee90a;X4c13a7d1c;X4c48c6c54;X4ebbb5420;X508c2c636;X536a1d43e;X58521cd16;X5aef82973;X5df8ac142;X5f636d073;X61553a3c8;X61d144b84;X6352f17b8;X637adc202;X64bd81576;X66860dd23;X66b175c58;X67cfc0323;X6c700bac2;X6e82d09d2;X71536c4c6;X716321af7;X735b3741d;X779beedd0;X7910ef9af;X7b116c5e4;X7bd5fbc90;X7c537ffb0;X7cfe4dcd7;X7d33ffa7a;X7f4050ffa;X80ce6e9af;X838b087ff;X84b1f2b0a;X84b2c45bd;X8a29fc85f;X8aa8fe1bc;X8c3a2176a;X90606b491;X90cf06007;X9321f4c91;X94004101d;X9499867bd;X94be31848;X952888f8f;X9bdcd52b4;Xa986ddbdd;Xab9c52ede;Xabd4a73de;Xad1ef1ec5;Xad6653a8d;Xad807a789;Xae64c797e;Xb0229b37a;Xb04640837;Xb0c2f3246;Xb1867efc7;Xb6ceee4fc;Xb937e34ff;Xb94435a65;Xba050ea79;Xbaf5f5b21;Xbbb584f8c;Xc20949f9f;Xc47a2be9f;Xc4b873545;Xc62acbcb5;Xc7315950a;Xc824ac76e;Xc83466c8e;Xca818b8f4;Xcaea23872;Xd0341986a;Xd081fcaef;Xd329d1902;Xd3a599fde;Xd4353521b;Xd4db980cd;Xdbf3fd191;Xdd3138324;Xde4a9b3a0;Xdf3298a82;Xe08a489bd;Xe46189c31;Xe528afac6;Xe87ccb8e5;Xeba8c85fb;Xec6e51643;Xed5534533;Xee83635ba;Xf00a89e1e;Xf13c2cf20;Xf2694bb7f;Xf30ecf01c;Xf399419eb;Xf55cefcd5;Xff1af45a1,136,Ten-Year Cross-Disciplinary Comparison of the Growth of Open Access and How it Increases Research Citation Impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0606079,2006
55,"What is the value of a scientist and its impact upon the scientific thinking? How can we measure the prestige of a journal or of a conference? The evaluation of the scientific work of a scientist and the estimation of the quality of a journal or conference has long attracted significant interest, due to the benefits from obtaining an unbiased and fair criterion. Although it appears to be simple, defining a quality metric is not an easy task. To overcome the disadvantages of the present metrics used for ranking scientists and journals, J.E. Hirsch proposed a pioneering metric, the now famous h-index. In this article, we demonstrate several inefficiencies of this index and develop a pair of generalizations and effective variants of it to deal with scientist ranking and with publication forum ranking. The new citation indices are able to disclose trendsetters in scientific research, as well as researchers that constantly shape their field with their influential work, no matter how old they are. We exhibit the effectiveness and the benefits of the new indices to unfold the full potential of the h-index, with extensive experimental results obtained from DBLP, a widely known on-line digital library.","Sidiropoulos, Antonis;Katsaros, Dimitrios;Manolopoulos, Yannis",ArXiv e-prints,X02d990681;X06d4e3293;X07c20c0b2;X0c969299c;X0ca931c47;X0ff7cbd03;X11556508c;X12c310dbb;X1709884e2;X1ca52e56a;X1fa567cea;X2196a6117;X2214cbc04;X246b3e7c4;X25e4c0fb0;X26309b655;X278497697;X27d2807d8;X2d0fe27a2;X2ef8a4546;X33e4743e0;X34dba27be;X35b039eff;X36a33d824;X39435c790;X3a3a80070;X3af5d01e2;X3b1f3a04e;X3da6d53b9;X3db6a29d2;X415c1e993;X43e952cd1;X453821169;X45bbab58c;X46ce907f1;X471cd1b1e;X4c9972f1d;X4e477c9aa;X4f25bf505;X4f5b9e48f;X4f7becd9d;X4ff79da36;X52c39c719;X5313244d2;X53efdbfe5;X559d08eb1;X5659549eb;X5a72e6a96;X5c90787c8;X5ef23b44d;X63b33c79d;X653c6824c;X656f3fcd7;X66860dd23;X670b9ffad;X67cf90146;X68fb2d898;X6e2f3ebb9;X70133249a;X72a2b326e;X72a606a6e;X740adfb79;X77f31a472;X7889ac8e5;X7ad79e4c0;X7b14b884e;X7c42e8ee0;X80806e381;X80874889c;X825908c6e;X851341b13;X860156a77;X87d93a576;X891943e90;X8ac257951;X8f0c16de5;X8fa203618;X909f9e4c8;X9112c064c;X93923a14e;X95aa79ea0;X983cd3c5c;X9ac3c6ae0;X9ded3826a;Xa198295e5;Xa28380133;Xa2e2d5852;Xa4cf8a453;Xa7a25f5ce;Xa7c6cca53;Xaa2050d2b;Xaa7784828;Xadd66b30a;Xb405ec81d;Xb51d10e66;Xb727932df;Xbcc0882ef;Xbd1fc0cf7;Xc1cbeea45;Xc2daf27f5;Xc3dc8b3f6;Xc43d8eb52;Xc9385d1a7;Xc9b4f0585;Xcb37e7bbd;Xcf6c1508f;Xcffc003b0;Xd24656868;Xd9b93ec00;Xd9fc3408f;Xe01f58456;Xe25f1af81;Xe75093074;Xe7802e1f6;Xeb9d8cac3;Xee3fdbbac;Xf0221e537;Xf368772e1;Xf4e925524;Xf53f9929c;Xfaefdfcec;Xfc3e5acab;Xfd7a17312;Xfe6616e33;Xff1e64015,125,Generalized h-index for Disclosing Latent Facts in Citation Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0607066,2006
56,"This paper describes the aDORe repository architecture, designed and implemented for ingesting, storing, and accessing a vast collection of Digital Objects at the Research Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aDORe architecture is highly modular and standards-based. In the architecture, the MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration Language is used as the XML-based format to represent Digital Objects that can consist of multiple datastreams as Open Archival Information System Archival Information Packages (OAIS AIPs).Through an ingestion process, these OAIS AIPs are stored in a multitude of autonomous repositories. A Repository Index keeps track of the creation and location of all the autonomous repositories, whereas an Identifier Locator registers in which autonomous repository a given Digital Object or OAIS AIP resides. A front-end to the complete environment, the OAI-PMH Federator, is introduced for requesting OAIS Dissemination Information Packages (OAIS DIPs). These OAIS DIPs can be the stored OAIS AIPs themselves, or transformations thereof. This front-end allows OAI-PMH harvesters to recurrently and selectively collect batches of OAIS DIPs from aDORe, and hence to create multiple, parallel services using the collected objects. Another front-end, the OpenURL Resolver, is introduced for requesting OAIS Result Sets. An OAIS Result Set is a dissemination of an individual Digital Object or of its constituent datastreams. Both front-ends make use of an MPEG-21 Digital Item Processing Engine to apply services to OAIS AIPs, Digital Objects, or constituent datastreams that were specified in a dissemination request.","Van de Sompel, Herbert;Bekaert, Jeroen;Liu, Xiaoming;Balakireva, Luda;Schwander, Thorsten",ArXiv e-prints,X2a7efa9c1;X67bc5167e;X6d11ae30c;X700cd4198;Xa4c00fe8d;Xadd66b30a;Xe36e5e5fb,7,"aDORe: a modular, standards-based Digital Object Repository",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0502028,2005
57,"The presented work proposes a novel approach to model the citation rate. The paper begins with a brief introduction into informetrics studies and highlights drawbacks of the contemporary approaches to modeling the citation process as a product of social interactions. An alternative modeling framework based on results obtained in cognitive psychology is then introduced and applied in an experiment to investigate properties of the citation process, as they are revealed by a large collection of citation statistics. Major research findings are discussed, and a summary is given.","Kryssanov, V. V.;Rinaldo, F.

As will be explained, a little extension of their examples just illustrate the opposite, a stable feature of the h-index. For starting authors it, the h-index that is, focusses on the number of articles; for experienced authors its focus shifts towards the citation scores. This feature may be liked or not but does not make the h-index an inconsistent and inappropriate indicator, as the authors claim.","Waaijers, Leo",ArXiv e-prints,,0,Viva the h-index,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.5520,2011
59,"I describe a method to separate the articles of different authors with the same name. It is based on a distance between any two publications, defined in terms of the probability that they would have as many coincidences if they were drawn at random from all published documents. Articles with a given author name are then clustered according to their distance, so that all articles in a cluster belong very likely to the same author. The method has proven very useful in generating groups of papers that are then selected manually. This simplifies considerably citation analysis when the author publication lists are not available.","Soler, Jose M.",ArXiv e-prints,X175ab68cb;X1eab5323b;X37f9a58bb;X76b2432b3;Xca719cf0a;Xd5f512827;Xeac2f9c20,7,Separating the articles of authors with the same name,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0608004,2006

To do this, they must attain high standards of usability over an extremely broad audience. This paper details the evolution of one important digital library component as it has grown in functionality and usefulness over several years of use by a live, unrestricted community. Central to its evolution have been user studies, analysis of use patterns, and formative usability evaluation.

63,"Are the e-prints (electronic preprints) from the arXiv repository being used instead of journal articles? We show that the e-prints have not undermined the usage of journal papers from the four core journals in astrophysics. As soon as the journal article is published, the astronomical community prefers to read it and the use of e-prints through the NASA Astrophysics Data System drops to zero. This suggests that most astronomers have access to institutional subscriptions and that they choose to read the journal article. In other words, the e-prints have not undermined journal use in this community and thus currently do not pose a financial threat to publishers. Furthermore, we show that the half-life (the point at which the use of an article drops to half the use of a newly published article) for an e-print is shorter than for a journal paper.","Henneken, Edwin A.;Kurtz, Michael J.;Eichhorn, Guenther;Accomazzi, Alberto;Grant, Carolyn S.;Thompson, Donna;Bohlen, Elizabeth;Murray, Stephen S.;Ginsparg, Paul;Warner, Simeon",Learned Publishing,54df5efe85;X07c20c0b2;X1d54a57b9;X2abb24e41;X3daa20c97;X4c1b6d5d2;X527d043c7;X54dbaa628;X5a066ed2c;X5d2f1264f;X6974142b8;X6ba3c6ebb;X74c43a30b;X7e545feba;X8249adb30;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X926f51ea9;X97da6a7fd;Xa23be7b19;Xb1875d7bd;Xb3e47aa3f;Xb6ca49dc9;Xb7968c783;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xcbdeb5a6e;Xd011d9c1b;Xe377cc1c9;Xe5283b6b2;Xf3b223276,31,E-prints and journal articles in astronomy: a productive co-existence,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0609126,2007

71,"Percentile-based approaches have been proposed as a non-parametric alternative to parametric central-tendency statistics to normalize observed citation counts. Percentiles are based on an ordered set of citation counts in a reference set, whereby the fraction of papers at or below the citation counts of a focal paper is used as an indicator for its relative citation impact in the set. In this study, we pursue two related objectives: (1) although different percentile-based approaches have been developed, an approach is hitherto missing that satisfies a number of criteria such as scaling of the percentile ranks from zero (all other papers perform better) to 100 (all other papers perform worse), and solving the problem with tied citation ranks unambiguously. We introduce a new citation-rank approach having these properties, namely P100. (2) We compare the reliability of P100 empirically with other percentile-based approaches, such as the approaches developed by the SCImago group, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), and Thomson Reuters (InCites), using all papers published in 1980 in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS). How accurately can the different approaches predict the long-term citation impact in 2010 (in year 31) using citation impact measured in previous time windows (years 1 to 30)? The comparison of the approaches shows that the method used by InCites overestimates citation impact (because of using the highest percentile rank when papers are assigned to more than a single subject category) whereas the SCImago indicator shows higher power in predicting the long-term citation impact on the basis of citation rates in early years. Since the results show a disadvantage in this predictive ability for P100 against the other approaches, there is still room for further improvements.","Bornmann, Lutz;Leydesdorff, Loet;Wang, Jian",ArXiv e-prints,54f8987905;X00645a85c;X0252a48cd;X04a7c0158;X09032806d;X18df2f942;X1cfbb02f0;X1d454ae6d;X20e094520;X25db0ffdc;X325e3eb3c;X378c31abe;X38662ba64;X450d36a11;X4638f1cc3;X472ef9c35;X4795144e3;X50f989929;X51ade55aa;X56f30aba8;X58b12fd58;X5a6005205;X5bc4827e8;X5c6b601e0;X65e3a0581;X7209b5584;X72a6db303;X7b5303a60;X7c242dc93;X7e4870678;X80bbd3caf;X818997476;X82887bdce;X85ed273f7;X86b5a878a;X9309fe6a5;X96f3637df;X9a5e4f439;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa2fda6ef1;Xa3fc83ead;Xa7fad295a;Xacf20c5d8;Xadc3b0a60;Xb0ec467b0;Xb333fa417;Xb7e2e5fcf;Xbbcc22a13;Xbc9d047b3;Xbe2e66a24;Xbf0fa4f73;Xc89c3ce36;Xcb13276dd;Xcc4f6b9ea;Xcc5a6aa63;Xcdc477e7d;Xd90a7ecd3;Xd9dfbb4ac;Xdac96e3c8;Xdc4c9aa66;Xdd1724c41;Xdf8d48149;Xe4bd59734;Xe9361fb12;Xf64618bd2;Xf90be6331;Xfd7a68290;Xff8e48686,68,Which percentile-based approach should be preferred for calculating normalized citation impact values?

We will use examples to show how MDF description makes use of combined strength of different description schemes to enhance its expression power and flexibility. We conclude the paper with discussion of using MDF description of a movie video to search/retrieve required scene clips from the movie, on the MDF prototype system we have implemented.","Hu, Michael J.;Jian, Ye",ArXiv e-prints,X00854b39f;X6c9861546;Xfba6c2a4b,3,Multimedia Description Framework (MDF) for Content Description of Audio/Video Documents,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902016,1999
74,"The ongoing paradigm change in the scholarly publication system ('science is turning to e-science') makes it necessary to construct alternative evaluation criteria/metrics which appropriately take into account the unique characteristics of electronic publications and other research output in digital formats. Today, major parts of scholarly Open Access (OA) publications and the self-archiving area are not well covered in the traditional citation and indexing databases. The growing share and importance of freely accessible research output demands new approaches/metrics for measuring and for evaluating of these new types of scientific publications. In this paper we propose a simple quantitative method which establishes indicators by measuring the access/download pattern of OA documents and other web entities of a single web server. The experimental indicators (search engine, backlink and direct access indicator) are constructed based on standard local web usage data. This new type of web-based indicator is developed to model the specific demand for better study/evaluation of the accessibility, visibility and interlinking of open accessible documents. We conclude that e-science will need new stable e-indicators.","Mayr, Philipp",,,0,Constructing experimental indicators for open access documents,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610056,2006
75,"There exist ample demonstrations that indicators of scholarly impact analogous to the citation-based ISI Impact Factor can be derived from usage data. However, contrary to the ISI IF which is based on citation data generated by the global community of scholarly authors, so far usage can only be practically recorded at a local level leading to community-specific assessments of scholarly impact that are difficult to generalize to the global scholarly community. We define a journal Usage Impact Factor which mimics the definition of the Thomson Scientific's ISI Impact Factor. Usage Impact Factor rankings are calculated on the basis of a large-scale usage data set recorded for the California State University system from 2003 to 2005. The resulting journal rankings are then compared to Thomson Scientific's ISI Impact Factor which is used as a baseline indicator of general impact. Our results indicate that impact as derived from California State University usage reflects the particular scientific and demographic characteristics of its communities.","Bollen, Johan;van de Sompel, Herbert",Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,X037e5cb54;X06a9fa8f9;X07c20c0b2;X11c9e62a9;X1329c9e05;X1d54a57b9;X1f0619d4c;X24760347a;X253b8bfd3;X2a95ad2fb;X2abb24e41;X2b59d1b72;X2bef89665;X3069483f5;X355a4b0cb;X36341eea3;X36ba15347;X37206498f;X373367a02;X3cdfc35de;X4c1b6d5d2;X527d043c7;X5c4d8ae3f;X5ccae28d6;X5d2f1264f;X5edf29907;X674fe9827;X6974142b8;X74c43a30b;X7632ed6b4;X794e81e49;X7c3db9c64;X802e2e32c;X81b6a84ea;X8249adb30;X82c37431b;X848bf8278;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X8c722a6eb;X967a7dbd2;X994520f58;X9a57fa96c;Xa071b47fa;Xa21a64ef0;Xa9574fc94;Xafc83bd12;Xb1875d7bd;Xba9e90876;Xbfa4a6e03;Xc0f461c6b;Xc2034ba28;Xcb09a5d57;Xd011d9c1b;Xdbf21f5b9;Xdc4af9347;Xe5283b6b2;Xec7123f26;Xf0028c1f0;Xf27c7bc22;Xf3b223276,61,Usage Impact Factor: The effects of sample characteristics on usage-based impact metrics,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610154,2008
76,"Cultural heritage documentation induces the use of computerized techniques to manage and preserve the information produced. Geographical information systems have proved their potentialities in this scope, but they are not always adapted for the management of features at the scale of a particular archaeological site. Moreover, computer applications in archaeology are often technology driven and software constrained. Thus, we propose a tool that tries to avoid these difficulties. We are developing an information system that works over the Internet and that is joined with a web site. Aims are to assist the work of archaeological sites managers and to be a documentation tool about these sites, dedicated to everyone. We devote therefore our system both to the professionals who are in charge of the site, and to the general public who visits it or who wants to have information on it. The system permits to do exploratory analyses of the data, especially at spatial and temporal levels. We propose to record metadata about the archaeological features in XML and to access these features through interactive 2D and 3D representations, and through queries systems (keywords and images). The 2D images, photos, or vectors are generated in SVG, while 3D models are generated in X3D. Archaeological features are also automatically integrated in a MySQL database. The web site is an exchange platform with the information system and is written in PHP.

77,"This article statistically analyses how the citation impact of articles deposited in the Condensed Matter section of the preprint server ArXiv (hosted by Cornell University), and subsequently published in a scientific journal, compares to that of articles in the same journal that were not deposited in that archive. Its principal aim is to further illustrate and roughly estimate the effect of two factors, 'early view' and 'quality bias', upon differences in citation impact between these two sets of papers, using citation data from Thomson Scientific's Web of Science. It presents estimates for a number of journals in the field of condensed matter physics. In order to discriminate between an 'open access' effect and an early view effect, longitudinal citation data was analysed covering a time period as long as 7 years. Quality bias was measured by calculating ArXiv citation impact differentials at the level of individual authors publishing in a journal, taking into account co-authorship. The analysis provided evidence of a strong quality bias and early view effect. Correcting for these effects, there is in a sample of 6 condensed matter physics journals studied in detail, no sign of a general 'open access advantage' of papers deposited in ArXiv. The study does provide evidence that ArXiv accelerates citation, due to the fact that that ArXiv makes papers earlier available rather than that it makes papers freely available.","Moed, Henk F.",Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,X07c20c0b2;X1416e5520;X15c3d0393;X1d54a57b9;X1fe9e802e;X2ef8a4546;X31505f48f;X36f4fe57b;X37206498f;X4b0703a92;X4c1b6d5d2;X527d043c7;X5a72e6a96;X5d2f1264f;X6b5393307;X6ba3c6ebb;X78486b5ac;X7c813c073;X8249adb30;X8309ca720;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X8b93b828a;X92c37c951;Xa418d1dc6;Xafe1ea12b;Xb1875d7bd;Xb973c4df9;Xba9e90876;Xda7b026af;Xdc61e69d4;Xdd0815c2d;Xe5de1dc8f;Xea0c1a83b;Xf3b223276;Xf89da9a14;Xf91b1a3ea;Xfed0ddf49,38,"The effect of ""Open access"" on citation impact: An analysis of ArXiv's condensed matter section",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0611060,2007

In order to encourage effective propagation and open access to scholarly material, CERN is implementing a range of innovative library services into its document repository: automatic keywording, reference extraction, collaborative management tools and bibliometric tools. Some of these services, such as user reviewing and automatic metadata extraction, could make up an interesting testbed for future publishing solutions and certainly provide an exciting environment for e-science possibilities.

We analyse the content of a sample of questions and responses in the community question answering system for research mathematicians, math-overflow. We find that mathoverflow is very effective, with 90% of our sample of questions answered completely or in part. A typical response is an informal dialogue, allowing error and speculation, rather than rigorous mathematical argument: 37% of our sample discussions acknowledged error. Responses typically present information known to the respondent, and readily checked by other users: thus the effectiveness of mathoverflow comes from information sharing.

82,"Through academic publications, the authors of these publications form a social network. Instead of sharing casual thoughts and photos (as in Facebook), authors pick co-authors and reference papers written by other authors. Thanks to various efforts (such as Microsoft Libra and DBLP), the data necessary for analyzing the academic social network is becoming more available on the Internet. What type of information and queries would be useful for users to find out, beyond the search queries already available from services such as Google Scholar? In this paper, we explore this question by defining a variety of ranking metrics on different entities -authors, publication venues and institutions. We go beyond traditional metrics such as paper counts, citations and h-index. Specifically, we define metrics such as influence, connections and exposure for authors. An author gains influence by receiving more citations, but also citations from influential authors. An author increases his/her connections by co-authoring with other authors, and specially from other authors with high connections. An author receives exposure by publishing in selective venues where publications received high citations in the past, and the selectivity of these venues also depends on the influence of the authors who publish there. We discuss the computation aspects of these metrics, and similarity between different metrics. With additional information of author-institution relationships, we are able to study institution rankings based on the corresponding authors' rankings for each type of metric as well as different domains. We are prepared to demonstrate these ideas with a web site (http://pubstat.org) built from millions of publications and authors.","Fu, Tom Z.

83,"World-wide collaboration in high-energy physics (HEP) is a tradition which dates back several decades, with scientific publications mostly coauthored by scientists from different countries. This coauthorship phenomenon makes it difficult to identify precisely the ``share'' of each country in HEP scientific production. One year's worth of HEP scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals is analysed and their authors are uniquely assigned to countries. This method allows the first correct estimation on a pro rata basis of the share of HEP scientific publishing among several countries and institutions. The results provide an interesting insight into the geographical collaborative patterns of the HEP community. The HEP publishing landscape is further analysed to provide information on the journals favoured by the HEP community and on the geographical variation of their author bases. These results provide quantitative input to the ongoing debate on the possible transition of HEP publishing to an Open Access model.Foreword.

84,"The explosive development of ""free"" or ""open source"" information goods contravenes the conventional wisdom that markets and commercial organizations are necessary to efficiently supply products. This paper proposes a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, using concepts from economics and theories of self-organization. Once available on the Internet, information is intrinsically not a scarce good, as it can be replicated virtually without cost. Moreover, freely distributing information is profitable to its creator, since it improves the quality of the information, and enhances the creator's reputation. This provides a sufficient incentive for people to contribute to open access projects. Unlike traditional organizations, open access communities are open, distributed and self-organizing. Coordination is achieved through stigmergy: listings of ""work-in-progress"" direct potential contributors to the tasks where their contribution is most likely to be fruitful.

We optimize parameters of our algorithm to achieve the best performance. The results are compared for two rather different citation networks: all American Physical Society publications between 1893 and 2003 and the set of high-energy physics theory (hep-th) preprints.

89,"Academic institutions, federal agencies, publishers, editors, authors, and librarians increasingly rely on citation analysis for making hiring, promotion, tenure, funding, and/or reviewer and journal evaluation and selection decisions. The Institute for Scientific Information's (ISI) citation databases have been used for decades as a starting point and often as the only tools for locating citations and/or conducting citation analyses. ISI databases (or Web of Science), however, may no longer be adequate as the only or even the main sources of citations because new databases and tools that allow citation searching are now available. Whether these new databases and tools complement or represent alternatives to Web of Science (WoS) is important to explore. Using a group of 15 library and information science faculty members as a case study, this paper examines the effects of using Scopus and Google Scholar (GS) on the citation counts and rankings of scholars as measured by WoS. The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of WoS, Scopus, and GS, their overlap and uniqueness, quality and language of the citations, and the implications of the findings for citation analysis. The project involved citation searching for approximately 1,100 scholarly works published by the study group and over 200 works by a test group (an additional 10 faculty members). Overall, more than 10,000 citing and purportedly citing documents were examined. WoS data took about 100 hours of collecting and processing time, Scopus consumed 200 hours, and GS a grueling 3,000 hours.","Meho, Lokman I.;Yang, Kiduk",ArXiv e-prints,X05aafd051;X07b1e0127;X07c20c0b2;X083eee1f9;X0865ffb58;X0c4fc62a8;X0d48bdc9f;X0fac0db83;X103eee627;X121a0e640;X167635982;X17c8095f4;X192109981;X192abc555;X1d54a57b9;X20ef97d87;X213c94f63;X23a4f2e45;X24ea42197;X27e31ea67;X2b7342c13;X2baf55aeb;X32dda2fd7;X382d65659;X3a3be41d4;X3be2f313e;X3d3f3c78b;X3e3259127;X42b7256c8;X454938de4;X47de397c4;X4c1b6d5d2;X4d3425b13;X518c4cdd8;X523b62282;X527d043c7;X54dbaa628;X57bff457f;X57cecb510;X584bdfb85;X5d2f1264f;X600c74034;X63bba9a6d;X651166acf;X6517fa7e1;X655202bc4;X68c5f1cbc;X6974142b8;X6a4df2853;X6b161e37c;X6b7e3845a;X6d6fc2c93;X6df1ff37e;X71905887d;X7765f1726;X7a090ce5b;X7c04fbf73;X7d33ffa7a;X8249adb30;X86c487c6e;X8766aa08c;X886678d23;X898d74472;X8a2a8ad8a;X8b43a8b83;X8de0a4be5;X8ea4c117e;X8fece6afc;X90b31508f;X90d4b5bab;X916bca990;X945d5fcbd;X94f76010d;X959649045;X9639016a3;X9666a1c36;X97fcaab57;X9d1ce400b;X9ddaed002;Xa0676c714;Xa126e37ca;Xa29d5c796;Xa2e8e3d09;Xa7acddcdc;Xa822483e0;Xa827202d3;Xab01a1fa1;Xac136f172;Xacc5eaecf;Xad6327e52;Xb1875d7bd;Xb3f505a24;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbc12acba4;Xbfb737ebc;Xc09d3aab7;Xc3b541121;Xc49bd15ff;Xc54619315;Xc6f11a743;Xca6fcd443;Xcd8bf0e2c;Xd011d9c1b;Xd02126129;Xd0f55148c;Xd12eba456;Xd5422746a;Xd67e58335;Xd76c9e37c;Xd825b7e90;Xdb9e3a6a7;Xdd754a763;Xe3cc004e9;Xe787886dd;Xe85c6cb6a;Xea0c1a83b;Xea38677fd;Xebbf6c936;Xed27bfcb6;Xedce4090c;Xee49eca58;Xee5f309d4;Xf07dd861a;Xf3b223276;Xf4445eeed;Xf4de6b226;Xf6bf186db;Xfa8675101;Xfba343248;Xfc697748e;Xfd3a6c532,132,"A New Era in Citation and Bibliometric Analyses: Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0612132,2006

Using recently proposed approaches of human dynamics theory we examine the probability distributions of random variables reflecting the temporal characteristics of studied processes. The first part of this paper contains our results of analysis of the real data about papers published in scientific journals. The second part is devoted to modeling of time-series connected with editorial work. The purpose of our work is to present new object that can be studied in terms of human dynamics theory and to corroborate the scientometrical application of the results obtained.,"Mryglod, O.;Holovatch, Yu.;Mryglod, I.",ArXiv e-prints,X32f27d4fe;X47aa1f6b6;X6ba7866f1;Xa1b994b71,4,Editorial process in scientific journals: analysis and modeling,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6211,2011
92,"Whenever a large group of people are engaged in an activity, communities will form. The nature of these communities depends on the relationship considered. In the group of people who regularly use scholarly literature, a relationship like ""person i and person j have cited the same paper"" might reveal communities of people working in a particular field. On this poster, we will investigate the relationship ""person i and person j have read the same paper"". Using the data logs of the NASA/Smithsonian Astrophysics Data System (ADS), we first determine the population that will participate by requiring that a user queries the ADS at a certain rate. Next, we apply the relationship to this population. The result of this will be an abstract ""relationship space"", which we will describe in terms of various ""representations"". Examples of such ""representations"" are the projection of coread vectors onto Principal Components and the spectral density of the coread network. We will show that the coread relationship results in structure, we will describe this structure and we will provide a first attempt in the classification of this structure in terms of astronomical communities.","Henneken, Edwin A.;Kurtz, M.

94,"This paper quantifies to which extent preprints in arXiv accelerate scholarly communication. The following subject fields were investigated up to the year 2012: High Energy Physics (HEP), Mathematics, Astrophysics, Quantitative Biology, and Library and Information Science (LIS). Publication and citation data was downloaded from Scopus and matched with corresponding preprints in arXiv. Furthermore, the INSPIRE HEP database was used to retrieve citation data for papers related to HEP. The bibliometric analysis deals with the growth in numbers of articles published having a previous preprint in arXiv and the publication delay, which is defined as the chronological distance between the deposit of a preprint in arXiv and its formal journal publication. Likewise, the citation delay is analyzed, which describes the time it takes until the first citation of preprints, and articles, respectively. Total citation numbers are compared for sets of articles with a previous preprint and those without. The results show that in all fields but biology a significant citation advantage exists in terms of speed and citation rates for articles with a previous preprint version on arXiv.","Aman, Valeria",ArXiv e-prints,54ecc55f1b;5547e25e9b;X079e7eb8c;X07c20c0b2;X0a9d075a7;X0b1599eda;X0d4627b8f;X1064cbf87;X1247db50a;X1877f5ed6;X18bff2d9d;X19ac28571;X1a5746e8e;X1d54a57b9;X235cdb554;X25e0939c6;X268541f55;X2a7efa9c1;X2abb24e41;X2baf55aeb;X2bc72e51c;X2c8732e96;X2dc0798ee;X2ef8a4546;X307ab4253;X323571892;X32e2e5f59;X348814447;X3510bdaa6;X399928c87;X3da6d53b9;X458220bf7;X4c1b6d5d2;X51ae66f2e;X527d043c7;X5454b93a5;X55d16dbfa;X5636cb6db;X5a72e6a96;X5bcf23bb7;X5d2f1264f;X5f5c2bd74;X6338a2696;X64b45cbba;X65d4c827a;X688f54b32;X68ffcb4e5;X6974142b8;X69a9e3f8a;X69e140b5b;X6ebbecc4b;X700cd4198;X78ef1e320;X7c1b19dfb;X7c42e8ee0;X8249adb30;X854b3e855;X85aa807fd;X86c487c6e;X8700f7949;X898d74472;X8a304c127;X8afa48272;X8dcb4afe2;X94ba7afb2;X9560745f3;X977a47b09;X9c2454dfb;X9dc71f356;X9f6a3e532;Xa14f38f4b;Xa99a1032f;Xad66e866e;Xadd66b30a;Xafc83bd12;Xb0d4aa471;Xb1875d7bd;Xb59b48a42;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbf886c6e1;Xc5297e990;Xc88b904ff;Xca87b1610;Xcb8b4991f;Xd011d9c1b;Xd0be80a96;Xd5a233bbb;Xdab809e26;Xdd1102273;Xe36e5e5fb;Xe3f0ceb62;Xe5283b6b2;Xea12199fa;Xf3b223276;Xf9ed7765a;Xfea115be2,97,The potential of preprints to accelerate scholarly communication - A bibliometric analysis based on selected journals,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4856,2013
95,"In a study of articles published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Gunther Eysenbach discovered a significant citation advantage for those articles made freely-available upon publication (Eysenbach 2006). While the author attempted to control for confounding factors that may have explained the citation differential, the study was unable to control for characteristics of the article that may have led some authors to pay the additional page charges ($1,000) for immediate OA status. OA articles published in PNAS were more than twice as likely to be featured on the front cover of the journal (3.3% vs. 1.4%), nearly twice as likely to be picked up by the media (15% vs. 8%) and when cited reached, on average, nearly twice as many news outlets as subscription-based articles (4.2 vs. 2.6). The citation advantage of Open Access articles in PNAS may likely be explained by a quality differential and the amplification of media effects.","Davis, Philip M.",ArXiv e-prints,,0,Citation advantage of Open Access articles likely explained by quality differential and media effects,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0701101,2007
96,"Eysenbach has suggested that the OA (Green) self-archiving advantage might just be an artifact of potential uncontrolled confounding factors such as article age (older articles may be both more cited and more likely to be self-archived), number of authors (articles with more authors might be more cited and more self-archived), subject matter (the subjects that are cited more, self-archive more), country (same thing), number of authors, citation counts of authors, etc. Chawki Hajjem (doctoral candidate, UQaM) had already shown that the OA advantage was present in all cases when articles were analysed separately by age, subject matter or country. He has now done a multiple regression analysis jointly testing (1) article age, (2) journal impact factor, (3) number of authors, and (4) OA self-archiving as separate factors for 442,750 articles in 576 (biomedical) journals across 11 years, and has shown that each of the four factors contributes an independent, statistically significant increment to the citation counts. The OA-self-archiving advantage remains a robust, independent factor. Having successfully responded to his challenge, we now challenge Eysenbach to demonstrate -- by testing a sufficiently broad and representative sample of journals at all levels of the journal quality, visibility and prestige hierarchy -- that his finding of a citation advantage for Gold OA (articles published OA on the high-profile website of the only journal he tested (PNAS) over Green OA articles in the same journal (self-archived on the author's website) was not just an artifact of having tested only one very high-profile journal.","Hajjem, Chawki;Harnad, Stevan",ArXiv e-prints,X2445ab3e6;X4fc7fbbc0;X87b775f9f;Xdcdcdea5f;Xf55cefcd5,5,"Citation Advantage For OA Self-Archiving Is Independent of Journal Impact Factor, Article Age, and Number of Co-Authors",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0701136,2007

98,"Many studies have now reported the positive correlation between Open Access (OA) self-archiving and citation counts (""OA Advantage,"" OAA). But does this OAA occur because (QB) authors are more likely to self-selectively self-archive articles that are more likely to be cited (self-selection ""Quality Bias"": QB)? or because (QA) articles that are self-archived are more likely to be cited (""Quality Advantage"": QA)? The probable answer is both. Three studies [by (i) Kurtz and co-workers in astrophysics, (ii) Moed in condensed matter physics, and (iii) Davis & Fromerth in mathematics] had reported the OAA to be due to QB [plus Early Advantage, EA, from self-archiving the preprint before publication, in (i) and (ii)] rather than QA.

102,"Purpose: To provide a critical review of Bergman's 2001 study on the Deep Web. In addition, we bring a new concept into the discussion, the Academic Invisible Web (AIW). We define the Academic Invisible Web as consisting of all databases and collections relevant to academia but not searchable by the general-purpose internet search engines. Indexing this part of the Invisible Web is central to scientific search engines. We provide an overview of approaches followed thus far. Design/methodology/approach: Discussion of measures and calculations, estimation based on informetric laws. Literature review on approaches for uncovering information from the Invisible Web. Findings: Bergman's size estimate of the Invisible Web is highly questionable. We demonstrate some major errors in the conceptual design of the Bergman paper. A new (raw) size estimate is given. Research limitations/implications: The precision of our estimate is limited due to a small sample size and lack of reliable data. Practical implications: We can show that no single library alone will be able to index the Academic Invisible Web. We suggest collaboration to accomplish this task. Originality/value: Provides library managers and those interested in developing academic search engines with data on the size and attributes of the Academic Invisible Web.","Lewandowski, Dirk;Mayr, Philipp",ArXiv e-prints,X009910695;X073618125;X0c7dea840;X18aea8e25;X197557d0b;X1c55977d6;X2910dd6b8;X5efbc3586;X5efd1f59c;X678ac3eaf;X6bb1ae9ee;X6da728a62;X7793f5670;X7a8c7a515;X8290ea499;Xa842bd040;Xaee6caaf0;Xafbec6c42;Xb00e3328f;Xb01757f4e;Xb4aea3b2c;Xb6ac2cae0;Xc71d92429;Xd623d64cd;Xd947a2bd9;Xe2510b7f9;Xe5ff250a6;Xe94c4fbba;Xf73f6ea72;Xfbb0bb842;Xfe0c99aa6,31,Exploring the academic invisible web,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0702103,2007
103,"In Korean culture, the names of family members are recorded in special family books. This makes it possible to follow the distribution of Korean family names far back in history. It is shown here that these name distributions are well described by a simple null model, the random group formation (RGF) model. This model makes it possible to predict how the name distributions change and these predictions are shown to be borne out. In particular, the RGF model predicts that for married women entering a collection of family books in a certain year, the occurrence of the most common family name 'Kim' should be directly proportional to the total number of married women with the same proportionality constant for all the years. This prediction is also borne out to a high degree. We speculate that it reflects some inherent social stability in the Korean culture. In addition, we obtain an estimate of the total population of the Korean culture down to the year 500 AD, based on the RGF model, and find about ten thousand Kims.","Baek, Seung Ki;Minnhagen, Petter;Kim, Beom Jun",New Journal of Physics,X37ffea476;X571bd8c26;X5d21e31d8;X741325e49;Xb067b6d45;Xd5425e3a2;Xf21b54e72,7,The ten thousand Kims,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6221,2011

Despite the apparent lack of order, the 50 million edits by 4.8 million contributors to the 1.5 million articles in the English-language Wikipedia follow strong certain overall regularities. We show that the accretion of edits to an article is described by a simple stochastic mechanism, resulting in a heavy tail of highly visible articles with a large number of edits.

105,"This paper examines the difference and similarities between the two on-line computer science citation databases DBLP and CiteSeer. The database entries in DBLP are inserted manually while the CiteSeer entries are obtained autonomously via a crawl of the Web and automatic processing of user submissions. CiteSeer's autonomous citation database can be considered a form of self-selected on-line survey. It is important to understand the limitations of such databases, particularly when citation information is used to assess the performance of authors, institutions and funding bodies. We show that the CiteSeer database contains considerably fewer single author papers. This bias can be modeled by an exponential process with intuitive explanation. The model permits us to predict that the DBLP database covers approximately 24% of the entire literature of Computer Science. CiteSeer is also biased against low-cited papers. Despite their difference, both databases exhibit similar and significantly different citation distributions compared with previous analysis of the Physics community. In both databases, we also observe that the number of authors per paper has been increasing over time.","Petricek, Vaclav;Cox, Ingemar J.;Han, Hui;Councill, Isaac G.;Giles, C.

106,"Collaboration networks arise when we map the connections between scientists which are formed through joint publications. These networks thus display the social structure of academia, and also allow conclusions about the structure of scientific knowledge. Using the computer science publication database DBLP, we compile relations between authors and publications as graphs and proceed with examining and quantifying collaborative relations with graph-based methods. We review standard properties of the network and rank authors and publications by centrality. Additionally, we detect communities with modularity-based clustering and compare the resulting clusters to a ground-truth based on conferences and thus topical similarity. In a second part, we are the first to combine DBLP network data with data from the Dagstuhl Seminars: We investigate whether seminars of this kind, as social and academic events designed to connect researchers, leave a visible track in the structure of the collaboration network. Our results suggest that such single events are not influential enough to change the network structure significantly. However, the network structure seems to influence a participant's decision to accept or decline an invitation.","Staudt, Christian;Schumm, Andrea;Meyerhenke, Henning;Görke, Robert;Wagner, Dorothea",ArXiv e-prints,X06e3fb9dd;X19edfbf18;X1f392e2c6;X2e408fc45;X370697701;X393bf8147;X453a162ba;X48a3aaa9b;X49aa950a1;X5af56a5a1;X5b990050c;X6fc6944d8;X80db08a9e;X818cdb34e;X8d3cbaf72;X9c1cd6823;Xaacb59bee;Xb275be4f4;Xb38083353;Xb67dce1d1;Xb9751ae91;Xbe94601df;Xc03b8eae1;Xc4a2bd68b;Xc7dca9b9f;Xca2765712;Xced704c76;Xcfd0d0bf5;Xd3590a4e1;Xda7b026af,30,Static and Dynamic Aspects of Scientific Collaboration Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5268,2013
107,"Search engines provide cached copies of indexed content so users will have something to ""click on"" if the remote resource is temporarily or permanently unavailable. Depending on their proprietary caching strategies, search engines will purge their indexes and caches of resources that exceed a threshold of unavailability. Although search engine caches are provided only as an aid to the interactive user, we are interested in building reliable preservation services from the aggregate of these limited caching services. But first, we must understand the contents of search engine caches. In this paper, we have examined the cached contents of Ask, Google, MSN and Yahoo to profile such things as overlap between index and cache, size, MIME type and ""staleness"" of the cached resources. We also examined the overlap of the various caches with the holdings of the Internet Archive.","McCown, Frank;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X0d95dbccd;X27ac6e426;X6f8e68bae;X90acbb8c6;X9756f77f3;Xa0706c9d5;Xa69fdebd8;Xc2fff1b33,8,Characterization of Search Engine Caches,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0703083,2007
108,"Building on ideas from linguistics, psychology, and social sciences about the possible mechanisms of human decision-making, we propose a novel theoretical framework for the citation analysis. Given the existing trend to investigate citation statistics in the context of various forms of power and Zipfian laws, we show that the popular models of citation have very poor predictive ability and can hardly provide for an adequate explanation of the observed behavior of the empirical data. An alternative model is then derived, using the apparatus of statistical mechanics. The model is applied to approximate the citation frequencies of scientific articles from two large collections, and it demonstrates a predictive potential much superior to the one of any of the citation models known to the authors from the literature. Analytical properties of the developed model are discussed, and conclusions are drawn. Some directions for future work are also given at the paper's end.","Kryssanov, Victor V.;Kuleshov, Evgeny L.;Rinaldo, Frank J.;Ogawa, Hitoshi",ArXiv e-prints,X1e11fba4c;X46f120204;X51fff72c6;X55833de15;X9698870fc;Xa8938bd46;Xdc9e22c30,7,We cite as we communicate: A communication model for the citation process,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0703115,2007

111,"Information integration applications, such as mediators or mashups, that require access to information resources currently rely on users manually discovering and integrating them in the application. Manual resource discovery is a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained via keyword-based search. Although search methods have advanced to include evidence from document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of the referring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources -- often called ``the hidden Web''-- that dynamically generate documents in response to a query. The recently popular social bookmarking sites, which allow users to annotate and share metadata about various information sources, provide rich evidence for resource discovery. In this paper, we describe a probabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking system del.icio.us. We then use the model to automatically find resources relevant to a particular information domain. Our experimental results on data obtained from \emph{del.icio.us} show this approach as a promising method for helping automate the resource discovery task.","Plangprasopchok, Anon;Lerman, Kristina",ArXiv e-prints,X2cb945542;X469132167;X6ea0208c4;X7793f5670;X82149bedb;X84655e7a3;X93b00a340;Xa1df58335;Xc33992304;Xca20dbb99,10,Exploiting Social Annotation for Automatic Resource Discovery,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1675,2007

113,"The social media site Flickr allows users to upload their photos, annotate them with tags, submit them to groups, and also to form social networks by adding other users as contacts. Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or searching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a specific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an insect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not relevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim that users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in the form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this metadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search performance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision by filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network that includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic model that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics contained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be described by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics found by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding images on topics that are of interest to the user.","Lerman, Kristina;Plangprasopchok, Anon;Wong, Chio",ArXiv e-prints,X087bd5223;X1fbfab038;X24362d913;X36019d132;X367c4ee92;X3c6dff852;X3f12ea6e5;X4157e801c;X4aca07190;X57cbed2aa;X596b66260;X5ac0e0986;X5b72b34cb;X659799cf4;X6ea0208c4;X6fc6944d8;X812bc3182;X8fd93ee3d;X964e92ead;Xab6148654;Xb0f8441c5;Xb1fca9277;Xb6b822cc9;Xbc32a4fd2;Xbd3d32211;Xd69b98c13;Xd7470d6fa;Xdd7cccfc5;Xf18aff43d,29,Personalizing Image Search Results on Flickr,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1676,2007
114,"The approach of quantifying the damage inflicted on a graph in Albert, Jeong and Barabsi's (AJB) report ""Error and Attack Tolerance of Complex Networks"" using the size of the largest connected component and the average size of the remaining components does not capture our intuitive idea of the damage to a graph caused by disconnections. We evaluate an alternative metric based on average inverse path lengths (AIPLs) that better fits our intuition that a graph can still be reasonably functional even when it is disconnected. We compare our metric with AJB's using a test set of graphs and report the differences. AJB's report should not be confused with a report by Crucitti et al. with the same name. Based on our analysis of graphs of different sizes and types, and using various numerical and statistical tools; the ratio of the average inverse path lengths of a connected graph of the same size as the sum of the size of the fragments of the disconnected graph can be used as a metric about the damage of a graph by the removal of an edge or a node. This damage is reported in the range (0,1) where 0 means that the removal had no effect on the graph's capability to perform its functions. A 1 means that the graph is totally dysfunctional. We exercise our metric on a collection of sample graphs that have been subjected to various attack profiles that focus on edge, node or degree betweenness values. We believe that this metric can be used to quantify the damage done to the graph by an attacker, and that it can be used in evaluating the positive effect of adding additional edges to an existing graph.","Cartledge, Charles L.;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X1ba4bf3c5;X3f82c45ef;X5a4569e84;X8290ea499;X8850fca4a;X8df741bd0;X94530b842;X9fae16ba5;Xb4bb0d177;Xc2034ba28;Xc27e0740c,11,Connectivity Damage to a Graph by the Removal of an Edge or a Vertex,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3075,2011

Now the field needs to radically broaden its research focus to attack the issues of capturing, storing, analyzing, and presenting the vast array of online data.

117,"This thesis investigates in the use of access log data as a source of information for identifying related scientific papers. This is done for arXiv.org, the authority for publication of e-prints in several fields of physics. Compared to citation information, access logs have the advantage of being immediately available, without manual or automatic extraction of the citation graph. Because of that, a main focus is on the question, how far user behavior can serve as a replacement for explicit meta-data, which potentially might be expensive or completely unavailable. Therefore, we compare access, content, and citation-based measures of relatedness on different recommendation tasks. As a final result, an online recommendation system has been built that can help scientists to find further relevant literature, without having to search for them actively.","Pohl, Stefan",ArXiv e-prints,550bc9732c;X0a6a434ae;X1aebeb650;X1e19adb65;X6ba3c6ebb;X87a23018f;X911760f4f;Xa3167a832;Xa57f25018;Xa9c7e8a6d;Xb6d962c06,11,Using Access Data for Paper Recommendations on ArXiv.org,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2963,2007
118,"Internet-based personal digital belongings present different vulnerabilities than locally stored materials. We use responses to a survey of people who have recovered lost websites, in combination with supplementary interviews, to paint a fuller picture of current curatorial strategies and practices. We examine the types of personal, topical, and commercial websites that respondents have lost and the reasons they have lost this potentially valuable material. We further explore what they have tried to recover and how the loss influences their subsequent practices. We found that curation of personal digital materials in online stores bears some striking similarities to the curation of similar materials stored locally in that study participants continue to archive personal assets by relying on a combination of benign neglect, sporadic backups, and unsystematic file replication. However, we have also identified issues specific to Internet-based material: how risk is spread by distributing the files among multiple servers and services; the circular reasoning participants use when they discuss the safety of their digital assets; and the types of online material that are particularly vulnerable to loss. The study reveals ways in which expectations of permanence and notification are violated and situations in which benign neglect has far greater consequences for the long-term fate of important digital assets.","Marshall, Catherine C.;McCown, Frank;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X0f072384d;X0ffa40550;X125250032;X22f63931a;X2b319620f;X3a0b664b9;X3e6dbf677;X4d416315d;X57e6720b2;X5a04023e5;X5d2961088;X5eba7944b;X641205ae7;X6a4d56723;X6bfc76615;X723ae5bb4;X785816b7e;X7d3be0628;X81599975f;X87fa70e21;X8cb528d86;X99f28eef0;X9c8e43f43;Xa43c91826;Xaaa24a498;Xaee6caaf0;Xb1f93f6f3;Xc3c74e49b;Xca3fe03be;Xcf4f1e6b9;Xd63e86c37;Xe92fc77c1;Xef1e7779c,33,Evaluating Personal Archiving Strategies for Internet-based Information,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3647,2007

120,"We conducted a preliminary field study to understand the current state of personal digital archiving in practice. Our aim is to design a service for the long-term storage, preservation, and access of digital belongings by examining how personal archiving needs intersect with existing and emerging archiving technologies, best practices, and policies. Our findings not only confirmed that experienced home computer users are creating, receiving, and finding an increasing number of digital belongings, but also that they have already lost irreplaceable digital artifacts such as photos, creative efforts, and records. Although participants reported strategies such as backup and file replication for digital safekeeping, they were seldom able to implement them consistently. Four central archiving themes emerged from the data: (1) people find it difficult to evaluate the worth of accumulated materials; (2) personal storage is highly distributed both on- and offline; (3) people are experiencing magnified curatorial problems associated with managing files in the aggregate, creating appropriate metadata, and migrating materials to maintainable formats; and (4) facilities for long-term access are not supported by the current desktop metaphor. Four environmental factors further complicate archiving in consumer settings: the pervasive influence of malware; consumer reliance on ad hoc IT providers; an accretion of minor system and registry inconsistencies; and strong consumer beliefs about the incorruptibility of digital forms, the reliability of digital technologies, and the social vulnerability of networked storage.","Marshall, Catherine C.;Bly, Sara;Brun-Cottan, Francoise",ArXiv e-prints,X05889a1aa;X0a2eb7cce;X0ab9afca3;X0bf11a0cf;X104713b5d;X120881240;X13b9a6e56;X14e9eeeea;X1a45fa9b4;X230ce2817;X253b4e803;X27d479c7f;X28ea3c61e;X29e2c309d;X2ac795ac6;X2cedc914c;X2d7333ef5;X2ebf92363;X3450ec3dc;X38beaaf08;X424cfde17;X4543bf3b9;X4fcb68a5c;X507c373c1;X50ea12939;X516271f0c;X52613760e;X57e6720b2;X6270efe53;X62e74cb78;X65f5bd093;X682eb5544;X6d091542f;X6d364f5df;X7169812a5;X72d09ec27;X7549a6735;X7e892c523;X82c8f22a7;X892b6038e;X90a54a943;X9554ca1e3;X96d4ee4e4;X99f28eef0;X9a91cf7e2;X9b9ec0683;X9c427a56c;Xa0e897a6e;Xa346b2c65;Xa5044b630;Xa7078b564;Xac55a5184;Xacb0a16b7;Xadd704ea2;Xaead67faf;Xb0c5ea518;Xb93b2deeb;Xbce8bc34a;Xbe2328a9d;Xc2ee7843a;Xc8006efbf;Xca908beee;Xce4b95855;Xce505b27c;Xd30295ec5;Xdc4dca7f9;Xdc6619b22;Xe60b2cf34;Xeae8cbdee;Xf16b99f14;Xf261b8341;Xf2b6a4598;Xfaa2b6562;Xfb6d1e9c1;Xfbb4045fb;Xfc2037ffe;Xfc814b7c7;Xffc1bb31e;Xffe1939c4,79,The Long Term Fate of Our Digital Belongings: Toward a Service Model for Personal Archives,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3653,2007

122,"Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry and academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to add data items and to attach their own metadata (or tags) to stored data. The result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content and the metadata become harder to manage due to an ease in content diversity. Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to improve the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This paper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability in a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of two collaborative tagging communities that target scientific literature: CiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze the tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover the structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover suggests a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals with unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests. Finally, we offer preliminary results that demonstrate that the interest-based structure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content usage as communities scale.","Santos-Neto, Elizeu;Ripeanu, Matei;Iamnitchi, Adriana",ArXiv e-prints,X2e31b8b2a;X3a0e2dfed;X4157e801c;X548f2ad14;X6a0960889;X6e73180cf;X7d07730b9;Xa891a6853;Xadfeaf176;Xb08eea7f7;Xf7aaadcc6,11,Tracking User Attention in Collaborative Tagging Communities,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1013,2007

Here I propose a new concept for scientific journals that ensures rapid, impartial and comprehensive (RIC) publishing. RIC concept is based on implementation of two novel publishing principles: the first (rapid) editorial screening of a submitted manuscript should result in its either ""rejection"" or ""acceptance with optional revisions"", and, in the latter case, the optionally revised (taking into account open reviews) paper should be published along with all (positive and negative) reviews, presenting thereby to the scientific community all available scientific material on the topic in question.","Bozhevolnyi, Sergey I.",ArXiv e-prints,X007a06783;X4f6ce33a2;Xc9898dd7b;Xe85c55865,4,"Rapid, Impartial and Comprehensive (RIC) publishing: A new concept for scientific journals",http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0791,2011

However new movements in Europe are attempting to make the peer-reviewed literature of the field fully Open Access. This is not a new movement, nor is it restricted to this field. However, given the field's history of preprints and eprints, it is well suited to a change to a fully Open Access publishing model. Data shows that 90% of HEP published literature is freely available online, meaning that HEP libraries have little need for expensive journal subscriptions. As libraries begin to cancel journal subscriptions, the peer review process will lose its primary source of funding. Open Access publishing models can potentially address this issue. European physicists and funding agencies are proposing a consortium, SCOAP3, that might solve many of the objections to traditional Open Access publishing models in Particle Physics.

These templates are not consistent across users and over time. Rule-based parsing of these templates is expensive to maintain and tends to fail as new documents are added. Statistical techniques based on frequent occurrences have the potential to identify automatically a large fraction of the templates, thus reducing the burden on the programmers. We investigate the case of the Project Gutenberg corpus, where most documents are in ASCII format with preambles and epilogues that are often copied and pasted or manually typed.

131,"In this paper we review the socalled altmetrics or alternative metrics. This concept raises from the development of new indicators based on Web 2.0, for the evaluation of the research and academic activity. The basic assumption is that variables such as mentions in blogs, number of twits or of researchers bookmarking a research paper for instance, may be legitimate indicators for measuring the use and impact of scientific publications. In this sense, these indicators are currently the focus of the bibliometric community and are being discussed and debated. We describe the main platforms and indicators and we analyze as a sample the Spanish research output in Communication Studies. Comparing traditional indicators such as citations with these new indicators. The results show that the most cited papers are also the ones with a highest impact according to the altmetrics. We conclude pointing out the main shortcomings these metrics present and the role they may play when measuring the research impact through 2.0 platforms.","Torres-Salinas, Daniel;Cabezas-Clavijo, Alvaro;Jimenez-Contreras, Evaristo",ArXiv e-prints,54f7116dea;X08d37d194;X0954e8445;X0b8a2aa79;X1662628a8;X16bea4631;X1ace430c9;X1b428b7a5;X36a02b34a;X3974931a6;X461204f76;X4b0434028;X4b595c248;X53a1b7cd5;X5c8fa2b8c;X615242ac8;X65576f938;X6c74a1aa2;X6ea0208c4;X81e3b9813;X8571ef23e;X937b62653;X99ed561df;X9db108d3e;X9f034e8a2;Xa1b994b71;Xa7a75d8a2;Xa7f194a1f;Xa91ee9921;Xa9f1f0d82;Xb0440a6cc;Xc022645f4;Xc12a2e5fb;Xc361e1f66;Xc4c0ad844;Xc867eb555;Xc9554cc9a;Xca916fbb5;Xd23b37e48;Xd2dc2e54d;Xd5d54663e;Xdc4fe7123;Xdce8a2f66;Xdd2d6aed0;Xea762bbfb;Xeb54f9aa0;Xed54abb40;Xfa8c41d8e;Xfbb091325,49,Altmetrics: New Indicators for Scientific Communication in Web 2.0,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6595,2013

133,"The exponential increase in publication rate of new articles is limiting access of researchers to relevant literature. This has prompted the use of text mining tools to extract key biological information. Previous studies have reported extensive modification of existing generic text processors to process biological text. However, this requirement for modification had not been examined. In this study, we have constructed Muscorian, using MontyLingua, a generic text processor. It uses a two-layered generalization-specialization paradigm previously proposed where text was generically processed to a suitable intermediate format before domain-specific data extraction techniques are applied at the specialization layer. Evaluation using a corpus and experts indicated 86-90% precision and approximately 30% recall in extracting protein-protein interactions, which was comparable to previous studies using either specialized biological text processing tools or modified existing tools. Our study had also demonstrated the flexibility of the two-layered generalization-specialization paradigm by using the same generalization layer for two specialized information extraction tasks.","Ling, Maurice HT;Lefevre, Christophe;Nicholas, Kevin R.;Lin, Feng",ArXiv e-prints,X0de4b5f17;X1497cb17a;X24554abb1;X2baf55aeb;X693778a81;X6a780fe61;X721774ae6;X8014d10c3;X8536cedf1;Xd93b9b9b2;Xe184cf59b,11,Reconstruction of Protein-Protein Interaction Pathways by Mining Subject-Verb-Objects Intermediates,http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0694,2007

135,"In this study we develop and propose publication metrics, based on an analysis of data from the Chandra bibliographic database, that are more meaningful and less sensitive to observatory-specific characteristics than are the traditional metrics. They fall in three main categories: speed of publication, fraction of observing time published, and archival usage. Citation of results is a fourth category, but lends itself less well to definite statements. For Chandra, the median time from observation to publication is 2.36 years; after about 7 years 90% of the observing time is published; after 10 years 70% of the observing time is published more than twice; and the total annual publication output of the mission is 60--70% of the cumulative observing time available, assuming a two-year lag between data retrieval and publication.","Rots, Arnold H.;Winkelman, Sherry L.;Becker, Glenn E.",Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,54e75a0796;X3457b9b6c;X4a60f764d;X4c2ca4bd6;X6bfc76615;X85eb2257d;X96b1d5a34;X995c1477b;Xd90d1d157;Xda26b70db;Xed27096d7,11,Chandra Publication Statistics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1212,2012
136,"The large-scale analysis of scholarly artifact usage is constrained primarily by current practices in usage data archiving, privacy issues concerned with the dissemination of usage data, and the lack of a practical ontology for modeling the usage domain. As a remedy to the third constraint, this article presents a scholarly ontology that was engineered to represent those classes for which large-scale bibliographic and usage data exists, supports usage research, and whose instantiation is scalable to the order of 50 million articles along with their associated artifacts (e.g. authors and journals) and an accompanying 1 billion usage events. The real world instantiation of the presented abstract ontology is a semantic network model of the scholarly community which lends the scholarly process to statistical analysis and computational support. We present the ontology, discuss its instantiation, and provide some example inference rules for calculating various scholarly artifact metrics.","Rodriguez, Marko A.;Bollen, Johah;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X1d54a57b9;X26d20098a;X2f6926ad5;X34e0b180a;X4321a452f;X5749d0b8e;X580c6c903;X5a40fa366;X6fb60d368;Xc3b843369;Xd464b36c9;Xe3f53d446;Xed0e43df5;Xf9a37d050,14,A Practical Ontology for the Large-Scale Modeling of Scholarly Artifacts and their Usage,http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1150,2007
137,"Recommender systems are crucial tools to overcome the information overload brought about by the Internet. Rigorous tests are needed to establish to what extent sophisticated methods can improve the quality of the predictions. Here we analyse a refined correlation-based collaborative filtering algorithm and compare it with a novel spectral method for recommending. We test them on two databases that bear different statistical properties (MovieLens and Jester) without filtering out the less active users and ordering the opinions in time, whenever possible. We find that, when the distribution of user-user correlations is narrow, simple averages work nearly as well as advanced methods. Recommender systems can, on the other hand, exploit a great deal of additional information in systems where external influence is negligible and peoples' tastes emerge entirely. These findings are validated by simulations with artificially generated data.","Blattner, Marcel;Hunziker, Alexander;Laureti, Paolo",ArXiv e-prints,X04110c077;X4a54254e9;X5d21e31d8;X7ee86c99d;X9cf4cfa5d;Xafc83bd12;Xb067b6d45;Xc3b843369;Xc72713e98;Xe02c0e78f,10,When are recommender systems useful?,http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2562,2007
138,"Tagging communities represent a subclass of a broader class of user-generated content-sharing online communities. In such communities users introduce and tag content for later use. Although recent studies advocate and attempt to harness social knowledge in this context by exploiting collaboration among users, little research has been done to quantify the current level of user collaboration in these communities. This paper introduces two metrics to quantify the level of collaboration: content reuse and shared interest. Using these two metrics, this paper shows that the current level of collaboration in CiteULike and Connotea is consistently low, which significantly limits the potential of harnessing the social knowledge in communities. This study also discusses implications of these findings in the context of recommendation and reputation systems.","Santos-Neto, Elizeu;Ripeanu, Matei;Iamnitchi, Adriana",ArXiv e-prints,X104227516;X21bff4ece;Xa2dcdc02e;Xb1fb06810;Xfe0f3757c,5,Content Reuse and Interest Sharing in Tagging Communities,http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.4142,2007

Given a query q, we first consider Simrank as a way to identify queries similar to q, i.e., queries whose ads a user may be interested in. We argue that Simrank fails to properly identify query similarities in our application, and we present two enhanced version of Simrank: one that exploits weights on click graph edges and another that exploits ``evidence.'' We experimentally evaluate our new schemes against Simrank, using actual click graphs and queries form Yahoo!, and using a variety of metrics. Our results show that the enhanced methods can yield more and better query rewrites.","Antonellis, Ioannis;Garcia-Molina, Hector;Chang, Chi-Chao",ArXiv e-prints,X0a0171688;X0ee5cfd6e;X11e130348;X20f62926c;X23af59de0;X249ae746a;X260545dce;X2d5b94028;X2d9479bba;X2d99e0cff;X32ddc0a6b;X358a0f27a;X3656d6622;X3ac5bfb1e;X3f01825a3;X5720c9940;X5c46492b3;X5d63dc082;X5e27693d1;X622f1d416;X65794841b;X66033502f;X6ba7310ad;X6e5fec150;X719beefdb;X77535ce34;X784b7abd5;X7a563ee39;X84e42439b;X8870c16ca;X93c0a3a40;X98331179e;X9b2b27f68;X9cc3ad29b;Xa77593789;Xaba2289c5;Xafccf756c;Xb027183fc;Xb0f05d329;Xb58eca9c6;Xb7cf2338a;Xc79d5bdbc;Xd593cfac9;Xd92ed3dca;Xdcff32f1a;Xe28431764;Xea43ee5b5;Xeb8326d67;Xf1784896d;Xf3e61521c;Xf5b7a2e61;Xf94f10f1b;Xfe6e5c267,53,Simrank++: Query rewriting through link analysis of the click graph,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0499,2007
140,"We study the dependence of citation counts of e-Prints published on the arXiv:astro-ph server on their position in the daily astro-ph listing. Using the SPIRES literature database we reconstruct the astro-ph listings from 2002 July to 2005 December and determine citation counts for e-Prints from their ADS entry. We use Zipf plots to analyze the citation distributions for each astro-ph position. We find that e-Prints appearing at or near the top of the astro-ph mailings receive significantly more citations than those further down the list. This difference is significant at the 7 level and on average amounts to 2 times more citations for papers at the top than those further down the listing. We propose three possible nonexclusive explanations for this positional citation effect and try to test them. We conclude that self-promotion by authors plays a role in the observed effect but cannot exclude that increased visibility at the top of the daily listings contributes to higher citation counts as well. We can rule out that the positional dependence of citations is caused by the coincidence of the submission deadline with the working hours of a geographically constrained set of intrinsically higher-cited authors. We discuss several ways of mitigating the observed effect, including splitting astro-ph into several subject classes, randomizing the order of e-Prints, and a novel approach to sorting entries by relevance to individual readers.","Dietrich, J.

142,"The peer review system has been traditionally challenged due to its many limitations especially for allocating funding. Bibliometric indicators may well present themselves as a complement. Objective: We analyze the relationship between peers' ratings and bibliometric indicators for Spanish researchers in the 2007 National R&D Plan for 23 research fields. We analyze peers' ratings for 2333 applications. We also gathered principal investigators' research output and impact and studied the differences between accepted and rejected applications. We used the Web of Science database and focused on the 2002-2006 period. First, we analyzed the distribution of granted and rejected proposals considering a given set of bibliometric indicators to test if there are significant differences. Then, we applied a multiple logistic regression analysis to determine if bibliometric indicators can explain by themselves the concession of grant proposals. 63.4% of the applications were funded. Bibliometric indicators for accepted proposals showed a better previous performance than for those rejected; however the correlation between peer review and bibliometric indicators is very heterogeneous among most areas. The logistic regression analysis showed that the main bibliometric indicators that explain the granting of research proposals in most cases are the output (number of published articles) and the number of papers published in journals that belong to the first quartile ranking of the Journal Citations Report. Bibliometric indicators predict the concession of grant proposals at least as well as peer ratings. Social Sciences and Education are the only areas where no relation was found, although this may be due to the limitations of the Web of Science's coverage. These findings encourage the use of bibliometric indicators as a complement to peer review in most of the analyzed areas.","Cabezas-Clavijo, Álvaro;Robinson-García, Nicolás;Escabias, Manuel;Jiménez-Contreras, Evaristo",PLoS ONE,X019aba7e2;X026e4c91b;X0e2233956;X18c892cbd;X26c85deb2;X32d41d9d2;X405e020ab;X49e3c1819;X4a5c1fd62;X59ffb11fc;X67f1cff07;X690ebf152;X6b3b20cb9;X8228ba9dc;X8ba0aeb06;X8e28e18c7;Xa1b994b71;Xb207c1d68;Xb3e47aa3f;Xbdf022cf2;Xcc85914e9,21,Reviewers' Ratings and Bibliometric Indicators: Hand in Hand When Assessing Over Research Proposals?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0110,2013
143,"In any search-based digital library (DL) systems dealing with a non-trivial number of documents, users are often required to go through a long list of short document descriptions in order to identify what they are looking for. To tackle the problem, a variety of document organization algorithms and/or visualization techniques have been used to guide users in selecting relevant documents. Since these techniques require heavy computations, however, we developed a presentation server designed to serve as an intermediary between retrieval servers and clients equipped with a visualization interface. In addition, we designed our own visual interface by which users can view a set of documents from different perspectives through layers of document maps. We finally ran experiments to show that the visual interface, in conjunction with the presentation server, indeed helps users in selecting relevant documents from the retrieval results.","Song, Sa-Kwang;Hyon Myaeng, Sung",ArXiv e-prints,X1ebdef53f;X45978c3c3;X657ced61f,3,Visualization of Retrieved Documents using a Presentation Server,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902021,1999

145,"This article presents a study that compares detected structural communities in a coauthorship network to the socioacademic characteristics of the scholars that compose the network. The coauthorship network was created from the bibliographic record of a multi-institution, interdisciplinary research group focused on the study of sensor networks and wireless communication. Four different community detection algorithms were employed to assign a structural community to each scholar in the network: leading eigenvector, walktrap, edge betweenness and spinglass. Socioacademic characteristics were gathered from the scholars and include such information as their academic department, academic affiliation, country of origin, and academic position. A Pearson's $\chi^2$ test, with a simulated Monte Carlo, revealed that structural communities best represent groupings of individuals working in the same academic department and at the same institution. A generalization of this result suggests that, even in interdisciplinary, multi-institutional research groups, coauthorship is primarily driven by departmental and institutional affiliation.","Rodriguez, Marko A.;Pepe, Alberto",ArXiv e-prints,X284497e3f;X2c3235589;X3ea61db73;X46be42b82;X8c1cf8cd0;X93c673ffe;X9cefb2664;X9e192016c;Xbdc77d85d;Xe3378c4d4;Xec11f84d3;Xf0877183d;Xf9a37d050,13,On the relationship between the structural and socioacademic communities of a coauthorship network,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2345,2008
146,"The purpose of the paper is to propose models to reduce the semantic complexity in heterogeneous DLs. The aim is to introduce value-added services (treatment of term vagueness and document re-ranking) that gain a certain quality in DLs if they are combined with heterogeneity components established in the project ""Competence Center Modeling and Treatment of Semantic Heterogeneity"". Empirical observations show that freely formulated user terms and terms from controlled vocabularies are often not the same or match just by coincidence. Therefore, a value-added service will be developed which rephrases the natural language searcher terms into suggestions from the controlled vocabulary, the Search Term Recommender (STR). Two methods, which are derived from scientometrics and network analysis, will be implemented with the objective to re-rank result sets by the following structural properties: the ranking of the results by core journals (so-called Bradfordizing) and ranking by centrality of authors in co-authorship networks.","Mayr, Philipp;Mutschke, Peter;Petras, Vivien",ArXiv e-prints,54e1736544;X00858da8f;Xa1b994b71;Xa3d1b3e1b;Xaac82a73c;Xf33d97589,6,Reducing semantic complexity in distributed Digital Libraries: treatment of term vagueness and document re-ranking,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2449,2007
147,"This study aims to analyse whether library loans statistics can be used as a measure of monograph use and as a selection criteria for inclusion in citation indexes. For this, we conducted an exploratory study based on loan data (1000 most borrowed monographs) from two non-Anglo-Saxon European university libraries (Granada and Vienna) with strong social sciences and humanities components. Loans to scientists only were also analysed at the University of Vienna. Furthermore, citation counts for the 100 most borrowed scientific monographs (SM) and textbooks or manuals (MTB) were retrieved from Web of Science and Google Scholar. The results show considerable similarities in both libraries: the percentage of loans for books in national languages represents almost 96 per cent of the total share and SM accounts only for 10 to 13 per cent. When considering loans to scientists only, the percentage of English books increases to 30 per cent, the percentage of SM loans also increases (approx 80 per cent). Furthermore, we found no significant correlations between loans and citations. Since loan statistics are currently insufficient for measuring the use of monographs, their suggested use as an applicable selection criterion for book citation indexes is not yet feasible. Data improvement and aggregation at different levels is a challenge for modern libraries in order to enable the exploitation of this invaluable information source for scientometric purposes.","Cabezas-Clavijo, Álvaro;Robinson-García, Nicolás;Torres-Salinas, Daniel;Jiménez-Contreras, Evaristo;Mikulka, Thomas;Gumpenberger, Christian;Wemisch, Ambros;Gorraiz, Juan",ArXiv e-prints,X004d95382;X0ad35f7c7;X0ddb45599;X1ce015912;X2d2cdd016;X3df9e8470;X4ff4aa954;X5d28fb8ae;X62857d334;X654867dc3;X7ab26f25c;X883e1e942;X8faf60ef5;X91d61a339;Xa1b994b71;Xb834ab51a;Xbb7ff0da8;Xbd34be847;Xcb8b3da20;Xcf3c78e2f;Xd3a53e0ce;Xd404ffb1e;Xd70cfd94d;Xdd7cccfc5;Xe03f85df6;Xe1f63eeca;Xe34af34a8;Xe908ef6dc;Xf10ddcc1f;Xfabeaae36,30,Most borrowed is most cited?

This paper describes NCore, presents and analyzes its architecture, tools and services; and reports on the experience of NSDL in building and operating a major digital library on it over the past year and the experience of the Digital Library for Earth Systems Education in porting their existing digital library and tools to the NCore platform.","Krafft, Dean B.;Birkland, Aaron;Cramer, Ellen J.",ArXiv e-prints,X0c70b20e9;X0ca931c47;X393bf8147;X3a1dc7cd5;X3fc382854;X4a466e718;X53e9bb531;X67dfbdd0f;X6fc6944d8;X75c934209;X8014d10c3;X9c1cd6823;X9d27e40b4;Xa1c758edd;Xb242d5486;Xb96ec4e59;Xda855131b;Xdb790a881;Xdc414b931,19,"NCore: Architecture and Implementation of a Flexible, Collaborative Digital Library",http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1500,2008
151,"The OAI Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) framework recasts the repository-centric notion of digital object to a bounded aggregation of Web resources. In this manner, digital library content is more integrated with the Web architecture, and thereby more accessible to Web applications and clients. This generalized notion of an aggregation that is independent of repository containment conforms more closely with notions in eScience and eScholarship, where content is distributed across multiple services and databases. We provide a motivation for the OAI-ORE project, review previous interoperability efforts, describe draft ORE specifications and report on promising results from early experimentation that illustrate improved interoperability and reuse of digital objects.","Lagoze, Carl;Van de Sompel, Herbert;Nelson, Michael L.;Warner, Simeon;Sanderson, Robert;Johnston, Pete",ArXiv e-prints,X0126ff8a4;X04effcad4;X07ed5e889;X09a2075f6;X10156991b;X1b05af524;X1c8e22322;X1e0af8799;X2237c59b9;X287d184dc;X2bf6c66bd;X32ff1ad34;X335ce4b57;X399394064;X3a17a905d;X3cf593b89;X40b9399d9;X41fc3489b;X44a37d112;X49ea7ced8;X4ab5c0d8d;X504833e8b;X56bc4660e;X62456a66c;X631df69a6;X68bcd5d96;X7616d9c86;X785816b7e;X82916e81c;X84e90684b;X8633005c7;X911264ddb;X9154a277d;X98dba6c46;X9b39d287a;X9caae366e;Xa13113a06;Xa4e700c8e;Xa5e389c9e;Xa714214a0;Xa74015ae4;Xabee567a3;Xad7eee5d7;Xb30c61bcc;Xb4bb1b3f2;Xba16463de;Xbb6dd04e0;Xbc186bd5b;Xc8a1198ad;Xc8e7133c1;Xd294b64f9;Xd3abb26be;Xd3c334205;Xd57caa708;Xd67940ceb;Xd834a063c;Xda7592bae;Xe0ab9583c;Xe248c6bb6;Xe3e541fb6;Xe7494b36c;Xe777c364a;Xe7d9a0407;Xeca4f57ae;Xedea993fa;Xf228132d1;Xf522fd9a5;Xf5708e012;Xfd971feab,69,Object Re-Use & Exchange: A Resource-Centric Approach,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2273,2008
152,"The need to federate repositories emerges in two distinctive scenarios. In one scenario, scalability-related problems in the operation of a repository reach a point beyond which continued service requires parallelization and hence federation of the repository infrastructure. In the other scenario, multiple distributed repositories manage collections of interest to certain communities or applications, and federation is an approach to present a unified perspective across these repositories. The high-level, 3-Tier aDORe federation architecture can be used as a guideline to federate repositories in both cases. This paper describes the architecture, consisting of core interfaces for federated repositories in Tier-1, two shared infrastructure components in Tier-2, and a single-point of access to the federation in Tier-3. The paper also illustrates two large-scale deployments of the aDORe federation architecture: the aDORe Archive repository (over 100,000,000 digital objects) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Ghent University Image Repository federation (multiple terabytes of image files).","Van de Sompel, Herbert;Chute, Ryan;Hochstenbach, Patrick",ArXiv e-prints,X073a3cc4f;X63792cea4;X63b18899f;Xa2a09ca75;Xbbecb7316;Xd429ca011;Xec5d568f2,7,The aDORe Federation Architecture,http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4511,2008
153,"Access to previous results is of paramount importance in the scientific process. Recent progress in information management focuses on building e-infrastructures for the optimization of the research workflow, through both policy-driven and user-pulled dynamics. For decades, High-Energy Physics (HEP) has pioneered innovative solutions in the field of information management and dissemination. In light of a transforming information environment, it is important to assess the current usage of information resources by researchers and HEP provides a unique test-bed for this assessment. A survey of about 10% of practitioners in the field reveals usage trends and information needs. Community-based services, such as the pioneering arXiv and SPIRES systems, largely answer the need of the scientists, with a limited but increasing fraction of younger users relying on Google. Commercial services offered by publishers or database vendors are essentially unused in the field. The survey offers an insight into the most important features that users require to optimize their research workflow. These results inform the future evolution of information management in HEP and, as these researchers are traditionally ``early adopters'' of innovation in scholarly communication, can inspire developments of disciplinary repositories serving other communities.","Gentil-Beccot, Anne;Mele, Salvatore;Holtkamp, Annette;O'Connell, Heath B.;Brooks, Travis C.",ArXiv e-prints,X149cd5af5;X18c327ae3;X1d90e9973;X2381e9ac1;X3c0db226a;X4677007c2;X4bdf07c02;X5f0bfcb1c;X631df69a6;X63b18899f;X677a23d92;X79b4d5cba;X7c093b4dc;X94ed06761;Xa640c6155;Xab253f316;Xb30c61bcc;Xc82900ce4;Xcd90dfa47;Xd1f30b564;Xed2ee7123;Xfdc19d8a2,22,Information Resources in High-Energy Physics: Surveying the Present Landscape and Charting the Future Course,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2701,2008

155,"With the growing significance of digital libraries and the Internet, more and more electronic texts become accessible to a wide and geographically disperse public. This requires adequate tools to facilitate indexing, storage, and retrieval of documents written in different languages. We present a method for semi-automatic indexing of electronic documents and construction of a multilingual thesaurus, which can be used for query formulation and information retrieval. We use special dictionaries and user interaction in order to solve ambiguities and find adequate canonical terms in the language and adequate abstract language-independent terms. The abstract thesaurus is updated incrementally by new indexed documents and is used to search document concerning terms in a query to the document base.","Schiel, Ulrich;Sodre Ferreira de Souza, Ianna M.;Ferneda, Edberto",ArXiv e-prints,X0de86462e;X60472fa63;X7c911385b,3,Semi-Automatic Indexing of Multilingual Documents,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902022,1999
156,"Scholarly usage data holds the potential to be used as a tool to study the dynamics of scholarship in real time, and to form the basis for the definition of novel metrics of scholarly impact. However, the formal groundwork to reliably and validly exploit usage data is lacking, and the exact nature, meaning and applicability of usage-based metrics is poorly understood. The MESUR project funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation constitutes a systematic effort to define, validate and cross-validate a range of usage-based metrics of scholarly impact. MESUR has collected nearly 1 billion usage events as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data from significant publishers, aggregators and institutional consortia to construct a large-scale usage data reference set. This paper describes some major challenges related to aggregating and processing usage data, and discusses preliminary results obtained from analyzing the MESUR reference data set.

157,"We describe steps toward an interactive directory for the town of Norfolk, Nebraska for the years 1899 and 1900. This directory would extend the traditional city directory by including a wider range of entities being described, much richer information about the entities mentioned and linkages to mentions of the entities in material such as digitized historical newspapers. Such a directory would be useful to readers who browse the historical newspapers by providing structured summaries of the entities mentioned. We describe the occurrence of entities in two years of the Norfolk Weekly News, focusing on several individuals to better understand the types of information which can be gleaned from historical newspapers and other historical materials. We also describe a prototype program which coordinates information about entities from the traditional city directories, the federal census, and from newspapers. We discuss the structured coding for these entities, noting that richer coding would increasingly include descriptions of events and scenarios. We propose that rich content about individuals and communities could eventually be modeled with agents and woven into historical narratives.","Allen, Robert B.",ArXiv e-prints,X1ac968203;X4f1c11b1a;X6a9cbde9b;X6ce11dc66;Xc5248cd1b;Xcad9a8b65;Xd48e9e83d;Xe43ba1039;Xf239f452b,9,"Toward an Interactive Directory for Norfolk, Nebraska: 1899-1900",http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5395,2013

159,We established in an earlier study that articles listed at or near the top of the daily arXiv:astro-ph mailings receive on average significantly more citations than articles further down the list. In our earlier work we were not able to decide whether this positional citation effect was due to author self-promotion of intrinsically more citable papers or whether papers are cited more often simply because they are at the top of the astro-ph listing. Using new data we can now disentangle both effects. Based on their submission times we separate articles into a self-promoted sample and a sample of articles that achieved a high rank on astro-ph by chance and compare their citation distributions with those of articles in lower astro-ph positions. We find that the positional citation effect is a superposition of self-promotion and visibility bias.,"Dietrich, J.

162,"Social bookmarking systems allow users to organise collections of resources on the Web in a collaborative fashion. The increasing popularity of these systems as well as first insights into their emergent semantics have made them relevant to disciplines like knowledge extraction and ontology learning. The problem of devising methods to measure the semantic relatedness between tags and characterizing it semantically is still largely open. Here we analyze three measures of tag relatedness: tag co-occurrence, cosine similarity of co-occurrence distributions, and FolkRank, an adaptation of the PageRank algorithm to folksonomies. Each measure is computed on tags from a large-scale dataset crawled from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us. To provide a semantic grounding of our findings, a connection to WordNet (a semantic lexicon for the English language) is established by mapping tags into synonym sets of WordNet, and applying there well-known metrics of semantic similarity. Our results clearly expose different characteristics of the selected measures of relatedness, making them applicable to different subtasks of knowledge extraction such as synonym detection or discovery of concept hierarchies.","Cattuto, Ciro;Benz, Dominik;Hotho, Andreas;Stumme, Gerd",ArXiv e-prints,X007810752;X205418ddb;X228576095;X25dc045f4;X2dc1e27a6;X2f615d818;X30e172c98;X328cc5779;X357046989;X3ba35aa1e;X4d31c0bcc;X4d3c06c63;X537e130fd;X557f541cf;X59b143af2;X5b1c4e031;X5b5ee87ad;X5c0258e7e;X5cd3aca9c;X6556eae11;X699ee97d8;X6db4ce2d7;X717e2b595;X72f6e8667;X751b0bebc;X7bc99a29f;X7bd0dccd6;X8238c8469;X85f4f0a82;X871130b2f;X87ab2c661;X8cada2bed;X8ced1b5ab;X901c40715;X92bab9631;X95aeea950;X98fbf0a53;Xa4d3c3ac1;Xa51d30ff9;Xaa5d42053;Xaa7c67341;Xaa8e4aa48;Xacb7b9b62;Xad92cb256;Xaedbb7e21;Xaf1002bc5;Xb1ec7b402;Xb49c0819a;Xb749f492d;Xb8b1e258e;Xba8eb63cf;Xbbc5be2c4;Xc284d5e59;Xc2a42245a;Xc93250fbc;Xca0605bfd;Xcd9a049fc;Xd722091f4;Xe4bffd763;Xee9906918;Xf229a5f44;Xf41d9384c;Xf52f7cf77;Xfb0d41d46,64,Semantic Analysis of Tag Similarity Measures in Collaborative Tagging Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2045,2008

In addition we show that the same universal behavior occurs when citation distributions of articles published in the same field, but in different years, are compared. These findings provide a strong validation of c<SUB>f</SUB> as an unbiased indicator for citation performance across disciplines and years. Based on this indicator, we introduce a generalization of the h index suitable for comparing scientists working in different fields.","Radicchi, Filippo;Fortunato, Santo;Castellano, Claudio",Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,54f902083a;5547e2a8de;X07c20c0b2;X120139485;X192109981;X1d454ae6d;X2baf55aeb;X36fb97a09;X37206498f;X3da6d53b9;X4c1b6d5d2;X527d043c7;X5d2f1264f;X6974142b8;X74c43a30b;X8272aa683;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;Xafc83bd12;Xb1875d7bd;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xd011d9c1b;Xd3192f135;Xda7b026af;Xdec7c7873;Xf3b223276,27,Universality of citation distributions: Toward an objective measure of scientific impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0974,2008

The scope of this study is to answer two fundamental questions: (i) can one indicate a category (i.e., a scientific discipline) that has the greatest impact on the rank of the university and (ii) do the best universities collaborate with the best ones only? Using two university ranking lists (ARWU and QS) as well as data from the Science Citation Index we show how the number of publications in certain categories correlates with the university rank. Moreover, using complex networks analysis, we give hints that the scientific collaboration is highly embedded in the physical space and the number of common papers decays with the distance between them. We also show the strength of the ties between universities is proportional to product of their total number of publications.","Sienkiewicz, Julian;Soja, Krzysztof;Holyst, Janusz A.;Sloot, Peter M.

168,"In spite of its tremendous value, metadata is generally sparse and incomplete, thereby hampering the effectiveness of digital information services. Many of the existing mechanisms for the automated creation of metadata rely primarily on content analysis which can be costly and inefficient. The automatic metadata generation system proposed in this article leverages resource relationships generated from existing metadata as a medium for propagation from metadata-rich to metadata-poor resources. Because of its independence from content analysis, it can be applied to a wide variety of resource media types and is shown to be computationally inexpensive. The proposed method operates through two distinct phases. Occurrence and co-occurrence algorithms first generate an associative network of repository resources leveraging existing repository metadata. Second, using the associative network as a substrate, metadata associated with metadata-rich resources is propagated to metadata-poor resources by means of a discrete-form spreading activation algorithm. This article discusses the general framework for building associative networks, an algorithm for disseminating metadata through such networks, and the results of an experiment and validation of the proposed method using a standard bibliographic dataset.","Rodriguez, Marko A.;Bollen, Johan;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X06e089b25;X0ea2393f3;X1d03b02e8;X3eea560ff;X47cdb8fa7;X87fa70e21;X8da862a4a;X9a4a964dc;X9a6bfde52;Xa29c4aafd;Xa3676a6bf;Xab8b8b0f1;Xb1c9832e3;Xb8d0d8ee3;Xba027f9cc;Xca20dbb99;Xd2ad4ddd5;Xe5a184235;Xeb4675ada;Xf9a37d050;Xfb8979f0d,21,Automatic Metadata Generation using Associative Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0023,2008

As the number of product reviews grows, it becomes difficult for users to search and utilize these resources in an efficient way. In this work, we build a product review summarization system that can automatically process a large collection of reviews and aggregate them to generate a concise summary. More importantly, the drawback of existing product summarization systems is that they cannot provide the underlying reasons to justify users' opinions.

Finally, the RPDM is shown to be a generalization of the Probability Ranking principle (PRP) which guarantees optimal retrieval effectiveness in the case of text document retrieval.

174,"For bounded datasets such as the TREC Web Track (WT10g) the computation of term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) is not difficult. However, when the corpus is the entire web, direct IDF calculation is impossible and values must instead be estimated. Most available datasets provide values for term count (TC) meaning the number of times a certain term occurs in the entire corpus. Intuitively this value is different from document frequency (DF), the number of documents (e.g., web pages) a certain term occurs in. We conduct a comparison study between TC and DF values within the Web as Corpus (WaC). We found a very strong correlation with Spearman's rho 〉0.8 (p〈0.005) which makes us confident in claiming that for such recently created corpora the TC and DF values can be used interchangeably to compute IDF values. These results are useful for the generation of accurate lexical signatures based on the TF-IDF scheme.","Klein, Martin;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X0af3bc1ca;X136cd3c7a;X1b174fff3;X1b854e7a2;X212c762e9;X444620764;X4e12d5608;X518a1d540;X5808f8b50;X5aa86dcb8;X67f383bd4;X76fe074a6;X7ac8bb2ae;X8c59f8cc3;X938f35cb3;Xa95cf8d86;Xaf7cd2043;Xba7939dfe;Xc81ddc664;Xd620b9b7d;Xe36068f8c;Xf6a18691e,22,Approximating Document Frequency with Term Count Values,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3755,2008

Along with the dynamics in the publication trends, one also has to take into account the dynamics of the databases used for the measurement.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X3c1538f02;X7791bb0c8;X8aca5849d;Xa68acc6e7;Xd93784e2d,5,"World Shares of Publications of the USA, EU-27, and China Compared and Predicted using the New Interface of the Web-of-Science versus Scopus",http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1802,2011
181,"In this article, we analyze the citations to articles published in 11 biological and medical journals from 2003 to 2007 that employ author-choice open access models. Controlling for known explanatory predictors of citations, only 2 of the 11 journals show positive and significant open access effects. Analyzing all journals together, we report a small but significant increase in article citations of 17%. In addition, there is strong evidence to suggest that the open access advantage is declining by about 7% per year, from 32% in 2004 to 11% in 2007.","Davis, Philip M.",ArXiv e-prints,X06fc58507;X07c20c0b2;X0970d64d1;X120139485;X1d454ae6d;X1d54a57b9;X2abb24e41;X2c2c395d8;X3da6d53b9;X4c1b6d5d2;X527d043c7;X5d2f1264f;X63b18899f;X65f6f8ec0;X6974142b8;X74c43a30b;X8249adb30;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X966331df0;Xa0ef06452;Xad8637bfc;Xafe1ea12b;Xb1875d7bd;Xb397daaa7;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xc9e6a69cf;Xcbed53df9;Xd011d9c1b;Xe5283b6b2;Xea0c1a83b;Xf3b223276,33,Author-choice open access publishing in the biological and medical literature: a citation analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2428,2008
182,"Davis (2008) analyzes citations from 2004-2007 in 11 biomedical journals. 15% of authors paid to make them Open Access (OA). The outcome is a significant OA citation Advantage, but a small one (21%). The author infers that the OA advantage has been shrinking yearly, but the data suggest the opposite. Further analyses are necessary: (1) Not just author-choice (paid) OA but Free OA self-archiving needs to be taken into account rather than being counted as non-OA. (2) proportion of OA articles per journal per year needs to be reported and taken into account. (3) The Journal Impact Factor and the relation between the size of the OA Advantage article 'citation-bracket' need to be taken into account. (4) The sample-size for the highest-impact, largest-sample journal analyzed, PNAS, is restricted and excluded from some of the analyses. The full PNAS dataset is needed. (5) The interaction between OA and time, 2004-2007, is based on retrospective data from a June 2008 total cumulative citation count. The dates of both the cited articles and the citing articles need to be taken into account. The author proposes that author self-selection bias for is the primary cause of the observed OA Advantage, but this study does not test this or of any of the other potential causal factors. The author suggests that paid OA is not worth the cost, per extra citation. But with OA self-archiving both the OA and the extra citations are free.","Harnad, Stevan",ArXiv e-prints,X019810207;X07c20c0b2;X18bff2d9d;X29d0c4198;X2a7efa9c1;X5a72e6a96;X6e9b093f7;X700cd4198;X73c64119a;X74c43a30b;X7c42e8ee0;X82f7416c2;X854b3e855;Xadd66b30a;Xe36e5e5fb;Xff4f16b69,16,Confirmation Bias and the Open Access Advantage: Some Methodological Suggestions for the Davis Citation Study,http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3296,2008
183,"Paper journals use a small number of trusted academics to select information on behalf of all their readers. This inflexibility in the selection was justified due to the expense of publishing. The advent of cheap distribution via the internet allows a new trade-off between time and expense and the flexibility of the selection process. This paper explores one such possible process one where the role of mark-up and archiving is separated from that of review. The idea is that authors publish their papers on their own web pages or in a public paper archive, a board of reviewers judge that paper on a number of different criteria. The detailed results of the reviews are stored in such a way as to enable readers to use these judgements to find the papers they want using search engines on the web. Thus instead of journals using generic selection criteria readers can set their own to suit their needs. The resulting system might be even cheaper than web-journals to implement.","Edmonds, Bruce",ArXiv e-prints,X2130cc650;X518b80d01;X83b9e0fec;X8c492e948;X90156783d;Xa29c4aafd;Xa5010ebb7;Xa83dec7cf;Xd151a424c;Xe25f1af81,10,A Proposal for the Establishment of Review Boards - a flexible approach to the selection of academic knowledge,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9904001,1999
184,"Mathematical models of the scientific citation process predict a strong ""first-mover"" effect under which the first papers in a field will, essentially regardless of content, receive citations at a rate enormously higher than papers published later. Moreover papers are expected to retain this advantage in perpetuity —they should receive more citations indefinitely, no matter how many other papers are published after them. We test this conjecture against data from a selection of fields and in several cases find a first-mover effect of a magnitude similar to that predicted by the theory. Were we wearing our cynical hat today, we might say that the scientist who wants to become famous is better off —by a wide margin— writing a modest paper in next year's hottest field than an outstanding paper in this year's. On the other hand, there are some later-published papers, albeit only a small fraction, that buck the trend and attract significantly more citations than theory predicts. We suggest that papers of this kind, though they often receive relatively few citations overall, are probably worthy of our attention.","Newman, M. E.

185,"Naively, one would expect longer papers to have larger impact (i.e., to be cited more). I tested this expectation by selecting all (~30,000) refereed papers from A&A, AJ, ApJ and MNRAS published between 2000 and 2004. These particular years were chosen so papers analyzed would not be too ""fresh"", but at the same time length of each article could be obtained via ADS. I find that indeed longer papers published in these four major astronomy journals are on average cited more, with a median number of citations increasing from 6 for articles 2-3 pages long to about 50 for articles ~50 pages long. I do however observe a significant ""Letters effect"", i.e. ApJ and A&A articles 4 pages long are cited more than articles 5-10 pages long. Also, the very few longest (〉80 pages) papers are actually cited less than somewhat shorter papers. For individual journals, median citations per paper increase from 11 for ~9,300 A&A papers to 14 for ~5,300 MNRAS papers, 16 for ~2,550 AJ papers, and 20 for ~12,850 ApJ papers (including ApJ Letters and Supplement).

186,"Social Communities in bibliographic databases exist since many years, researchers share common research interests, and work and publish together. A social community may vary in type and size, being fully connected between participating members or even more expressed by a consortium of small and individual members who play individual roles in it. In this work, we focus on social communities inside the bibliographic database DBLP and characterize communities through a simple typifying description model. Generally, we understand a publication as a transaction between the associated authors. The idea therefore is to concern with directed associative relationships among them, to decompose each pattern to its fundamental structure, and to describe the communities by expressive attributes. Finally, we argue that the decomposition supports the management of discovered structures towards the use of adaptive-incremental mind-maps.","Schommer, Christoph",ArXiv e-prints,5543b2d040;X00f3fe919;X0a9b62ecc;X0b3e26a84;X1dc0eda37;Xe449fd885;Xecc1989a1;Xfceb5bde6,8,A Simple Framework to Typify Social Bibliographic Communities,http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2818,2008
187,"In previous research it has been shown that link-based web page metrics can be used to predict experts' assessment of quality. We are interested in a related question: do expert rankings of real-world entities correlate with search engine rankings of corresponding web resources? For example, each year US News & World Report publishes a list of (among others) top 50 graduate business schools. Does their expert ranking correlate with the search engine ranking of the URLs of those business schools? To answer this question we conducted 9 experiments using 8 expert rankings on a range of academic, athletic, financial and popular culture topics. We compared the expert rankings with the rankings in Google, Live Search (formerly MSN) and Yahoo (with list lengths of 10, 25, and 50). In 57 search engine vs. expert comparisons, only 1 strong and 4 moderate correlations were statistically significant. In 42 inter-search engine comparisons, only 2 strong and 4 moderate correlations were statistically significant. The correlations appeared to decrease with the size of the lists: the 3 strong correlations were for lists of 10, the 8 moderate correlations were for lists of 25, and no correlations were found for lists of 50.","Nelson, Michael L.;Klein, Martin;Magudamudi, Manoranjan",ArXiv e-prints,X30cd2689b;X55655d14f;X57652cb75;X7148ad8a9;X8c1b2ba5d;Xb8ca1cedf;Xbe326a77e;Xbfa14f9f3;Xc2fff1b33;Xc71290522;Xc98471d54;Xd247a0029;Xe426b5399;Xe4706134e,14,Correlation of Expert and Search Engine Rankings,http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2851,2008
188,"This paper challenges recent research (Evans, 2008) reporting that the concentration of cited scientific literature increases with the online availability of articles and journals. Using Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, the present paper analyses changes in the concentration of citations received (two- and five-year citation windows) by papers published between 1900 and 2005. Three measures of concentration are used: the percentage of papers that received at least one citation (cited papers); the percentage of papers needed to account for 20, 50 and 80 percent of the citations; and, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. These measures are used for four broad disciplines: natural sciences and engineering, medical fields, social sciences, and the humanities. All these measures converge and show that, contrary to what was reported by Evans, the dispersion of citations is actually increasing.","Lariviere, Vincent;Gingras, Yves;Archambault, Eric",ArXiv e-prints,X00b5ebbe0;X00bd80b2c;X034643709;X039fa9f7c;X03ab63edf;X048299ba0;X0719216f9;X07500cef4;X07c20c0b2;X07c370ac1;X08537be94;X09a018eb4;X0a9d075a7;X0acb8f40c;X0b0195cb1;X0bb577a13;X0c1afb823;X0c8b723e4;X0f8409f94;X104f4fe07;X1071d5b34;X10e22d33d;X12469c807;X12622ba19;X1423a4786;X14c0a587f;X152874652;X156099c13;X1584e1557;X15b8c1354;X15d9975ee;X172d0cf13;X183cd3279;X1858237be;X18c72c0d4;X19ac28571;X1a291c9ba;X1a7040cf5;X1bd13d752;X1bf5b046f;X1c48984b1;X1d299d545;X1d54a57b9;X1e25e1cc3;X1e732dbdd;X21c60383c;X247350495;X24817c287;X258f767fa;X260607673;X2788bd50b;X29b00f4ac;X2abb24e41;X2ae3f6395;X2baf55aeb;X2c47d1fb0;X2e6abe8ad;X2f15d4a4c;X300ec6a91;X30420f0c7;X308037738;X3135cbc4a;X314b04e67;X31f8fedc6;X31ffc89f9;X321babb92;X327524347;X354db9643;X3595416a6;X35a1aa6d7;X35bd5f2c0;X3616ca0b2;X36eb62ef2;X3731f6811;X3a489729c;X3bdbd83cb;X3bf77726d;X3c860dabd;X3da6d53b9;X3ebb18fd8;X433f1a2ec;X446af39cc;X44b19e1e9;X4641bc053;X4699a167c;X47259a817;X4802ce89c;X483a0cf42;X487ef8bc4;X48c517c93;X4a9ca096b;X4b906d55f;X4c1b6d5d2;X4d1e3608a;X4d8baa74f;X51e80a48d;X527d043c7;X52bc123a0;X537a32e4a;X549e72599;X558b2292e;X55b79053b;X579f04b26;X59f1b34dd;X5a75778f8;X5cacc23cf;X5ccf42077;X5ce30b365;X5d2f1264f;X5e0f25559;X5e8e60a45;X5ff974c5b;X609dc2f44;X6389a6131;X63b18899f;X63d7f344f;X63e306d71;X64609428c;X6480642ee;X67071b648;X673aad474;X674531e05;X6861f88e7;X687e64333;X6974142b8;X698b49cb3;X69e140b5b;X6b074d6ea;X6c8258b96;X6cefeffe6;X6e0bacdc6;X6e9975bb8;X6f6fab0c7;X6f860dc97;X6faa142c2;X6fb18d711;X701f08843;X73dc8dd6a;X74c43a30b;X7614d94f8;X762d5242e;X7719fd972;X7c25f27b0;X7c33b193e;X7c5769139;X7d06642aa;X7e8d13e6c;X7eb538719;X7fba2d264;X80469eb3b;X811c2d331;X8249adb30;X82b0904d4;X832b5d512;X841c1eca4;X85311c7a7;X85c99f360;X86c487c6e;X87f086db7;X8972963ac;X898d74472;X8ab040701;X8afa48272;X8c512476b;X8db83bf2d;X8f9976612;X90ab5e02d;X90cdde8cc;X90dd07739;X9156758d1;X92393256d;X92fdd3fbb;X936eea278;X93ce5682b;X9436333ed;X946c1c8a9;X9501a8730;X988eb1e31;X9a0a78397;X9a99fd49e;X9c3d74435;X9d1ed13b2;X9d437c9a7;X9d91a0fde;X9e981ace0;X9f99a1729;X9fe21a6c2;X9ff0a4a55;Xa0ef06452;Xa1b994b71;Xa1ded0245;Xa2119a335;Xa243a22de;Xa2b555a5c;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa418d1dc6;Xa4a8ac029;Xa5c250b69;Xa70a2f780;Xa82a3882d;Xa8f212615;Xa98cbaa88;Xa9fbf62bb;Xabf3b5719;Xace0f4f56;Xad542cd1f;Xada74b3a2;Xb0a546c41;Xb1875d7bd;Xb2610a404;Xb27203f2d;Xb2c1a4ce1;Xb4b4ea980;Xb65298441;Xb6fc8f8a3;Xb77bdf04b;Xb86bdf63c;Xb89485e0a;Xb9ede2f83;Xba067c74b;Xba8211e3c;Xba9e90876;Xbc18612c1;Xbdf3d7891;Xbf65e73af;Xbf6ec7d80;Xbf8d07581;Xc06e9427b;Xc0d2dc06d;Xc19b01685;Xc1cf9caf1;Xc21ec7def;Xc285b873d;Xc337aa09c;Xc369f5355;Xc3e30e1d9;Xc3eb63bac;Xc501ad0de;Xc6b8fa295;Xc9a6d0a88;Xc9c2aac95;Xcad0a3610;Xccd54915f;Xce49cd806;Xced304153;Xcefb8c33f;Xcfb565137;Xcfbbe7c0b;Xd011d9c1b;Xd047087d3;Xd0f201c31;Xd1069a247;Xd117bc11f;Xd14cd99e6;Xd221d4d07;Xd2b4854fd;Xd339a4108;Xd3453b8ee;Xd558e172c;Xd5e6d2650;Xd710b8420;Xd880a93ea;Xd8ae63a44;Xd9f44a5cb;Xda7b026af;Xda80d27d9;Xdaa1bda31;Xdaef658f3;Xdc4dca7f9;Xdc62e6de3;Xdc811ad07;Xdc845a3f1;Xdc89eddd4;Xddc02aa77;Xdf99f4738;Xdff9acff5;Xe0c06d959;Xe0e445cc3;Xe16fef4a3;Xe221007e7;Xe2723d1f6;Xe2adc90e6;Xe34437f40;Xe51e869bc;Xe5283b6b2;Xe5639abbc;Xe5a59b94b;Xe8e333caf;Xe9636e480;Xe9ae5e02f;Xe9c6e1df4;Xea0c1a83b;Xeae043e66;Xec02a9f7d;Xecf11f335;Xed00377a4;Xee268b7d7;Xee7b2c78d;Xf305b04a0;Xf3b223276;Xf3ccd1147;Xf3da8ae23;Xf53de153f;Xf5a83abcf;Xf7626990a;Xf774774a7;Xf7f1ecd04;Xf8fb72f9d;Xfacf3bc21;Xfbb91998d;Xfc2c8d970;Xfcc37108e;Xfd972ca41;Xfdc024b57;Xff00f39be;Xff4189165;Xff4f16b69;Xff9af565c,318,"The decline in the concentration of citations, 1900-2007",http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.5250,2008

In this work we present a framework that is a first step towards an automatic intellect. It aims at assembling a mind-map based on incoming text streams and on a subject-verb-object strategy, having the verb as an interconnection between the adjacent nouns.

191,"Citation distributions are crucial for the analysis and modeling of the activity of scientists. We investigated bibliometric data of papers published in journals of the American Physical Society, searching for the type of function which best describes the observed citation distributions. We used the goodness of fit with Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics for three classes of functions: log-normal, simple power law and shifted power law. The shifted power law turns out to be the most reliable hypothesis for all citation networks we derived, which correspond to different time spans. We find that citation dynamics is characterized by bursts, usually occurring within a few years since publication of a paper, and the burst size spans several orders of magnitude. We also investigated the microscopic mechanisms for the evolution of citation networks, by proposing a linear preferential attachment with time dependent initial attractiveness. The model successfully reproduces the empirical citation distributions and accounts for the presence of citation bursts as well.","Eom, Young-Ho;Fortunato, Santo",PLoS ONE,X1ca5a6eac;X4b718d925;X58fef0b7c;X7e03c067e;X8be900863;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xd25ddc9c2;Xe47525a5f;Xe900aa7a2,9,Characterizing and Modeling Citation Dynamics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2153,2011
192,"Knowledge plays a central role in human and artificial intelligence. One of the key characteristics of knowledge is its structured organization. Knowledge can be and should be presented in multiple levels and multiple views to meet people's needs in different levels of granularities and from different perspectives. In this paper, we stand on the view point of granular computing and provide our understanding on multi-level and multi-view of knowledge through granular knowledge structures (GKS). Representation of granular knowledge structures, operations for building granular knowledge structures and how to use them are investigated. As an illustration, we provide some examples through results from an analysis of proceeding papers. Results show that granular knowledge structures could help users get better understanding of the knowledge source from set theoretical, logical and visual point of views. One may consider using them to meet specific needs or solve certain kinds of problems.","Zeng, Yi;Zhong, Ning",ArXiv e-prints,X0a00ce021;X16311f4e2;X195a42058;X3d35c9322;X5f159e6ac;X7126c3bad;X88b97a688;X94ae95c2c;Xad02352e6;Xb1ec7b402;Xb68c8c8c7;Xcae011d8b,12,On Granular Knowledge Structures,http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4668,2008
193,"The field of digital libraries (DLs) coalesced in 1994: the first digital library conferences were held that year, awareness of the World Wide Web was accelerating, and the National Science Foundation awarded $24 Million (U.S.) for the Digital Library Initiative (DLI). In this paper we examine the state of the DL domain after a decade of activity by applying social network analysis to the co-authorship network of the past ACM, IEEE, and joint ACM/IEEE digital library conferences. We base our analysis on a common binary undirectional network model to represent the co-authorship network, and from it we extract several established network measures. We also introduce a weighted directional network model to represent the co-authorship network, for which we define $AuthorRank$ as an indicator of the impact of an individual author in the network. The results are validated against conference program committee members in the same period. The results show clear advantages of PageRank and AuthorRank over degree, closeness and betweenness centrality metrics. We also investigate the amount and nature of international participation in Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL).","Liu, Xiaoming;Bollen, Johan;Nelson, Michael L.;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X00cfd6f15;X037113bb8;X04effcad4;X096e29ec8;X0a5173110;X10a9d2e17;X127911863;X1a487e9e6;X1ce8dfaf0;X1d2a57d2c;X1dd6ca8fd;X1e51cb84c;X2106b51af;X22d51a6e1;X23c2eb3bd;X23c5012b5;X25c402481;X2625d1d99;X262e32a3c;X29fdbc44a;X2f1af9fe6;X342b84c12;X365944fe5;X3cd2b8939;X3ce0ec11f;X3e1b9b1ea;X407b2d655;X421c5de6d;X429d576fd;X472f214e4;X4b6c99d91;X4ccb5d744;X549d565c3;X590772397;X5a29b23cc;X5ac33f232;X5af1139c6;X5ccae28d6;X664a187c7;X6d3d234f9;X6d7553b49;X6f4eb776a;X6fcaa75fe;X770a45bf9;X790af133f;X791a5889a;X7a46e50f4;X80e641741;X82f52bb9f;X86192d83d;X891f627ba;X90fbe5297;X91ca0a389;X9226bc074;X9770689ab;X99e69e25c;X9ac32b565;X9e4258bf5;X9fd8358df;Xa8a0eff8c;Xa8bd8433a;Xa97d4ba10;Xaf20d1ffb;Xaf95f0a06;Xb0b8b0e7a;Xb0ba8b030;Xb2906d5e0;Xb3fdfb4b2;Xbadf6241d;Xbb1f6e0c0;Xbd90f50f6;Xc018f4cbe;Xc4ffa59ab;Xc6a8c2d1d;Xc81e3f0f9;Xca719cf0a;Xcb8b4991f;Xd255aff08;Xd3abb26be;Xd4131de99;Xd47aa7829;Xd5b996154;Xd823dd2fe;Xdc7c05e43;Xde2b283ae;Xdee62e803;Xe18e6fcba;Xe39b99166;Xe567b058d;Xea0f3aa9a;Xecadc59fc;Xf089a3703;Xf16149a59;Xf6ecf3029;Xf770a5cfe;Xf9b0db070;Xfcd63d713,97,Co-Authorship Networks in the Digital Library Research Community,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0502056,2005

The proposed approach is based on the paradigm of multiple viewpoint data analysis (MVDA) than can be fruitfully exploited to highlight relationships between data, like websites, carrying several kinds of description. It uses the MultiSOM clustering and mapping method. The domain that has been chosen for this study is the domain of Computer Science in Germany. The analysis is conduced on a set of 438 websites of this domain using all together, thematic, geographic and linking information. It highlights interesting results concerning both global and local linking behaviour.","François, Claire;Lamirel, Jean-Charles;Shehabi, Shadi Al",ArXiv e-prints,X543c7ff1f;X74c1e3117;X9cd9c1f28;Xe144b97ea,4,Combining Advanced Visualization and Automatized Reasoning for Webometrics: A Test Study,http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5057,2008

196,"The next-generation astronomy digital archives will cover most of the universe at fine resolution in many wave-lengths, from X-rays to ultraviolet, optical, and infrared. The archives will be stored at diverse geographical locations. One of the first of these projects, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will create a 5-wavelength catalog over 10,000 square degrees of the sky (see http://www.sdss.org/). The 200 million objects in the multi-terabyte database will have mostly numerical attributes, defining a space of 100+ dimensions. Points in this space have highly correlated distributions. The archive will enable astronomers to explore the data interactively. Data access will be aided by a multidimensional spatial index and other indices. The data will be partitioned in many ways. Small tag objects consisting of the most popular attributes speed up frequent searches. Splitting the data among multiple servers enables parallel, scalable I/O and applies parallel processing to the data. Hashing techniques allow efficient clustering and pair-wise comparison algorithms that parallelize nicely. Randomly sampled subsets allow debugging otherwise large queries at the desktop. Central servers will operate a data pump that supports sweeping searches that touch most of the data. The anticipated queries require special operators related to angular distances and complex similarity tests of object properties, like shapes, colors, velocity vectors, or temporal behaviors. These issues pose interesting data management challenges.","Szalay, Alexander S.;Kunszt, Peter;Thakar, Ani;Gray, Jim",ArXiv e-prints,55159dc572;X07f4396cc;X094d7d24d;X15fb740c3;X62354db43;X6a1cb845b;X6f8ed2470;X77b323001;X8795d0f0b;X957ea7ea0;X9b2b27f68;Xc44fe0924;Xcead4aa69;Xf106f413d,14,Designing and Mining Multi-Terabyte Astronomy Archives: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907009,1999

202,"The purpose of this paper is to apply and evaluate the bibliometric method Bradfordizing for information retrieval (IR) experiments. Bradfordizing is used for generating core document sets for subject-specific questions and to reorder result sets from distributed searches. The method will be applied and tested in a controlled scenario of scientific literature databases from social and political sciences, economics, psychology and medical science (SOLIS, SoLit, USB Koeln Opac, CSA Sociological Abstracts, World Affairs Online, Psyndex and Medline) and 164 standardized topics. An evaluation of the method and its effects is carried out in two laboratory-based information retrieval experiments (CLEF and KoMoHe) using a controlled document corpus and human relevance assessments. The results show that Bradfordizing is a very robust method for re-ranking the main document types (journal articles and monographs) in today's digital libraries (DL). The IR tests show that relevance distributions after re-ranking improve at a significant level if articles in the core are compared with articles in the succeeding zones. The items in the core are significantly more often assessed as relevant, than items in zone 2 (z2) or zone 3 (z3). The improvements between the zones are statistically significant based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired T-Test.","Mayr, Philipp",ArXiv e-prints,X413faa55f;X6174d3de0;Xd705a151d,3,An evaluation of Bradfordizing effects,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0262,2008

204,"The great importance international rankings have achieved in the research policy arena warns against many threats consequence of the flaws and shortcomings these tools present. One of them has to do with the inability to accurately represent national university systems as their original purpose is only to rank world-class universities. Another one has to do with the lack of representativeness of universities' disciplinary profiles as they usually provide a unique table. Although some rankings offer a great coverage and others offer league tables by fields, no international ranking does both. In order to surpass such limitation from a research policy viewpoint, this paper analyzes the possibility of using national rankings in order to complement international rankings. For this, we analyze the Spanish university system as a study case presenting the I-UGR Rankings for Spanish universities by fields and subfields. Then, we compare their results with those obtained by the Shanghai Ranking, the QS Ranking, the Leiden Ranking and the NTU Ranking, as they all have basic common grounds which allow such comparison. We conclude that it is advisable to use national rankings in order to complement international rankings, however we observe that this must be done with certain caution as they differ on the methodology employed as well as on the construction of the fields.","Robinson-García, Nicolás;Torres-Salinas, Daniel;Delgado López-Cózar, Emilio;Herrera, Francisco",ArXiv e-prints,X037c27590;X14c6ba95a;X1eefe6e64;X219b3f31b;X22cd947c1;X262ef7a99;X28d2a2065;X29934ea08;X2e515c807;X2e8196a57;X2eb741405;X2f60be3e6;X30c2d0e01;X30d8a4c1e;X43175826a;X488b7e67c;X4ba90cf93;X5891891ba;X820f87d41;X8900c0e43;X8e28e18c7;X8f9b48280;X90ccfed92;Xa6951750c;Xa83f3cfba;Xb056d2d2e;Xb19d4a894;Xb5384fe70;Xc38920d0a;Xc704a7695;Xd2e430eb4;Xd80f94451;Xfd9ac57f6,33,An insight into the importance of national university rankings in an international context: The case of the I-UGR Rankings of Spanish universities,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1216,2013
205,"When a group of individuals creates something, credit is usually divided among them. Oddly, that does not apply to scientific papers. The most commonly used performance measure for individual researchers is the h-index, which does not correct for multi-authorship. Each author claims full credit for each paper and each ensuing citation. This mismeasure of achievement is fuelling a flagrant increase in multi-authorship.

207,"In this work we have studied the research activity for countries of Europe, Latin America and Africa for all sciences between 1945 and November 2008. All the data are captured from the Web of Science database during this period. The analysis of the experimental data shows that, within a nonextensive thermostatistical formalism, the Tsallis \emph{q}-exponential distribution $N(c)$ satisfactorily describes Institute of Scientific Information citations. The data which are examined in the present survey can be fitted successfully as a first approach by applying a {\it single} curve (namely, $N(c) \propto 1/[1+(q-1) c/T]^{\frac{1}{q-1}}$ with $q\simeq 4/3$ for {\it all} the available citations $c$, $T$ being an ""effective temperature"". The present analysis ultimately suggests that the phenomenon might essentially be {\it one and the same} along the {\it entire} range of the citation number. Finally, this manuscript provides a new ranking index, via the ""effective temperature"" $T$, for the impact level of the research activity in these countries, taking into account the number of the publications and their citations.","Anastasiadis, A.

208,"The aggregated journal-journal citation matrix -based on the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) of the Science Citation Index- can be decomposed by indexers and/or algorithmically. In this study, we test the results of two recently available algorithms for the decomposition of large matrices against two content-based classifications of journals: the ISI Subject Categories and the field/subfield classification of Glaenzel & Schubert (2003). The content-based schemes allow for the attribution of more than a single category to a journal, whereas the algorithms maximize the ratio of within-category citations over between-category citations in the aggregated category-category citation matrix. By adding categories, indexers generate between-category citations, which may enrich the database, for example, in the case of inter-disciplinary developments. The consequent indexer effects are significant in sparse areas of the matrix more than in denser ones. Algorithmic decompositions, on the other hand, are more heavily skewed towards a relatively small number of categories, while this is deliberately counter-acted upon in the case of content-based classifications. Because of the indexer effects, science policy studies and the sociology of science should be careful when using content-based classifications, which are made for bibliographic disclosure, and not for the purpose of analyzing latent structures in scientific communications. Despite the large differences among them, the four classification schemes enable us to generate surprisingly similar maps of science at the global level. Erroneous classifications are cancelled as noise at the aggregate level, but may disturb the evaluation locally.","Rafols, Ismael;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X50fe45558;X9a86fb3f0;Xa0c2ee11d;Xa1b994b71;Xa2dcdc02e;Xa70ee2c98;Xb50e05f0b;Xdb9e3a6a7,8,Content-based and Algorithmic Classifications of Journals: Perspectives on the Dynamics of Scientific Communication and Indexer Effects,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4332,2008

211,"The ideals of the eighteenth century's Age of Enlightenment are the foundation of modern democracies. The era was characterized by thinkers who promoted progressive social reforms that opposed the long-established aristocracies and monarchies of the time. Prominent examples of such reforms include the establishment of inalienable human rights, self-governing republics, and market capitalism. Twenty-first century democratic nations can benefit from revisiting the systems developed during the Enlightenment and reframing them within the techno-social context of the Information Age. This article explores the application of social algorithms that make use of Thomas Paine's (English: 1737--1809) representatives, Adam Smith's (Scottish: 1723--1790) self-interested actors, and Marquis de Condorcet's (French: 1743--1794) optimal decision making groups.

212,"Maps are an important source of information in archaeology and other sciences. Users want to search for historical maps to determine recorded history of the political geography of regions at different eras, to find out where exactly archaeological artifacts were discovered, etc. Currently, they have to use a generic search engine and add the term map along with other keywords to search for maps. This crude method will generate a significant number of false positives that the user will need to cull through to get the desired results. To reduce their manual effort, we propose an automatic map identification, indexing, and retrieval system that enables users to search and retrieve maps appearing in a large corpus of digital documents using simple keyword queries. We identify features that can help in distinguishing maps from other figures in digital documents and show how a Support-Vector-Machine-based classifier can be used to identify maps. We propose map-level-metadata e.g., captions, references to the maps in text, etc. and document-level metadata, e.g., title, abstract, citations, how recent the publication is, etc. and show how they can be automatically extracted and indexed. Our novel ranking algorithm weights different metadata fields differently and also uses the document-level metadata to help rank retrieved maps. Empirical evaluations show which features should be selected and which metadata fields should be weighted more. We also demonstrate improved retrieval results in comparison to adaptations of existing methods for map retrieval. Our map search engine has been deployed in an online map-search system that is part of the Blind-Review digital library system.","Tan, Qingzhao;Mitra, Prasenjit;Giles, C.

216,"The impact of scientific publications has traditionally been expressed in terms of citation counts. However, scientific activity has moved online over the past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data. Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution.","Bollen, Johan;Van de Sompel, Herbert;Hagberg, Aric;Chute, Ryan",PLoS ONE,5547e216a1;X035d86ac7;X07c20c0b2;X0d59cf082;X1b428b7a5;X1cd3ad125;X1d54a57b9;X2143a92f3;X2abb24e41;X330aeabb0;X348814447;X37206498f;X3c951af80;X3da6d53b9;X3ebb18fd8;X405200523;X427baf1c6;X43331d59d;X43c068ff3;X474eabd81;X48221d263;X4c1b6d5d2;X527d043c7;X54ef4f97b;X56eb90aab;X5d2f1264f;X63b18899f;X666d4780f;X6974142b8;X7173d5b21;X741a9561b;X74c43a30b;X8249adb30;X82d8f76f8;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X8bee7948f;X90c5fe842;X9156758d1;X936bff234;Xa37748b0d;Xafc83bd12;Xb0d6e745b;Xb1875d7bd;Xb2c96766f;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xd011d9c1b;Xe5283b6b2;Xed5d1a258;Xf3b223276;Xfce4d2275;Xfe2ceba1f;Xfe38d5ab7,54,A Principal Component Analysis of 39 Scientific Impact Measures,http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2183,2009

Annotation of multimedia data provides an opportunity for making the semantics explicit and facilitates the searching of multimedia documents. We have developed OntoELAN, an ontology-based linguistic multimedia annotator that features: (1) support for loading and displaying ontologies specified in OWL; (2) creation of a language profile, which allows a user to choose a subset of terms from an ontology and conveniently rename them if needed; (3) creation of ontological tiers, which can be annotated with profile terms and, therefore, corresponding ontological terms; and (4) saving annotations in the XML format as Multimedia Ontology class instances and, linked to them, class instances of other ontologies used in ontological tiers.

219,"There is an increasing interest and effort in preserving and documenting endangered languages. Language data are valuable only when they are well-cataloged, indexed and searchable. Many language data, particularly those of lesser-spoken languages, are collected as audio and video recordings. While multimedia data provide more channels and dimensions to describe a language's function, and gives a better presentation of the cultural system associated with the language of that community, they are not text-based or structured (in binary format), and their semantics is implicit in their content. The content is thus easy for a human being to understand, but difficult for computers to interpret.

221,"In the last few years we have witnessed the emergence, primarily in online communities, of new types of social networks that require for their representation more complex graph structures than have been employed in the past. One example is the folksonomy, a tripartite structure of users, resources, and tags—labels collaboratively applied by the users to the resources in order to impart meaningful structure on an otherwise undifferentiated database. Here we propose a mathematical model of such tripartite structures that represents them as random hypergraphs. We show that it is possible to calculate many properties of this model exactly in the limit of large network size and we compare the results against observations of a real folksonomy, that of the online photography website Flickr.

Traditional information retrieval evaluation techniques may not provide reliable results when applied to the Web search tools.

It explores the effects that replication can have on transforming unreliable results from one iteration into replicable and therefore reliable results after multiple iterations.","Nicholson, Scott",ArXiv e-prints,X40d761bf2;Xbc917f283;Xdd7be1e1e,3,Raising Reliability of Web Search Tool Research through Replication and Chaos Theory,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907042,1999
223,"The Hirsch h-index is now widely used as a metric to compare individual researchers. To evaluate it in the context of Australian astronomy, the h-index for every member of the Astronomical Society of Australia (ASA) is found using NASA's Astrophysics Data System Bibliographic Services. Percentiles of the h-index distribution are detailed for a variety of categories of ASA members, including students. This enables a list of the top ten Australian researchers by h-index to be produced. These top researchers have h-index values in the range 53〈h〈77, which is less than that recently reported for the American Astronomical Society membership. We suggest that membership of extremely large consortia such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey may partially explain the difference. We further suggest that many student ASA members with large h-index values have probably already received their Ph.D. and need to upgrade their ASA membership status. To attempt to specify the h-index distribution relative to opportunity, we also detail the percentiles of its distribution by years since Ph.D. award date. This shows a steady increase in h-index with seniority, as can be expected.","Pimbblet, Kevin A.",Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia,45aef5ca60;465dc3fb1a;4c0822a9a3;4f7d531100;516f52729e;5289526256;532c43365b;534f5706ae;54069fae00;54bddb94c2;54cb16a7b0;54ce6ff561;54d396f640;54d8bdca4e;54d9c4d19a;54e33bcf12;54e3c23b5c;54e6603659;552d8612bc;X063fe6a65;X0fe2f1350;X11ba3ea66;X19acd555f;X1a35dc956;X1a7a6cf8b;X1f845bf62;X241ccc92d;X24204ce7d;X2e85eb591;X3611c66be;X51f96b441;X56c032d55;X59f3ef464;X5a2041a09;X6b161e37c;X761e708ec;X7eee05453;X8af9416ad;X8b8526095;X8d8b8dbe5;X902ad5259;X9b70288de;X9e5b44a92;Xa18230c42;Xa830d7d56;Xadd95d85e;Xaf6c082d6;Xaf71fa9d7;Xb90470f71;Xc369f5355;Xc557faa3e;Xcb2d93431;Xd12336923;Xd8ced58fb;Xd97b43b70;Xdb620861f;Xdd7a7f0d9;Xde4a9b3a0;Xf5bd40026,59,The h-index in Australian Astronomy,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3130,2011
224,"Humans have the ability to regcognize the real world from different facets. Faceted exploration is a mechanism for browsing and understanding large-scale resources in information network by multiple facets. This paper proposes an Emerging Resource Space Model, whose schema is a partially ordered set of concepts with subclassOf relation and each resource is categorized by multiple concepts. Emering Resource Space (ERS) is a class of resources characterized by a concept set. ERSes compose a lattice (ERSL) via concept association. A series of exploration operations is proposed to guide users to explore through ERSL with more demanding and richer semantics than current faceted navigation. To fulfill instant response during faceted exploration, we devise an efficient algorithm for mining and indexing ERSL. The proposed model can effectively support faceted exploration in various applications from personal information management to large-scale information sharing.","Zhuge, H.;He, C.",ArXiv e-prints,X1c5d1fefd;X3b4060d2d;X971f96de7;Xa70ee2c98;Xda92c21cf;Xf37f3b68b,6,Faceted Exploration of Emerging Resource Spaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1680,2009

Two PACS numbers are linked if there exist publications that reference them simultaneously.

The communities we identify map to known scientific fields, and their age depends on their size and activity.

229,"For more than 40 years, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI, now part of Thomson Reuters) produced the only available bibliographic databases from which bibliometricians could compile large-scale bibliometric indicators. ISI's citation indexes, now regrouped under the Web of Science (WoS), were the major sources of bibliometric data until 2004, when Scopus was launched by the publisher Reed Elsevier. For those who perform bibliometric analyses and comparisons of countries or institutions, the existence of these two major databases raises the important question of the comparability and stability of statistics obtained from different data sources. This paper uses macro-level bibliometric indicators to compare results obtained from the WoS and Scopus. It shows that the correlations between the measures obtained with both databases for the number of papers and the number of citations received by countries, as well as for their ranks, are extremely high (R2 〉 .99). There is also a very high correlation when countries' papers are broken down by field. The paper thus provides evidence that indicators of scientific production and citations at the country level are stable and largely independent of the database.","Archambault, Eric;Campbell, David;Gingras, Yves;Lariviere, Vincent",ArXiv e-prints,X0842cf09a;X0ab9c116a;X1c90e0a74;X25e40953d;X2b1fbe681;X30d6a9e01;X445513b76;X54c2a1ab5;X5a04023e5;X6493ce3cb;X65cf19689;X6ee115473;X76b2432b3;X76f7a1426;X793c1fd88;X84147ee15;X87890544d;X8df5f92fb;X8eb83c917;X8f03c3a0a;X9917452c8;X99e6efb2c;Xa0ef06452;Xa1b994b71;Xa1bd372c7;Xb8ab7c601;Xc4ffa59ab;Xca93aaa72;Xcaaa91bca;Xd05b9253b;Xd6727651f;Xdb9e3a6a7;Xefa99e201;Xf479c6315,34,Comparing Bibliometric Statistics Obtained from the Web of Science and Scopus,http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.5254,2009
230,"The aim of this report is to present a ranking of Nursing journals covered in Google Scholar Metrics (GSM), a Google product launched in 2012 to assess the impact of scientific journals from citation counts this receive on Google Scholar. Google has chosen to include only those journals that have published at least 100 papers and have at least one citation in a period of five years (2007-2011). Journal rankings are sorted by languages (showing the 100 papers with the greatest impact). This tool allows to sort by subject areas and disciplines, but only in the case of journals in English. In this case, it only shows the 20 journals with the highest h index. This option is not available for journals in the other nine languages present in Google (Chinese, Portuguese, German, Spanish, French, Korean, Japanese, Dutch and Italian). Google Scholar Metrics doesnt currently allow to group and sort all journals belonging to a scientific discipline. In the case of Nursing, in the ten listings displayed by GSM we can only locate 34 journals. Therefore, in an attempt to overcome this limitation, we have used the diversity of search procedures allowed by GSM to identify the greatest number of scientific journals of Nursing with h index calculated by this bibliometric tool. Bibliographic searches were conducted between 10th and 30th May 2013. The result is a ranking of 337 nursing journals sorted by the same h index, and mean as discriminating value.

As a consequence, all metadata required to interpret the tabular data are stored in the same file, allowing for the automated generation of publication-ready tables and graphs and the semantic searchability of data file collections. The Full-Metadata Format is introduced on the basis of three comprehensive examples.

233,"The number of researchers, articles, journals, conferences, funding opportunities, and other such scholarly resources continues to grow every year and at an increasing rate. Many services have emerged to support scholars in navigating particular aspects of this resource-rich environment. Some commercial publishers provide recommender and alert services for the articles and journals in their digital libraries. Similarly, numerous noncommercial social bookmarking services have emerged for citation sharing. While these services do provide some support, they lack an understanding of the various problem-solving scenarios that researchers face daily. Example scenarios, to name a few, include when a scholar is in search of an article related to another article of interest, when a scholar is in search of a potential collaborator for a funding opportunity, when a scholar is in search of an optimal venue to which to submit their article, and when a scholar, in the role of an editor, is in search of referees to review an article. All of these example scenarios can be represented as a problem in information filtering by means of context-sensitive recommendation.

234,"Blogs have recently become one of the most favored services on the Web. Many users maintain a blog and write posts to express their opinion, experience and knowledge about a product, an event and every subject of general or specific interest. More users visit blogs to read these posts and comment them. This ""participatory journalism"" of blogs has such an impact upon the masses that Keller and Berry argued that through blogging ""one American in tens tells the other nine how to vote, where to eat and what to buy"" \cite{keller1}. Therefore, a significant issue is how to identify such influential bloggers. This problem is very new and the relevant literature lacks sophisticated solutions, but most importantly these solutions have not taken into account temporal aspects for identifying influential bloggers, even though the time is the most critical aspect of the Blogosphere. This article investigates the issue of identifying influential bloggers by proposing two easily computed blogger ranking methods, which incorporate temporal aspects of the blogging activity. Each method is based on a specific metric to score the blogger's posts. The first metric, termed MEIBI, takes into consideration the number of the blog post's inlinks and its comments, along with the publication date of the post. The second metric, MEIBIX, is used to score a blog post according to the number and age of the blog post's inlinks and its comments. These methods are evaluated against the state-of-the-art influential blogger identification method utilizing data collected from a real-world community blog site. The obtained results attest that the new methods are able to better identify significant temporal patterns in the blogging behaviour.","Akritidis, Leonidas;Katsaros, Dimitrios;Bozanis, Panayiotis",ArXiv e-prints,X05db0eee3;X135e8272b;X2f26935e5;X32ed5c508;X4cc737cb8;X4d061d002;X546c9c37a;X5a2acfde7;X744d84b05;X8e8bb2c6d;X9d05cfc6d;Xc13b76cf6;Xc1fb53896;Xc25e17f3a,14,Identifying Influential Bloggers: Time Does Matter,http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2416,2009

We study the structural features of the information paths through the citation networks of publications in computer science, and analyze the impact of various citation choices on the subsequent impact of the article. We find that citing recent papers and papers within the same scholarly community garners a slightly larger number of citations on average.

237,"The emerging Web of Data utilizes the web infrastructure to represent and interrelate data. The foundational standards of the Web of Data include the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). URIs are used to identify resources and RDF is used to relate resources. While RDF has been posited as a logic language designed specifically for knowledge representation and reasoning, it is more generally useful if it can conveniently support other models of computing. In order to realize the Web of Data as a general-purpose medium for storing and processing the world's data, it is necessary to separate RDF from its logic language legacy and frame it simply as a data model. Moreover, there is significant advantage in seeing the Semantic Web as a particular interpretation of the Web of Data that is focused specifically on knowledge representation and reasoning. By doing so, other interpretations of the Web of Data are exposed that realize RDF in different capacities and in support of different computing models.","Rodriguez, Marko A.",ArXiv e-prints,X04effcad4;X1101032db;X24eef09d3;X255c61c3e;X3042539d0;X61d044a0b;X633e536b0;X77b75b6a0;X81f206011;X9a6bfde52;Xa8b697a3d;Xaf0b6a077;Xc25e17f3a;Xd28affe43;Xdc4ca1d47;Xe4e421cbf;Xe75c0441e;Xf9a37d050;Xfa008cf93;Xfb0c9f3cc;Xfd89c91e8,21,Interpretations of the Web of Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3378,2009

239,"E-business, information serving, and ubiquitous computing will create heavy request traffic from strangers or even incognitos. Such requests must be managed automatically. Two ways of doing this are well known: giving every incognito consumer the same treatment, and rendering service in return for money. However, different behavior will be often wanted, e.g., for a university library with different access policies for undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, alumni, citizens of the same state, and everyone else. For a data or process server contacted by client machines on behalf of users not previously known, we show how to provide reliable automatic access administration conforming to service agreements. Implementations scale well from very small collections of consumers and producers to immense client/server networks. Servers can deliver information, effect state changes, and control external equipment. Consumer privacy is easily addressed by the same protocol. We support consumer privacy, but allow servers to deny their resources to incognitos. A protocol variant even protects against statistical attacks by consortia of service organizations. One e-commerce application would put the consumer's tokens on a smart card whose readers are in vending kiosks. In e-business we can simplify supply chain administration. Our method can also be used in sensitive networks without introducing new security loopholes.","Gladney, H.

241,"This article aims at reengineering of PDF-based complex documents, where specifications of the Object Management Group (OMG) are our initial targets. Our motivation is that such specifications are dense and intricate to use, and tend to have complicated structures. Our objective is therefore to create an approach that allows us to reengineer PDF-based documents, and to illustrate how to make more usable versions of electronic documents (such as specifications, technical books, etc) so that end users to have a better experience with them. The first step was to extract the logical structure of the document in a meaningful XML format for subsequent processing. Our initial assumption was that, many key concepts of a document are expressed in this structure. In the next phase, we created a multilayer hypertext version of the document to facilitate browsing and navigating. Although we initially focused on OMG software specifications, we chose a general approach for different phases of our work including format conversions, logical structure extraction, text extraction, multilayer hypertext generation, and concept exploration. As a consequence, we can process other complex documents to achieve our goals.","Nojoumian, Mehrdad;Lethbridge, Timothy C.",ArXiv e-prints,X3232c2ed2;X5a04023e5;X5fb15bc16;X6396b6711;X72ed6d169;X8e8bb2c6d;X984b4c8c6;X992afc1e9;Xa8a956d7d;Xadac77ac0;Xbe6cb69cc;Xc25e17f3a;Xca20dbb99;Xd0d68413a;Xd37090c03;Xdc5929e53;Xef3ebc51f,17,Reengineering PDF-Based Documents Targeting Complex Software Specifications,http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.4717,2009

248,"In the process of scientific research, many information objects are generated, all of which may remain valuable indefinitely. However, artifacts such as instrument data and associated calibration information may have little value in isolation; their meaning is derived from their relationships to each other. Individual artifacts are best represented as components of a life cycle that is specific to a scientific research domain or project. Current cataloging practices do not describe objects at a sufficient level of granularity nor do they offer the globally persistent identifiers necessary to discover and manage scholarly products with World Wide Web standards. The Open Archives Initiative's Object Reuse and Exchange data model (OAI-ORE) meets these requirements. We demonstrate a conceptual implementation of OAI-ORE to represent the scientific life cycles of embedded networked sensor applications in seismology and environmental sciences. By establishing relationships between publications, data, and contextual research information, we illustrate how to obtain a richer and more realistic view of scientific practices. That view can facilitate new forms of scientific research and learning.

252,"Even the best information retrieval model cannot always identify the most useful answers to a user query. This is in particular the case with web search systems, where it is known that users tend to minimise their effort to access relevant information. It is, however, believed that the interaction between users and a retrieval system, such as a web search engine, can be exploited to provide better answers to users. Interactive Information Retrieval (IR) systems, in which users access information through a series of interactions with the search system, are concerned with building models for IR, where interaction plays a central role. There are many possible interactions between a user and a search system, ranging from query (re)formulation to relevance feedback. However, capturing them within a single framework is difficult and previously proposed approaches have mostly focused on relevance feedback. In this paper, we propose a general framework for interactive IR that is able to capture the full interaction process in a principled way. Our approach relies upon a generalisation of the probability framework of quantum physics, whose strong geometric component can be a key towards a successful interactive IR model.","Piwowarski, B.;Lalmas, M.",ArXiv e-prints,X0ff972cd3;X101e4bbfa;X16f159fea;X2abb24e41;X32ddc0a6b;X564ba7b33;X651cb4371;Xc13b10a62;Xc25e17f3a;Xc78b95f3b;Xd9de0dc46;Xec5e4f59b,12,A Quantum-based Model for Interactive Information Retrieval (extended version),http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4026,2009
253,"As defined by the Memento Framework, TimeMaps are ma-chine-readable lists of time-specific copies -- called ""mementos"" -- of an archived original resource. In theory, as an archive acquires additional mementos over time, a TimeMap should be monotonically increasing. However, there are reasons why the number of mementos in a TimeMap would decrease, for example: archival redaction of some or all of the mementos, archival restructuring, and transient errors on the part of one or more archives. We study TimeMaps for 4,000 original resources over a three month period, note their change patterns, and develop a caching algorithm for TimeMaps suitable for a reverse proxy in front of a Memento aggregator. We show that TimeMap cardinality is constant or monotonically increasing for 80.2% of all TimeMap downloads observed in the observation period. The goal of the caching algorithm is to exploit the ideally monotonically increasing nature of TimeMaps and not cache responses with fewer mementos than the already cached TimeMap. This new caching algorithm uses conditional cache replacement and a Time To Live (TTL) value to ensure the user has access to the most complete TimeMap available. Based on our empirical data, a TTL of 15 days will minimize the number of mementos missed by users, and minimize the load on archives contributing to TimeMaps.","Brunelle, Justin F.;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,551463258b;X00dbbb0da;X371a6f61a;X6fc6944d8;X72e2f2c0b;Xabdb3db5b;Xe039073a5;Xe8bca3d22;Xfa114a658;Xfe1dbc03b,10,An Evaluation of Caching Policies for Memento TimeMaps,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5685,2013
254,"Contemporary scholarly discourse follows many alternative routes in addition to the three-century old tradition of publication in peer-reviewed journals. The field of High- Energy Physics (HEP) has explored alternative communication strategies for decades, initially via the mass mailing of paper copies of preliminary manuscripts, then via the inception of the first online repositories and digital libraries. This field is uniquely placed to answer recurrent questions raised by the current trends in scholarly communication: is there an advantage for scientists to make their work available through repositories, often in preliminary form? Is there an advantage to publishing in Open Access journals? Do scientists still read journals or do they use digital repositories? The analysis of citation data demonstrates that free and immediate online dissemination of preprints creates an immense citation advantage in HEP, whereas publication in Open Access journals presents no discernible advantage. In addition, the analysis of clickstreams in the leading digital library of the field shows that HEP scientists seldom read journals, preferring preprints instead.","Gentil-Beccot, Anne;Mele, Salvatore;Brooks, Travis",ArXiv e-prints,X0093af2dd;X0125dcf10;X01c2bf2b3;X07c20c0b2;X08e974e80;X0a370529c;X0a5113c7f;X0aa4810c6;X0d5d26bbd;X0d6dec402;X0dd9f7107;X0dda070c0;X120139485;X18bff2d9d;X28b4baf59;X2a7efa9c1;X2baf55aeb;X2ef8a4546;X30bfb094d;X3152e7afc;X324aae21a;X348814447;X349bc2009;X34b0c2526;X3616ca0b2;X370afe1df;X37206498f;X3cf593b89;X40f925368;X4a5c1fd62;X4bf518cee;X4c1b6d5d2;X51673f8b6;X527d043c7;X56be3da42;X584c50b14;X5a72e6a96;X5d2f1264f;X5f6598883;X610df39d7;X61e4c97d1;X6974142b8;X6c7b09298;X700cd4198;X72ee5eb9c;X74c43a30b;X77ace72b2;X79239b5ed;X7a6ccdaa0;X7b78eb0e7;X7bbda9971;X7c42e8ee0;X7d07730b9;X7e8447199;X7ee09ee81;X8190b102c;X81e6cb303;X8249adb30;X854b3e855;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X8cd17292f;X8cee44d46;X9156758d1;X937a3501e;X9464d3adf;X9cb01d7b9;X9d12c6905;X9d9490b8b;X9e06374fe;Xa1fa9fa78;Xa3acb144b;Xa418d1dc6;Xa9b3bbacd;Xac2400afc;Xadd66b30a;Xafe1ea12b;Xb1875d7bd;Xb81c9b55b;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbc137767e;Xbdf11e1bf;Xc0368398d;Xc25e17f3a;Xc460ae4c6;Xc55e07c3a;Xca6cba434;Xcbbfe7823;Xcd22ecad6;Xcdd8d19d8;Xce8d9517e;Xd011d9c1b;Xd3ada6f04;Xd54acce0b;Xd801b38de;Xd8c5bf858;Xd9ed1b740;Xda7b026af;Xdd11f7673;Xdd2908ea5;Xdf8aa1f6e;Xe36e5e5fb;Xe5283b6b2;Xe54d2bc7b;Xe83f10108;Xecf111a01;Xefdbe3380;Xf03a00bbd;Xf1b0abc16;Xf3b223276;Xf6b802223;Xf957f541d;Xfa77c9a50;Xfb297b8fd;Xfed0ddf49,116,Citing and Reading Behaviours in High-Energy Physics.

This search engine is specifically targeted to clinicians and healthcare practitioners searching for documents related to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). To this aim, the presented tool exploits two pathology-specific ontologies that allow focused document indexing and retrieval. These ontologies have been developed on the top of the Middle Layer Ontology for Clinical Care (MLOCC), which provides a link with the Basic Formal Ontology, a foundational ontology used in the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry.

256,"Scientific collaboration is often perceived as a joint global process that involves researchers worldwide, regardless of their place of work and residence. Globalization of science, in this respect, implies that collaboration among scientists takes place along the lines of common topics and irrespective of the spatial distances between the collaborators. The networks of collaborators, termed 'epistemic communities', should thus have a space-independent structure. This paper shows that such a notion of globalized scientific collaboration is not supported by empirical data. It introduces a novel approach of analyzing distance-dependent probabilities of collaboration. The results of the analysis of six distinct scientific fields reveal that intra-country collaboration is about 10-50 times more likely to occur than international collaboration. Moreover, strong dependencies exist between collaboration activity (measured in co-authorships) and spatial distance when confined to national borders. However, the fact that distance becomes irrelevant once collaboration is taken to the international scale suggests a globalized science system that is strongly influenced by the gravity of local science clusters. The similarity of the probability functions of the six science fields analyzed suggests a universal mode of spatial governance that is independent from the mode of knowledge creation in science.","Hennemann, Stefan;Rybski, Diego;Liefner, Ingo",ArXiv e-prints,X00eeb32a4;X0abdb4df2;X0ad9dfbcf;X2cfe57f4d;X32664eb28;X432100780;X6bf522ee2;X89e5874a0;Xb56a56194;Xbf349ac47;Xc6eb38a01;Xceb0d1643;Xe6e2bb476,13,The Myth of Global Science Collaboration - Collaboration patterns in epistemic communities,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2980,2011

Here, we take advantage of the entire Physical Review publication archive (1893-2006) to construct authors’ networks where weighted edges, as measured from opportunely normalized citation counts, define a proxy for the mechanism of scientific credit transfer. On this network, we define a ranking method based on a diffusion algorithm that mimics the spreading of scientific credits on the network. We compare the results obtained with our algorithm with those obtained by local measures such as the citation count and provide a statistical analysis of the assignment of major career awards in the area of physics.

258,"The study of the citation histories and ageing of documents are topics that have been addressed from several perspectives, especially in the analysis of documents with delayed recognition or sleeping beauties. However, there is no general methodology that can be extensively applied for different time periods and/or research fields. In this paper a new methodology for the general analysis of the ageing and durability of scientific papers is presented. This methodology classifies documents into three general types: Delayed documents, which receive the main part of their citations later than normal documents; Flash in the pans, which receive citations immediately after their publication but they are not cited in the long term; and Normal documents, documents with a typical distribution of citations over time. These three types of durability have been analyzed considering the whole population of documents in the Web of Science with at least 5 external citations (i.e. not considering self-citations). Several patterns related to the three types of durability have been found and the potential for further research of the developed methodology is discussed.","Costas, Rodrigo;van Leeuwen, Thed N.;van Raan, Anthony F.

We use the output of all methods to query Internet search engines and analyze their retrieval performance. Our results show that both LSs and titles perform fairly well with over 60% URIs returned top ranked from Yahoo!. However, the combination of methods improves the retrieval performance. Considering the complexity of the LS generation, querying the title first and in case of insufficient results querying the LSs second is the preferable setup.

261,"The research area of nuclear astrophysics is characterized by a need for information published in tens of journals in several fields and an extremely dilute distribution of researchers. For these reasons it is difficult for researchers, especially students, to be adequately informed of the relevant published research. For example, the commonly employed journal club is inefficient for a group consisting of a professor and his two students. In an attempt to address this problem, we have developed a virtual journal (VJ), a process for collecting and distributing a weekly compendium of articles of interest to researchers in nuclear astrophysics. Subscribers are notified of each VJ issue using an email-list server or an RSS feed. The VJ data base is searchable by topics assigned by the editors, or by keywords. There are two related VJs: the Virtual Journal of Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA VJ), and the SEGUE Virtual Journal (SEGUE VJ). The JINA VJ also serves as a source of new experimental and theoretical information for the JINA REACLIB reaction rate database. References to review articles and popular level articles provide an introduction to the literature for students.

In fields like HEP and astrophysics, the journal affordability/accessibility problem is not as great as in many other fields, where it the HEP Early Access impact advantage translates into the OA impact advantage itself.

Since LSs are expensive to generate, we investigate the potential of web pages' titles as they are available at a lower cost. We present the results from studying the change of titles over time. We take titles from copies provided by the Internet Archive of randomly sampled web pages and show the frequency of change as well as the degree of change in terms of the Levenshtein score. We found very low frequencies of change and high Levenshtein scores indicating that titles, on average, change little from their original, first observed values (rooted comparison) and even less from the values of their previous observation (sliding).","Klein, Martin;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X25a507a59;X3954f5892;X70ebaa43f;X813f4d8f7;Xa37748b0d;Xbc915ef9d;Xc25e17f3a,7,Investigating the Change of Web Pages' Titles Over Time,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3445,2009

Unfortunately, we still lack a systematic understanding of the behavior of the systems and their relationship with documents. In this paper we present a completely new approach towards the understanding of the information retrieval systems. Recently, it has been observed that retrieval systems in TREC 6 show some remarkable patterns in retrieving relevant documents. Based on the TREC 6 observations, we introduce a geometric linear model of information retrieval systems. We then apply the model to predict the number of relevant documents by the retrieval systems. The model is also scalable to a much larger data set. Although the model is developed based on the TREC 6 routing test data, I believe it can be readily applicable to other information retrieval systems. In Appendix, we explained a simple and efficient way of making a better system from the existing systems.","Kim, Myung Ho",ArXiv e-prints,X6607600bd;X9613839c4;Xaddc824f1;Xcbf99df89;Xeff1eed0e;Xf20e17ca8,6,A Geometric Model for Information Retrieval Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9912002,1999
266,"arXiv.org mediates contact with the literature for entire scholarly communities, both through provision of archival access and through daily email and web announcements of new materials, potentially many screenlengths long. We confirm and extend a surprising correlation between article position in these initial announcements, ordered by submission time, and later citation impact, due primarily to intentional ""self-promotion"" on the part of authors. A pure ""visibility"" effect was also present: the subset of articles accidentally in early positions fared measurably better in the long-term citation record than those lower down. Astrophysics articles announced in position 1, for example, overall received a median number of citations 83\% higher, while those there accidentally had a 44\% visibility boost. For two large subcommunities of theoretical high energy physics, hep-th and hep-ph articles announced in position 1 had median numbers of citations 50\% and 100\% larger than for positions 5--15, and the subsets there accidentally had visibility boosts of 38\% and 71\%. We also consider the positional effects on early readership. The median numbers of early full text downloads for astro-ph, hep-th, and hep-ph articles announced in position 1 were 82\%, 61\%, and 58\% higher than for lower positions, respectively, and those there accidentally had medians visibility-boosted by 53\%, 44\%, and 46\%. Finally, we correlate a variety of readership features with long-term citations, using machine learning methods, thereby extending previous results on the predictive power of early readership in a broader context. We conclude with some observations on impact metrics and dangers of recommender mechanisms.","Haque, Asif-ul;Ginsparg, Paul",ArXiv e-prints,5458efd927;54e1d3e094;54f8c93d85;54fd9dfb70;X056da635b;X06edb8fd5;X07c20c0b2;X0ca1a03b4;X0cb5d9afe;X0ef2d004f;X120139485;X153d92d46;X192109981;X1c4f890b3;X1c92a541f;X1d54a57b9;X25d9b662b;X27ddf4e66;X299d26e3a;X2abb24e41;X31a8d53f4;X320ba40ae;X348814447;X3578a304a;X37206498f;X3da6d53b9;X3dbc8d3ff;X3eaede846;X3f568c399;X45dcbe866;X4b0703a92;X4b2b7d996;X4bf6030bb;X4c1b6d5d2;X4d71e4e90;X4e0d803d9;X51cbcdc78;X527d043c7;X54dbf7d51;X5d2f1264f;X6257c8748;X6974142b8;X70989da6e;X74c43a30b;X7c0af840a;X7c8d3e76f;X7ee444e4b;X80a221249;X81d0e66a6;X8249adb30;X8494f5559;X84fc3a076;X86c487c6e;X8972ba11a;X898d74472;X8b86b7577;X8cbaca389;X8e8bb2c6d;X8f7d1f19f;X9222c033a;X9902b0a55;X992d74f47;X99f23f3e7;X9a568f7d8;X9bd951d10;X9dce653f2;Xa78f7a072;Xafe1ea12b;Xb1875d7bd;Xb1d82db1c;Xb8affceb2;Xb8ca47407;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbb946d1c7;Xc1e1f64de;Xc25e17f3a;Xc6be86874;Xc9b7a5196;Xcad4683be;Xccd0059c7;Xcd52bc681;Xd011d9c1b;Xd756260e9;Xda10c3f29;Xda7b026af;Xdfc50841a;Xdfd109653;Xe5283b6b2;Xebdce7c04;Xee16090f1;Xf3b223276;Xfdea7d14b;Xfeeeb7451;Xff8f55b48,95,Positional Effects on Citation and Readership in arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4740,2009

In providing data for public use, there has been a stimulated interest in a movement dubbed Open Data. Open Data is analogous in many ways to the Open Source movement. However, instead of focusing on software, Open Data is focused on the legal and licensing issues around publicly exposed data. Together, various technological and legal tools are laying the groundwork for the future of global-scale data management on the Web. As of today, in its early form, the Web of Data hosts a variety of data sets that include encyclopedic facts, drug and protein data, metadata on music, books and scholarly articles, social network representations, geospatial information, and many other types of information.

270,"We find evidence for the universality of two relative bibliometric indicators of the quality of individual scientific publications taken from different data sets. One of these is a new index that considers both citation and reference counts. We demonstrate this universality for relatively well cited publications from a single institute, grouped by year of publication and by faculty or by department. We show similar behaviour in publications submitted to the arXiv e-print archive, grouped by year of submission and by sub-archive. We also find that for reasonably well cited papers this distribution is well fitted by a lognormal with a variance of around 1.3 which is consistent with the results of Radicchi, Fortunato, and Castellano (2008). Our work demonstrates that comparisons can be made between publications from different disciplines and publication dates, regardless of their citation count and without expensive access to the whole world-wide citation graph. Further, it shows that averages of the logarithm of such relative bibliometric indices deal with the issue of long tails and avoid the need for statistics based on lengthy ranking procedures.","Evans, T.

The parameters capture the two main ingredients of the model: the aging of the relevance of papers and the formation of triangles when new papers cite old. We compare our model to three network structural quantities of an empirical citation network. We find that unique point in parameter space optimizing the match between the real and model data for all quantities. The optimal parameter values suggest that the impact of scientific papers, at least in the empirical data set we model, is proportional to the inverse of the number of papers since they were published.","Wu, Zhi-Xi;Holme, Petter",Physical Review E,X1226fe79a;X29bfd89bb;X345e186e5;X45607f30b;X7ffa92d61;Xb7672e303;Xc25e17f3a,7,Modeling scientific-citation patterns and other triangle-rich acyclic networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2615,2009
272,"This paper analyzes the effect of interdisciplinarity on the scientific impact of individual papers. Using all the papers published in Web of Science in 2000, we define the degree of interdisciplinarity of a given paper as the percentage of its cited references made to journals of other disciplines. We show that, although for all disciplines combined there is no clear correlation between the level of interdisciplinarity of papers and their citation rates, there are nonetheless some disciplines in which a higher level of interdisciplinarity is related to a higher citation rates. For other disciplines, citations decline as interdisciplinarity grows. One characteristic is visible in all disciplines: highly disciplinary and highly interdisciplinary papers have a low scientific impact. This suggests that there might be an optimum of interdisciplinarity beyond which the research is too dispersed to find its niche and under which it is too mainstream to have high impact. Finally, the relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientific impact is highly determined by the citation characteristics of the disciplines involved: papers citing citation intensive disciplines are more likely to be cited by those disciplines and, hence, obtain higher citation scores than papers citing non citation intensive disciplines.","Lariviere, Vincent;Gingras, Yves",ArXiv e-prints,X0164b85ad;X02f309050;X0f4ad1bc0;X1710495b2;X1c5f3195d;X23da3f73c;X276f8cdc6;X39470e0f7;X496b3ea49;X50b0d9934;X521cca404;X5d63cb905;X663189fd3;X7a62fa141;X97fc8c155;X9b2a162ea;Xa1b994b71;Xa6d284475;Xa6f5be79a;Xb2338d388;Xb4d09b6b5;Xb65ee3e52;Xc1993bb4f;Xc25e17f3a;Xc4857f2eb,25,On the relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientific impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1776,2009
273,"Since the publication of Robert K. Merton's theory of cumulative advantage in science (Matthew Effect), several empirical studies have tried to measure its presence at the level of papers, individual researchers, institutions or countries. However, these studies seldom control for the intrinsic ""quality"" of papers or of researchers--""better"" (however defined) papers or researchers could receive higher citation rates because they are indeed of better quality. Using an original method for controlling the intrinsic value of papers--identical duplicate papers published in different journals with different impact factors--this paper shows that the journal in which papers are published have a strong influence on their citation rates, as duplicate papers published in high impact journals obtain, on average, twice as much citations as their identical counterparts published in journals with lower impact factors. The intrinsic value of a paper is thus not the only reason a given paper gets cited or not; there is a specific Matthew effect attached to journals and this gives to paper published there an added value over and above their intrinsic quality.","Lariviere, Vincent;Gingras, Yves",ArXiv e-prints,5547e2cd23;X024227acb;X074538a12;X07c20c0b2;X0b559beb5;X105ef3c70;X11a961598;X192109981;X1d54a57b9;X22b38c732;X22f63931a;X25b25aefe;X28183a2ed;X2ed1220df;X2ef8a4546;X348814447;X37206498f;X3da6d53b9;X3fb0c88a7;X4279fefec;X4c1b6d5d2;X509a35326;X527d043c7;X5429d8c73;X549e72599;X5d2f1264f;X610ec9b63;X687d1ef65;X6900b4d79;X6974142b8;X69e140b5b;X6bd4c723b;X71d2f75a1;X72e42389f;X730c7ffb9;X73bee139c;X748888e2b;X74c43a30b;X74cb266b9;X7616a12fa;X764a0fc02;X7668464ed;X77fa54239;X79fface2c;X7d2985c68;X7ebc8f500;X7fea53e4e;X8249adb30;X862a31899;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X8cb601786;X986522bd8;X98e40fefe;Xa1b994b71;Xa1e6aa217;Xa1f1f00cf;Xa26004b4a;Xa3cbb3a01;Xa5695892c;Xa76b60116;Xabbc56e77;Xad3f459db;Xaf26faaa4;Xaf353ea0c;Xafc83bd12;Xb1875d7bd;Xb198fa13a;Xb1f4b8130;Xb82c00ec3;Xb885fdac5;Xb96d67edb;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbed67bf59;Xc0975f32d;Xc25e17f3a;Xc26a0d11f;Xc6c5f843a;Xc78c2896c;Xc8d542b7b;Xc9f411ffc;Xcc82bc0e7;Xcd95ea946;Xd011d9c1b;Xd2fa3ef7f;Xd623a8d6b;Xd636c3608;Xd77ad5a44;Xd9fa8ccc7;Xe10cee95b;Xe32f68140;Xe4f8c1f4e;Xe5283b6b2;Xe59365158;Xe880dd390;Xea0c1a83b;Xef8bcf0b1;Xf3b223276;Xfbdee5f1e,100,The impact factor's Matthew effect: a natural experiment in bibliometrics,http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3177,2009
274,"Data volumes from multiple sky surveys have grown from gigabytes into terabytes during the past decade, and will grow from terabytes into tens (or hundreds) of petabytes in the next decade. This exponential growth of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research, requiring new approaches. Thus far, astronomy has tended to address these challenges in an informal and ad hoc manner, with the necessary special expertise being assigned to e-Science or survey science. However, we see an even wider scope and therefore promote a broader vision of this data-driven revolution in astronomical research. For astronomy to effectively cope with and reap the maximum scientific return from existing and future large sky surveys, facilities, and data-producing projects, we need our own information science specialists. We therefore recommend the formal creation, recognition, and support of a major new discipline, which we call Astroinformatics. Astroinformatics includes a set of naturally-related specialties including data organization, data description, astronomical classification taxonomies, astronomical concept ontologies, data mining, machine learning, visualization, and astrostatistics. By virtue of its new stature, we propose that astronomy now needs to integrate Astroinformatics as a formal sub-discipline within agency funding plans, university departments, research programs, graduate training, and undergraduate education. Now is the time for the recognition of Astroinformatics as an essential methodology of astronomical research. The future of astronomy depends on it.","Borne, Kirk;Accomazzi, Alberto;Bloom, Joshua;Brunner, Robert;Burke, Douglas;Butler, Nathaniel;Chernoff, David F.;Connolly, Brian;Connolly, Andrew;Connors, Alanna;Cutler, Curt;Desai, Shantanu;Djorgovski, George;Feigelson, Eric;Finn, L.

275,"As our capacity to study ever-expanding domains of our science has increased (including the time domain, non-electromagnetic phenomena, magnetized plasmas, and numerous sky surveys in multiple wavebands with broad spatial coverage and unprecedented depths), so have the horizons of our understanding of the Universe been similarly expanding. This expansion is coupled to the exponential data deluge from multiple sky surveys, which have grown from gigabytes into terabytes during the past decade, and will grow from terabytes into Petabytes (even hundreds of Petabytes) in the next decade. With this increased vastness of information, there is a growing gap between our awareness of that information and our understanding of it. Training the next generation in the fine art of deriving intelligent understanding from data is needed for the success of sciences, communities, projects, agencies, businesses, and economies. This is true for both specialists (scientists) and non-specialists (everyone else: the public, educators and students, workforce). Specialists must learn and apply new data science research techniques in order to advance our understanding of the Universe. Non-specialists require information literacy skills as productive members of the 21st century workforce, integrating foundational skills for lifelong learning in a world increasingly dominated by data. We address the impact of the emerging discipline of data science on astronomy education within two contexts: formal education and lifelong learners.","Borne, Kirk D.;Jacoby, Suzanne;Carney, Karen;Connolly, Andy;Eastman, Timothy;Raddick, M.

277,"The NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), along with astronomy's journals and data centers (a collaboration dubbed URANIA), has developed a distributed on-line digital library which has become the dominant means by which astronomers search, access and read their technical literature.Digital libraries such as the NASA Astrophysics Data System \citep{2005JASIS.tmp....2K} permit the easy accumulation of a new type of bibliometric measure, the number of electronic accesses (``reads'') of individual articles. We explore various aspects of this new measure.We examine the obsolescence function as measured by actual reads, and show that it can be well fit by the sum of four exponentials with very different time constants. We compare the obsolescence function as measured by readership with the obsolescence function as measured by citations. We find that the citation function is proportional to the sum of two of the components of the readership function. This proves that the normative theory of citation is true in the mean. We further examine in detail the similarities and differences between the citation rate, the readership rate and the total citations for individual articles, and discuss some of the causes.Using the number of reads as a bibliometric measure for individuals, we introduce the read-cite diagram to provide a two-dimensional view of an individual's scientific productivity. We develop a simple model to account for an individual's reads and cites and use it to show that the position of a person in the read-cite diagram is a function of age, innate productivity, and work history. We show the age biases of both reads and cites, and develop two new bibliometric measures which have substantially less age bias than citations: SumProd, a weighted sum of total citations and the readership rate, intended to show the total productivity of an individual; and Read10, the readership rate for papers published in the last ten years, intended to show an individual's current productivity. We also discuss the effect of normalization (dividing by the number of authors on a paper) on these statistics.We apply SumProd and Read10 using new, non-parametric techniques to rank and compare different astronomical research organizations","Kurtz, Michael J.;Eichhorn, Guenther;Accomazzi, Alberto;Grant, Carolyn S.;Demleitner, Markus;Murray, Stephen S.;Martimbeau, Nathalie;Elwell, Barbara",Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,413dc5cd37;460b999f39;488018b97c;4dcbcf125f;530b88c7e0;533d72ef23;536630c3fe;53735a377d;54e41740a3;54ebc899a4;550df99c06;551817bb20;X0245231be;X0ad35f7c7;X0b8b14003;X1064cbf87;X13c094d1c;X1932e6786;X3e580dcd7;X47d9ccbed;X5093c718e;Xb0b6151d7;Xc06ef2103;Xc25e17f3a;Xe017a8aba,25,The Bibliometric Properties of Article Readership Information,http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4789,2005
278,"The launching of Scopus and Google Scholar, and methodological developments in Social Network Analysis have made many more indicators for evaluating journals available than the traditional Impact Factor, Cited Half-life, and Immediacy Index of the ISI. In this study, these new indicators are compared with one another and with the older ones. Do the various indicators measure new dimensions of the citation networks, or are they highly correlated among them? Are they robust and relatively stable over time? Two main dimensions are distinguished -- size and impact -- which together shape influence. The H-index combines the two dimensions and can also be considered as an indicator of reach (like Indegree). PageRank is mainly an indicator of size, but has important interactions with centrality measures. The Scimago Journal Ranking (SJR) indicator provides an alternative to the Journal Impact Factor, but the computation is less easy.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X0b8b14003;X29bfd89bb;X7dfdbec91;X9b686a54e;X9fba3a296;Xbeb5545c1;Xc25e17f3a;Xdb9e3a6a7,8,How are new citation-based journal indicators adding to the bibliometric toolbox?,http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4457,2009
279,"We present a simple generalization of Hirsch's h-index, Z = \sqrt{h^{2}+C}/\sqrt{5}, where C is the total number of citations. Z is aimed at correcting the potentially excessive penalty made by h on a scientist's highly cited papers, because for the majority of scientists analyzed, we find the excess citation fraction (C-h^{2})/C to be distributed closely around the value 0.75, meaning that 75 percent of the author's impact is neglected. Additionally, Z is less sensitive to local changes in a scientist's citation profile, namely perturbations which increase h while only marginally affecting C. Using real career data for 476 physicists careers and 488 biologist careers, we analyze both the distribution of $Z$ and the rank stability of Z with respect to the Hirsch index h and the Egghe index g. We analyze careers distributed across a wide range of total impact, including top-cited physicists and biologists for benchmark comparison. In practice, the Z-index requires the same information needed to calculate h and could be effortlessly incorporated within career profile databases, such as Google Scholar and ResearcherID. Because Z incorporates information from the entire publication profile while being more robust than h and g to local perturbations, we argue that Z is better suited for ranking comparisons in academic decision-making scenarios comprising a large number of scientists.","Petersen, Alexander M.;Succi, Sauro",ArXiv e-prints,X201f7b3d9;X34c00b646;X6adf76841;X80d78009c;X86a12cee2;X8b8d80a6b;X9909c5134;Xdf5b6863d,8,The Z-index: A geometric representation of productivity and impact which accounts for information in the entire rank-citation profile,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5752,2013

282,"The task of similarity search in multimedia databases is usually accomplished by range or k nearest neighbor queries. However, the expressing power of these ""single-example"" queries fails when the user's delicate query intent is not available as a single example. Recently, the well-known skyline operator was reused in metric similarity search as a ""multi-example"" query type. When applied on a multi-dimensional database (i.e., on a multi-attribute table), the traditional skyline operator selects all database objects that are not dominated by other objects. The metric skyline query adopts the skyline operator such that the multiple attributes are represented by distances (similarities) to multiple query examples. Hence, we can view the metric skyline as a set of representative database objects which are as similar to all the examples as possible and, simultaneously, are semantically distinct. In this paper we propose a technique of processing the metric skyline query by use of PM-tree, while we show that our technique significantly outperforms the original M-tree based implementation in both time and space costs. In experiments we also evaluate the partial metric skyline processing, where only a controlled number of skyline objects is retrieved.","Skopal, Tomas;Lokoc, Jakub",ArXiv e-prints,,0,On Metric Skyline Processing by PM-tree,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0983,2009
283,"Designing and implementing comprehensive IT-based support environments for KM in organizations is fraught with many problems. Solving them requires intimate knowledge about the information usage in knowledge works and the scopes of technology intervention. In this paper, the Task-oriented Organizational Knowledge Management or TOKM, a design theory for building integrated IT platforms for supporting organizational KM, is proposed. TOKM brings together two apparently mutually exclusive practices of building KM systems, the task-based approach and the generic or universalistic approach. In developing the design, the information requirements of knowledge workers in light of an information usage model of knowledge works is studied. Then the model is extended to study possibilities of more advanced IT support and formulate them in form of a set of meta-requirements. Following the IS design theory paradigm, a set of artifacts are hypothesized to meet the requirements. Finally, a design method, as a possible approach of building an IT-based integrated platform, the Knowledge Work Support Platform (KWSP) to realize the artifacts in order to meet the requirements, is outlined. The KWSP is a powerful platform for building and maintaining a number of task-type specific Knowledge Work Support Systems (KWSS) on a common sharable platform. Each KWSS, for the task-type supported by it, can be easily designed to provide extensive and sophisticated support to individual as well as group of knowledge workers in performing their respective knowledge work instances","Laha, Arijit",ArXiv e-prints,X32e991ed5;X63e50ce4b;X738b3d94e;X83e055dae;X9af27c257;Xc25e17f3a;Xc7de63bd0;Xd4d30f84c;Xe060d02f9;Xe3ada313b,10,On challenges and opportunities of designing integrated IT platforms for supporting knowledge works in organizations,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2626,2009

285,"One of the most important goals of information management (IM) is supporting the knowledge workers in performing their works. In this paper we examine issues of relevance, linkage and provenance of information, as accessed and used by the knowledge workers. These are usually not adequately addressed in most of the IT based solutions for IM. Here we propose a non-conventional approach for building information systems for supporting the knowledge workers which addresses these issues. The approach leads to the ideas of building Information Warehouses (IW) and Knowledge work Support Systems (KwSS). Such systems can open up potential for building innovative applications of significant impact, including those capable of helping organizations in implementing processes for double-loop learning.","Laha, Arijit",ArXiv e-prints,Xc25e17f3a;Xd8011adb2;Xf79048aaa,3,On building Information Warehouses,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2638,2009
286,"Preserving access to file content requires preserving not just bits but also meaningful logical structures. The ongoing development of the Data Format Description Language (DFDL) is a completely general standard that addresses this need. The Defuddle parser is a generic parser that can use DFDL-style format descriptions to extract logical structures from ASCII or binary files written in those formats. DFDL and Defuddle provide a preservation capability that has minimal format-specific software and cleanly separates issues related to bits, formats, and logical content. Such a system has the potential to greatly reduce overall system development and maintenance costs as well as the per-file-format costs for long term preservation.","McGrath, Robert E.;Kastner, Jason;Rodriguez, Alejandro;Myers, Jim",ArXiv e-prints,X0c8b5dd21;X69ff8d135;Xc25e17f3a;Xf79048aaa,4,Towards a Semantic Preservation System,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3152,2009

Here we propose an adaptive model which combines similarities in users' rating patterns with epidemic-like spreading of news on an evolving network. We study the model by computer agent-based simulations, measure its performance and discuss its robustness against bias and malicious behavior. Subject to the approval fraction of news recommended, the proposed model outperforms the widely adopted recommendation of news according to their absolute or relative popularity. This model provides a general social mechanism for recommender systems and may find its applications also in other types of recommendation.","Medo, Matúš;Zhang, Yi-Cheng;Zhou, Tao",EPL (Europhysics Letters),X3a0e2dfed;X3d281bde8;X40ef5c961;X4b1fbdfd1;X51819bedf;X5a3cc87b5;X5eb844c76;X7628cc021;X79037505a;Xa3a54b870;Xa4513a611;Xa47c0f17a;Xa5d266d0d;Xae4862e93;Xc25e17f3a;Xc69ce953f;Xd1cd0d03a;Xdb16630dc;Xe7407e444;Xf3a06fd44;Xf4f7070c3;Xf7601d754;Xfcff454b3,23,Adaptive model for recommendation of news,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3490,2009

289,"In a university, research assessments are organized at different policy levels (faculties, research council) in different contexts (funding, council membership, personnel evaluations). Each evaluation requires its own focus and methodology. To conduct a coherent research policy however, data on which different assessments are based should be well coordinated. A common set of core indicators for any type of research assessment can provide a supportive and objectivating tool for evaluations at different institutional levels and at the same time promote coherent decision-making. The same indicators can also form the basis for a 'light touch' monitoring instrument, signalling when and where a more thorough evaluation could be considered. This poster paper shows how peer review results were used to validate a set of quantitative indicators for research quality for a first series of disciplines. The indicators correspond to categories in the university's standard CV-format. Per discipline, specific indicators are identified corresponding to their own publication and funding characteristics. Also more globally valid indicators are identified after normalization for discipline-characteristic performance levels. The method can be applied to any system where peer ratings and quantitative performance measures, both reliable and sufficiently detailed, can be combined for the same entities.","Rons, Nadine",ArXiv e-prints,X13ad040e7;X2e7a5c5f1;X2f615d818;X6315af3db;X660f0342f;X7bebc7294;X807174c4e;Xc69422f40;Xd5018f451,9,"Quantitative CV-based indicators for research quality, validated by peer review",http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6760,2013
290,"In this paper, we present the SharedCanvas model for describing the layout of culturally important, hand-written objects such as medieval manuscripts, which is intended to be used as a common input format to presentation interfaces. The model is evaluated using two collections from CATCHPlus not consulted during the design phase, each with their own complex requirements, in order to determine if further development is required or if the model is ready for general usage. The model is applied to the new collections, revealing several new areas of concern for user interface production and discovery of the constituent resources. However, the fundamental information modelling aspects of SharedCanvas and the underlying Open Annotation Collaboration ontology are demonstrated to be sufficient to cover the challenging new requirements. The distributed, Linked Open Data approach is validated as an important methodology to seamlessly allow simultaneous interaction with multiple repositories, and at the same time to facilitate both scholarly commentary and crowd-sourcing of the production of transcriptions.","Sanderson, Robert;Brugman, Hennie;Albritton, Benjamin;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X1a95e08d4;X38575e34c;X8051308c3;Xc1b45f555;Xc5127c3dd;Xe8e4a540b,6,Evaluating the SharedCanvas Manuscript Data Model in CATCHPlus,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3687,2011

The idea that research assessment must be done using ``simple and objective'' methods is increasingly prevalent today. The ``simple and objective'' methods are broadly interpreted as bibliometrics, that is, citation data and the statistics derived from them.

297,"The number of scientific publications is constantly rising, increasing the strain on the review process. The number of submissions is actually higher, as each manuscript is often reviewed several times before publication. To face the deluge of submissions, top journals reject a considerable fraction of manuscripts without review, potentially declining manuscripts with merit. The situation is frustrating for authors, reviewers and editors alike. Recently, several editors wrote about the ``tragedy of the reviewer commons', advocating for urgent corrections to the system. Almost every scientist has ideas on how to improve the system, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to perform experiments to test which measures would be most effective. Surprisingly, relatively few attempts have been made to model peer review. Here I implement a simulation framework in which ideas on peer review can be quantitatively tested. I incorporate authors, reviewers, manuscripts and journals into an agent-based model and a peer review system emerges from their interactions. As a proof-of-concept, I contrast an implementation of the current system, in which authors decide the journal for their submissions, with a system in which journals bid on manuscripts for publication. I show that, all other things being equal, this latter system solves most of the problems currently associated with the peer review process. Manuscripts' evaluation is faster, authors publish more and in better journals, and reviewers' effort is optimally utilized. However, more work is required from editors. This modeling framework can be used to test other solutions for peer review, leading the way for an improvement of how science is disseminated.","Allesina, Stefano",ArXiv e-prints,X0223d9ccb;X119dfc821;X1689eab18;X2bc3d99f0;X2dcd8dee3;X4c6c36dc9;X4ce878ba0;X57a7e63e6;X59e998919;X6839b8944;X69c01068b;X8bf52cc07;Xc0e477b81;Xc25e17f3a;Xf37f3b68b,15,Accelerating the pace of discovery by changing the peer review algorithm,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0344,2009
298,"In this paper we propose a novel approach aimed at building a new class of information system platforms which we call the ""Knowledge-work Support Systems"" or KwSS. KwSS can play a significant role in enhancing the IS support for knowledge management processes, including those customarily identified as less amenable to IS support. In our approach we try to enhance basic functionalities provided by the computer-based information systems, namely, that of improving the efficiency of the knowledge workers in accessing, processing and creating useful information. The improvement, along with proper focus on cultural, social and other aspects of the knowledge management processes, can enhance the workers' efficiency significantly in performing high quality knowledge works. In order to build the proposed approach, we develop several new concepts. The approach analyzes the information availability and usage from the knowledge workers and their works' perspectives and consequently brings forth more transparency in various aspects of information life-cycle with respect to knowledge management. KsSSes are technology platforms, which can be implemented independently as well as in conjunction with other knowledge management and data management technology platforms, to provide significant boost in the knowledge capabilities of organizations.","Laha, Arijit",ArXiv e-prints,X01cc0b4a7;X024ef0800;X056a67043;X0721750ae;X087007218;X0943ee7d4;X0a9994fed;X0c197029d;X0d626a665;X0ec21bd76;X117c9c8ee;X13016028b;X13551030a;X155e47054;X16d72bb67;X16f43ee63;X1a2ea5c76;X1d1a177ff;X1f818d350;X20ccc016a;X229038aa5;X290787e87;X29508e532;X2b24e6ba3;X2c55bbf38;X2c78dbeb8;X2e5a43cf2;X2f1572fb4;X32fc21029;X33bcf8ce9;X346a2f1b0;X35a66da95;X3616cc9c3;X37d057740;X3aae1cf33;X3b46d28bf;X492d2ed04;X4975c5e14;X4a530c133;X4b93d090c;X4ba19600a;X4c37e91f1;X4d0dd92c7;X4e1e4321e;X4f2527e9b;X50231945e;X51163bb3d;X5136f80f3;X51d946f97;X573bdceef;X58ded6c6a;X5b78fdcf3;X5c13a71db;X5cd798a54;X5d49d6769;X5eec866ce;X5f973ee81;X6096bbb78;X61a83105a;X62f0a5657;X631a2b7c0;X636e2a0df;X64a034b83;X65b46332a;X65ba71d1a;X67e0d3e53;X68716c8d2;X6928ba6f2;X6bfca1699;X70e276c0b;X71de739f8;X720643bcf;X72b9e64ac;X734760a14;X7501955ae;X76f2d5d28;X7703c65d6;X78a2dc184;X7a2fb518d;X7b7d0e84e;X7c37cd65b;X7f2e4364a;X7ffa9d982;X817a67d4e;X81c3a0499;X8467a2be8;X8567055aa;X864c12245;X8951399f1;X8b9a3d47f;X8ba0d016f;X8c7bec486;X8e3e4d28c;X90035c1e5;X914650451;X931dbe083;X937c0ed05;X93d624013;X96185fbf0;X963f87acb;X9755160f7;X99f839f72;X9b18fcc7b;X9bd59b107;X9d279efc0;Xa248c70da;Xa294c6253;Xa348d1a0a;Xa3ab1a559;Xa48658d9a;Xa56fc5554;Xa5ee08a74;Xa6d433ef7;Xa7bdb4a7b;Xa83594d64;Xab7663bcd;Xabcaee7f7;Xae8196ae4;Xb28d16a1f;Xb2ad8286f;Xb4a7a998c;Xb53cf31fc;Xb8abba640;Xb8fd111a5;Xb9f27fb53;Xbdc261026;Xbe0471f8c;Xbf89105b6;Xc00ed99af;Xc042fc2ee;Xc25e17f3a;Xc29f932e5;Xc4cef41ae;Xc9554cc9a;Xc9ec41580;Xca2a7ddd2;Xcde2c151c;Xd1555c1f9;Xd160e0a0c;Xd454ba5b2;Xd870a3161;Xd9f83bd17;Xdb123611c;Xdb75b316f;Xdc730d113;Xdd08d263c;Xde24f0894;Xdf411b318;Xe0131e054;Xe02a8bb98;Xe038ea88c;Xe149667b5;Xe1cdcde0b;Xe1eefa9d1;Xe20fa89ef;Xe26b516e1;Xe27dd5da7;Xe46c2b7ba;Xe5e99a3ce;Xeb71ae456;Xebca0602b;Xed49df306;Xef4032e26;Xf1f322b5b;Xf4e7b3015;Xf60f788cc;Xf62d23dd3;Xf63f1e5b0;Xf793e9afc;Xf79f86ebe;Xf83ce7fb1;Xf91269ee7;Xf91c4f34e;Xfa7786611;Xfad1b5943;Xfb7ba5970;Xfbecd31c7;Xfc8023a3f;Xfd9197df1;Xfdfa40d02,180,A theoretical foundation for building Knowledge-work Support Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5386,2009

300,"The Web is ephemeral. Many resources have representations that change over time, and many of those representations are lost forever. A lucky few manage to reappear as archived resources that carry their own URIs. For example, some content management systems maintain version pages that reflect a frozen prior state of their changing resources. Archives recurrently crawl the web to obtain the actual representation of resources, and subsequently make those available via special-purpose archived resources. In both cases, the archival copies have URIs that are protocol-wise disconnected from the URI of the resource of which they represent a prior state. Indeed, the lack of temporal capabilities in the most common Web protocol, HTTP, prevents getting to an archived resource on the basis of the URI of its original. This turns accessing archived resources into a significant discovery challenge for both human and software agents, which typically involves following a multitude of links from the original to the archival resource, or of searching archives for the original URI. This paper proposes the protocol-based Memento solution to address this problem, and describes a proof-of-concept experiment that includes major servers of archival content, including Wikipedia and the Internet Archive. The Memento solution is based on existing HTTP capabilities applied in a novel way to add the temporal dimension. The result is a framework in which archived resources can seamlessly be reached via the URI of their original: protocol-based time travel for the Web.","Van de Sompel, Herbert;Nelson, Michael L.;Sanderson, Robert;Balakireva, Lyudmila L.;Ainsworth, Scott;Shankar, Harihar",ArXiv e-prints,X074b511be;X09e015ebc;X0fe6f4cb1;X11637598e;X16bea4631;X19e30bbbb;X1b8049adf;X1cf9a4229;X1daa5c05c;X213bd7f9b;X21535d7b6;X238bcc0e5;X248ccd9a1;X24bb76f67;X2869cfa71;X2f00f810b;X3141702f5;X315cb814c;X31a314940;X324aae21a;X33b44ace6;X3abbd8ddb;X3d44d5af4;X4213d78fd;X457517fd5;X4b15430f7;X4c2b1a09b;X4d19ee902;X50d77b066;X52ab5cf61;X543326b8c;X563d992d9;X5b852e81e;X5f7ee8b6f;X68c75730f;X6bac1b980;X7188a8017;X763c6e04f;X7663d3f76;X786f1e339;X7a2bd9a23;X7be96c0c5;X7d7e89c21;X7de5bacd0;X82d39c43f;X84ec778c7;X864fb79aa;X886d592e3;X8b6bab8a1;X8e8bb2c6d;X8ecb588bf;X8f2f2b16d;X8fa9afa0a;X92ccb10aa;X96227689b;X9669de2af;X98474e21e;X9eb2b3d62;Xa38f8e0ee;Xae5bd24ee;Xaf75535f4;Xb393549e8;Xb8b66d7c3;Xb8bf7e292;Xb98a84eac;Xc0975f32d;Xc25e17f3a;Xc5dfeba98;Xcb2d213da;Xcf341883c;Xd1bbe19f5;Xd727983b3;Xd9c0be951;Xe02105665;Xe0a11d776;Xe6bc37bbc;Xe7b076766;Xe8f3eaccb;Xe9f055bb5;Xecad729f9;Xeefb666da;Xef032ec62;Xfc300068d;Xfe38d5ab7;Xff4f16b69,85,Memento: Time Travel for the Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1112,2009
301,"The current communication presents a simple exercise with the aim of solving a singular problem: the retrieval of extremely large amounts of items in the Web of Science interface. As it is known, Web of Science interface allows a user to obtain at most 100,000 items from a single query. But what about queries that achieve a result of more than 100,000 items? The exercise developed one possible way to achieve this objective. The case study is the retrieval of the entire scientific production from the United States in a specific year. Different sections of items were retrieved using the field Source of the database. Then, a simple Boolean statement was created with the aim of eliminating overlapping and to improve the accuracy of the search strategy. The importance of team work in the development of advanced search strategies was noted.","Arencibia-Jorge, Ricardo;Leydesdorff, Loet;Chinchilla-Rodriguez, Zaida;Rousseau, Ronald;Paris, Soren W.",ArXiv e-prints,5547cae46d;X0e32d32de;X1374852a5;X47d9ccbed;X6702e03f7;X774c8464f;X96f2e38b3;Xa1d7b19e8;Xc25e17f3a;Xda92c21cf;Xe438e51bd;Xe4c196aa2;Xf37f3b68b,13,Retrieval of very large numbers of items in the Web of Science: an exercise to develop accurate search strategies,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1305,2009
302,"Citation and publication profiles are gaining importance for the evaluation of top researchers when it comes to the appropriation of funding for excellence programs or career promotion judgments. Indicators like the Normalized Mean Citation Rate, the hindex or other distinguishing measures are increasingly used to picture the characteristics of individual scholars. Using bibliometric techniques for individual assessment is known to be particularly delicate, as the chance of errors being averaged away becomes smaller whereas a minor incompleteness can have a significant influence on the evaluation outcome.

304,"Discursive knowledge emerges as codification in flows of communication. The flows of communication are constrained and enabled by networks of communications as their historical manifestations at each moment of time. New publications modify the existing networks by changing the distributions of attributes and relations in document sets, while the networks are self-referentially updated along trajectories. Codification operates reflexively: the network structures are reconstructed from the perspective of hindsight. Codification along different axes differentiates discursive knowledge into specialties. These intellectual control structures are constructed bottom-up, but feed top-down back upon the production of new knowledge. However, the forward dynamics of diffusion in the development of the communication networks along trajectories differs from the feedback mechanisms of control. Analysis of the development of scientific communication in terms of evolving scientific literatures provides us with a model which makes these evolutionary processes amenable to measurement.","Lucio-Arias, Diana;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X16803a983;X4602662ff;X55fe533ab;Xa9157de34;Xc25e17f3a;Xe4c196aa2;Xf37f3b68b,7,"The Dynamics of Exchanges and References among Scientific Texts, and the Autopoiesis of Discursive Knowledge",http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1308,2009

The assumption that citation and publication practices are homogenous within specialties and fields of science is invalid. Furthermore, the delineation of fields and among specialties is fuzzy.

The match between the citation index and institutional profiles varies among institutional units and nations. The respective matches may heavily affect the representation of the units.

311,"The debate about which similarity measure one should use for the normalization in the case of Author Co-citation Analysis (ACA) is further complicated when one distinguishes between the symmetrical co-citation--or, more generally, co-occurrence--matrix and the underlying asymmetrical citation--occurrence--matrix. In the Web environment, the approach of retrieving original citation data is often not feasible. In that case, one should use the Jaccard index, but preferentially after adding the number of total citations (occurrences) on the main diagonal. Unlike Salton's cosine and the Pearson correlation, the Jaccard index abstracts from the shape of the distributions and focuses only on the intersection and the sum of the two sets. Since the correlations in the co-occurrence matrix may partially be spurious, this property of the Jaccard index can be considered as an advantage in this case.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X206d844a5;X2b30b1aee;X4e1320b1b;X4ec55c962;X5741e9895;X65697f95a;X7102cc172;X8294a1d5e;X8a9895ad3;X90e22c304;X917a84a13;X99795ca18;Xc07785bd5;Xc25e17f3a;Xc48e9ddb6;Xc605dae7d;Xc769386a0;Xdcf416fae;Xdf0aa4242;Xe0506150c;Xe5a7874fd;Xf5b848a0a,22,On the Normalization and Visualization of Author Co-Citation Data Salton's Cosine versus the Jaccard Index,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1447,2009
312,"During the last decade, we have witnessed a sustained growth of South Korea's research output in terms of the world share of publications in the Science Citation Index database. However, Korea's citation performance is not yet as competitive as publication performance. In this study, the authors examine the intellectual structure of Korean S&T field based on social network analysis of journal-journal citation data using the ten Korean SCI journals as seed journals. The results reveal that Korean SCI journals function more like publication places, neither research channels nor information sources among national scientists. Thus, these journals may provide Korean scholars with access to international scientific communities by facilitating the respective entry barriers. However, there are no citation relations based on their Korean background.

315,"In many countries and at European level, research policy increasingly focuses on 'excellent' researchers. The concept of excellence however is complex and multidimensional. For individual scholars it involves talents for innovative knowledge creation and successful transmission to peers, as well as management capacities. Excellence is also a comparative concept, implying the ability to surpass others [TIJSSEN, 2003]. Grants are in general awarded based on assessments by expert committees. While peer review is a widely accepted practice, it nevertheless is also subject to criticism. At higher aggregation levels, peer assessments are often supported by quantitative measures. At individual level, most of these measures are much less appropriate and there is a need for new, dedicated indicators.","Rons, Nadine;Amez, Lucy",ArXiv e-prints,X0e69a8284;Xb5327d4e8;Xea615232b,3,Impact Vitality - A Measure for Excellent Scientists,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6770,2013

Findings: The size and shape of the citation networks of journals can differ substantially, even if in a broadly similar category. Heterodox economics cannot (yet) be considered as an integrated specialty: authors in several journals in heterodox economics cite more from mainstream economics than from other heterodox journals.

The user is thus able to analyze the citation environment in terms of links and graphs. Furthermore, the local impact of a journal is defined as its share of the total citations in the specific journal's citation environments; the vertical size of the nodes is varied proportionally to this citation impact. The horizontal size of each node can be used to provide the same information after correction for within-journal (self)-citations. In the ""citing"" environment, the equivalents of this measure can be considered as a citation activity index which maps how the relevant journal environment is perceived by the collective of authors of a given journal.

318,"This paper explores a new indicator of journal citation impact, denoted as source normalized impact per paper (SNIP). It measures a journal's contextual citation impact, taking into account characteristics of its properly defined subject field, especially the frequency at which authors cite other papers in their reference lists, the rapidity of maturing of citation impact, and the extent to which a database used for the assessment covers the field's literature. It further develops Eugene Garfield's notions of a field's 'citation potential' defined as the average length of references lists in a field and determining the probability of being cited, and the need in fair performance assessments to correct for differences between subject fields. A journal's subject field is defined as the set of papers citing that journal. SNIP is defined as the ratio of the journal's citation count per paper and the citation potential in its subject field. It aims to allow direct comparison of sources in different subject fields. Citation potential is shown to vary not only between journal subject categories - groupings of journals sharing a research field - or disciplines (e.g., journals in mathematics, engineering and social sciences tend to have lower values than titles in life sciences), but also between journals within the same subject category. For instance, basic journals tend to show higher citation potentials than applied or clinical journals, and journals covering emerging topics higher than periodicals in classical subjects or more general journals. SNIP corrects for such differences. Its strengths and limitations are critically discussed, and suggestions are made for further research. All empirical results are derived from Elsevier's Scopus.","Moed, Henk F.",ArXiv e-prints,X003b4b080;X01e378892;X042c7a307;X04444dc07;X07c20c0b2;X0954e8445;X0ba2fe490;X0c969299c;X0cbda5056;X0e8d0d164;X120139485;X12e9ba93a;X13160d083;X14d7a390d;X152af9f17;X19ac28571;X1cff3d2bc;X1d54a57b9;X1d90e9973;X1fb1e0e6f;X224bb81bd;X23fb80433;X250ae5510;X267288b22;X28c30a597;X2b2544bd2;X2b3d2e2f9;X2b478c887;X2ec6d36dd;X2ef8a4546;X318c7c93d;X33f80076e;X34a16a953;X3680c0036;X37206498f;X3762a024e;X38754a010;X3996927a8;X3d5bf6654;X3f82c45ef;X3fc04663f;X41bb642bd;X4200ffe89;X44eedc243;X4526f18d7;X465059785;X46d54ee39;X47de9ede8;X48219824e;X48221d263;X4aae80b86;X4c1b6d5d2;X4fa07d87a;X51c3e7a2a;X527d043c7;X540200353;X572370130;X58cbd24c5;X5d2e3470e;X5d2f1264f;X5ef4fb1e4;X5f527aaf3;X6023f7150;X617115be6;X6400ac9ff;X643c0b46f;X681ba33a8;X692fd8af2;X6974142b8;X6b5393307;X6c74a1aa2;X6dbc95176;X6fdb79841;X702f6e75a;X70662c615;X7076ed30b;X726b701ed;X736dad4a0;X758ff917c;X77be15b0e;X77eede5f5;X78bfe46a5;X78cf85040;X7aa1ab1bb;X7b1ca32c4;X7d9c81474;X8038843cf;X81e4330f8;X8249adb30;X8390cb901;X8491b9745;X84bc81046;X86c487c6e;X8850fca4a;X887b686be;X898d74472;X8a35efc78;X8fb486f5b;X920cfb821;X94074de5d;X95e70d2ff;X972650f9a;X989088e52;X9aae98ccc;X9ad702c8d;X9cf88ff37;X9ff0f4946;Xa1b994b71;Xa20578d05;Xa31d301b0;Xaac8cab6c;Xaaf950212;Xabdb39563;Xae914cef1;Xae95def6d;Xaf79a999a;Xafc83bd12;Xafe1ea12b;Xb139ea087;Xb1875d7bd;Xb2afdee4a;Xb2e5a8490;Xb50e05f0b;Xb5b226e11;Xb6b31ee28;Xb739f61d1;Xb8dd1b57e;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbea0690a0;Xbfeddf785;Xc0c4af641;Xc25e17f3a;Xc4a40f427;Xc4ffa59ab;Xc698911f6;Xc73163f81;Xc7f61bb6d;Xc8e93079e;Xc9c981219;Xcb3c77df9;Xce1afae47;Xd011d9c1b;Xd016edce6;Xd47ba5640;Xd49d9ff73;Xd5542f8d5;Xd66728cf5;Xd804b49f6;Xd83103ee3;Xd8a317179;Xdad2f706f;Xdbb0c853d;Xdccc4acc3;Xe09d8f8db;Xe5e93ee1d;Xe8eae89fd;Xe92a65845;Xebdcccda0;Xef1fe5909;Xf18172b97;Xf39dcdc4f;Xf3b223276;Xf8dd19661;Xf9a17e9a8;Xf9bef675d;Xfa49946f2;Xfe38d5ab7;Xfe62b43c2;Xffb81eea8,170,Measuring contextual citation impact of scientific journals,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2632,2009

Local citation impact of journals is defined as the share of the total citations in a local citation environment, which is expressed as a ratio and can be visualized by the size of the nodes. The vertical size of the nodes varies proportionally to a journal's total citation share, while the horizontal size of the nodes is used to provide citation information after correction for the within-journal (self-) citations. In this study, we analyze citation impacts of three Chinese journals in mathematics and compare local citation impacts with impact factors. Local citation impacts reflect a journal's status and function better than (global) impact factors. We also found that authors in Chinese journals prefer international instead of domestic ones as sources for their citations.","Zhou, Ping;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X1a26e33a8;Xa1bce911e;Xc25e17f3a;Xe4869c9d2;Xe4c196aa2,5,The Citation Impacts and Citation Environments of Chinese Journals in Mathematics,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3091,2009

325,"The citation impact of Environment and Planning B can be visualized using its citation relations with journals in its environment as the links of a network. The size of the nodes is varied in correspondence to the relative citation impact in this environment. Additionally, one can correct for the effect of within-journal ""self""-citations. The network can be partitioned and clustered using algorithms from social network analysis. After transposing the matrix in terms of rows and columns, the citing patterns can be mapped analogously. Citing patterns reflect the activity of the community of authors who publish in the journal, while being cited indicates reception.

326,"The aggregated citation relations among journals included in the Science Citation Index provide us with a huge matrix which can be analyzed in various ways. Using principal component analysis or factor analysis, the factor scores can be used as indicators of the position of the cited journals in the citing dimensions of the database. Unrotated factor scores are exact, and the extraction of principal components can be made stepwise since the principal components are independent. Rotation may be needed for the designation, but in the rotated solution a model is assumed. This assumption can be legitimated on pragmatic or theoretical grounds. Since the resulting outcomes remain sensitive to the assumptions in the model, an unambiguous classification is no longer possible in this case. However, the factor-analytic solutions allow us to test classifications against the structures contained in the database.

The resulting journal impact rankings were compared to the ISI IF. Results indicate that, although social network metrics and ISI IF rankings deviate moderately for citation-based journal networks, they differ considerably for journal networks derived from download data. We believe the results represent a unique aspect of general journal impact that is not captured by the ISI IF. These results furthermore raise questions regarding the validity of the ISI IF as the sole assessment of journal impact, and suggest the possibility of devising impact metrics based on usage information in general.","Bollen, J.;de Sompel, H.

329,"Logarithmic transformation of the data has been recommended by the literature in the case of highly skewed distributions such as those commonly found in information science. The purpose of the transformation is to make the data conform to the lognormal law of error for inferential purposes. How does this transformation affect the analysis? We factor analyze and visualize the citation environment of the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) before and after a logarithmic transformation. The transformation strongly reduces the variance necessary for classificatory purposes and therefore is counterproductive to the purposes of the descriptive statistics. We recommend against the logarithmic transformation when sets cannot be defined unambiguously.

330,"From its inception, a large part of the motivation for Cognitive Science has been the need for an interdisciplinary journal for the study of minds and intelligent systems. One threat to the interdisciplinarity of Cognitive Science, both the field and journal, is that it may become, or already be, too dominated by psychologists. In 2005, psychology was a keyword for 51% of submissions, followed distantly by linguistics (17%), artificial intelligence (13%), neuroscience (10%), computer science (9%), and philosophy (8%). The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) gathers data not only on how individual articles cite one another, but also on macroscopic citation patterns among journals. Journals or sets of journals can be considered as proxies for fields. As fields become established, they often create journals. By studying the patterns of citations among journals that cite and are cited by Cognitive Science, we can better: 1) appreciate the scholarly ecology surrounding the journal and the journals role within this ecology, 2) establish competitor and alternate journals, and 3) determine the natural clustering of fields related to cognitive science.","Goldstone, Rob;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,5547c76560;X4677311da;X47d9ccbed;X736a3282d;Xc25e17f3a;Xda92c21cf;Xe017a8aba;Xe4c196aa2;Xf37f3b68b,9,The Import and Export of Cognitive Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3641,2009
331,"Co-occurrence matrices, such as co-citation, co-word, and co-link matrices, have been used widely in the information sciences. However, confusion and controversy have hindered the proper statistical analysis of this data. The underlying problem, in our opinion, involved understanding the nature of various types of matrices. This paper discusses the difference between a symmetrical co-citation matrix and an asymmetrical citation matrix as well as the appropriate statistical techniques that can be applied to each of these matrices, respectively. Similarity measures (like the Pearson correlation coefficient or the cosine) should not be applied to the symmetrical co-citation matrix, but can be applied to the asymmetrical citation matrix to derive the proximity matrix. The argument is illustrated with examples. The study then extends the application of co-occurrence matrices to the Web environment where the nature of the available data and thus data collection methods are different from those of traditional databases such as the Science Citation Index. A set of data collected with the Google Scholar search engine is analyzed using both the traditional methods of multivariate analysis and the new visualization software Pajek that is based on social network analysis and graph theory.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Vaughan, Liwen",ArXiv e-prints,X07ee741e5;X0856d0bf4;X14dda72e0;X15a5a1b69;X176870a8f;X245bf104b;X26ebcd7a1;X2d22ade50;X464ba2932;X473b8caed;X569793c5b;X62e2b5728;X8c0bfb7a7;X8d9f3af4d;X8ed9e178c;X926cca53c;X9bec5b971;Xa062c3991;Xa6480245d;Xa80605092;Xacc978b78;Xb59fb4d9a;Xbe97edcad;Xc003275e5;Xc25e17f3a;Xcb7663d4b;Xccd5284dd;Xd00929943;Xded166ee7;Xe438cf5a4;Xe47302981;Xe4c196aa2;Xec3e0b62a;Xf381e4948;Xf60e5d7e4;Xfb6a05edb;Xfc796ddfe;Xff1610fdf,38,Co-occurrence Matrices and their Applications in Information Science: Extending ACA to the Web Environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3422,2009
332,"Many investigations of scientific collaboration are based on statistical analyses of large networks constructed from bibliographic repositories. These investigations often rely on a wealth of bibliographic data, but very little or no other information about the individuals in the network, and thus, fail to illustrate the broader social and academic landscape in which collaboration takes place. In this article, we perform an in-depth longitudinal analysis of a relatively small network of scientific collaboration (N = 291) constructed from the bibliographic record of a research center involved in the development and application of sensor network and wireless technologies. We perform a preliminary analysis of selected structural properties of the network, computing its range, configuration and topology. We then support our preliminary statistical analysis with an in-depth temporal investigation of the assortative mixing of selected node characteristics, unveiling the researchers' propensity to collaborate preferentially with others with a similar academic profile.

When these are used in conjunction with the rich legacy data archives, the opportunities for scientific discovery multiply rapidly. A Virtual Observatory (VO) framework will enable transparent and efficient access, search, retrieval, and visualization of data across multiple data repositories, which are generally heterogeneous and distributed. Aspects of data mining that apply to a variety of science user scenarios with a VO are reviewed. The development of a VO should address the data mining needs of various astronomical research constituencies. By way of example, two user scenarios are presented which invoke applications and linkages of data across the catalog and image domains in order to address specific astrophysics research problems.

334,"When using scientific literature to model scholarly discourse, a research specialty can be operationalized as an evolving set of related documents. Each publication can be expected to contribute to the further development of the specialty at the research front. The specific combinations of title words and cited references in a paper can then be considered as a signature of the knowledge claim in the paper: new words and combinations of words can be expected to represent variation, while each paper is at the same time selectively positioned into the intellectual organization of a field using context-relevant references. Can the mutual information among these three dimensions--title words, cited references, and sequence numbers--be used as an indicator of the extent to which intellectual organization structures the uncertainty prevailing at a research front? The effect of the discovery of nanotubes (1991) on the previously existing field of fullerenes is used as a test case.

337,"This paper focuses on methods to study patterns of collaboration in co-authorship networks at the mesoscopic level. We combine qualitative methods (participant interviews) with quantitative methods (network analysis) and demonstrate the application and value of our approach in a case study comparing three research fields in chemistry. A mesoscopic level of analysis means that in addition to the basic analytic unit of the individual researcher as node in a co-author network, we base our analysis on the observed modular structure of co-author networks. We interpret the clustering of authors into groups as bibliometric footprints of the basic collective units of knowledge production in a research specialty. We find two types of coauthor-linking patterns between author clusters that we interpret as representing two different forms of cooperative behavior, transfer-type connections due to career migrations or one-off services rendered, and stronger, dedicated inter-group collaboration. Hence the generic coauthor network of a research specialty can be understood as the overlay of two distinct types of cooperative networks between groups of authors publishing in a research specialty. We show how our analytic approach exposes field specific differences in the social organization of research.","Velden, Theresa A.;Haque, Asif-ul;Lagoze, Carl J.",ArXiv e-prints,X05e8435fd;X1a38ee6ca;X1ae20b794;X250ae5510;X268245284;X26ebcd7a1;X2897f0783;X29193ba9c;X2a0ab0cf0;X31b01a900;X3b08028f1;X3e11b0f57;X3e3426f36;X472f214e4;X4b21e1eba;X4f773a785;X4fa8cc7c0;X4fe498315;X5695e7e26;X580c6c903;X6926dcb21;X6b161e37c;X6b59d2fc2;X7385628cc;X7fcb64047;X81eef1b79;X8234644ab;X8882bcb0b;X894e27e42;X8e8bb2c6d;X901e7a1e6;X96125a7f4;X9b9ec0683;X9c46fdb05;Xa2ab6a346;Xa3c072c65;Xad8b86afc;Xb52e6ff09;Xbbfa280ed;Xbc93f02b4;Xbe98cd561;Xc015ee02b;Xc25e17f3a;Xc3e05c5ad;Xc4ffa59ab;Xca719cf0a;Xcc0fb0500;Xd82e746e7;Xda13a0eec;Xdd15193ef;Xe017a8aba;Xe0af56950;Xf1677bf27;Xf41553b2a;Xf52d1b31b;Xf541d2b5a;Xf79048aaa,57,A New Approach to Analyzing Patterns of Collaboration in Co-authorship Networks - Mesoscopic Analysis and Interpretation,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4761,2009

339,"Bibliometric analysis has firmly conquered its place as an instrument for evaluation and international comparison of performance levels. Consequently, differences in coverage by standard bibliometric databases installed a dichotomy between on the one hand the well covered 'exact' sciences, and on the other hand most of the social sciences and humanities with a more limited coverage (Nederhof, 2006). Also the latter domains need to be able to soundly demonstrate their level of performance and claim or legitimate funding accordingly. An important part of the output volume in social sciences appears as books, book chapters and national literature (Hicks, 2004). To proceed from publication data to performance measurement, quantitative publication counts need to be combined with qualitative information, for example from peer assessment or validation (European Expert Group on Assessment of University-Based Research, 2010), to identify those categories that represent research quality as perceived by peers. An accurate focus is crucial in order to stimulate, recognize and reward high quality achievements only. This paper demonstrates how such a selection of publication categories can be based on correlations with peer judgments. It is also illustrated that the selection should be sufficiently precise, to avoid subcategories negatively correlated with peer judgments. The findings indicate that, also in social sciences and humanities, publications in journals with an international referee system are the most important category for evaluating quality. Book chapters with international referee system and contributions in international conference proceedings follow them.","Rons, Nadine;De Bruyn, Arlette",ArXiv e-prints,X250ae5510;X3d63c7b04,2,"Quality related publication categories in social sciences and humanities, based on a university's peer review assessments",http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6773,2013

346,"University-industry-government relations provide a networked infrastructure for knowledge-based innovation systems. This infrastructure organizes the dynamic fluxes locally and the knowledge base remains emergent given these conditions. Whereas the relations between the institutions can be measured as variables, the interacting fluxes generate a probabilistic entropy. The mutual information among the three institutional dimensions provides us with an indicator of this entropy. When this indicator is negative, self-organization can be expected. The self-organizing dynamic may temporarily be stabilized in the overlay of communications among the carrying agencies.

Furthermore, many of the institutions and individuals who might participate in OLAC do not have the technical resources to support the OAI protocol.

In particular we refer to the need to promote CoRR more effectively for its intended community - computer scientists in universities, industrial research labs and in government.

349,"Seismology has several features that suggest it is a highly internationalized field: the subject matter is global, the tools used to analyse seismic waves are dependent upon information technologies, and governments are interested in funding cooperative research. We explore whether an emerging field like seismology has a more internationalised structure than the older, related field of geophysics. Using aggregated journal-journal citations, we first show that, within the citing environment, seismology emerged from within geophysics as its own field in the 1990s. The bibliographic analysis, however, does not show that seismology is more internationalised than geophysics: in 2000, seismology had a lower percentage of all articles co-authored on an international basis. Nevertheless, social network analysis shows that the core group of cooperating countries within seismology is proportionately larger and more distributed than that within geophysics. While the latter exhibits an established network with a hierarchy, the formation of a field in terms of new partnership relations is ongoing in seismology.","Wagner, Caroline S.;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X1f412f5c2;X24ec0a821;X4078e6feb;X45978c3c3;X6736fdbcc;Xc25e17f3a;Xe4c196aa2;Xe7f92112d;Xf04a57d28,9,"A study of seismology as a dynamic, distributed area of scientific research",http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1371,2009
350,"The profusion of online digital images presents new challenges for image indexing. Images have always been problematic to describe and catalogue due to lack of inherent textual data and ambiguity of meaning. An alternative to time-consuming professionally-applied metadata has been sought in the form of tags, simple keywords that form a flat structure known as distributed classification, or more popularly as a folksonomy. This research aims to increase understanding of why people tag and how effective they find it for searching, using as the focus. Open-ended questionnaires were sent out to members of the photo-sharing website Flickr, with the opportunity to post comments to an online discussion space. There is also a systematic comparison between a tag-based system and a more traditional controlled vocabulary, to test out the claims made regarding the suitability of tagging for searching and browsing. For this purpose Flickr has been compared with Getty Images using a series of test themes. The small number of people who replied to the questionnaire gave detailed answers that confirmed several assertions made about tags: they are accepted despite their flaws (sloppiness and potential for inaccuracy) because they serve their purpose to a satisfactory level. Some answers challenged the assumption that tagging is only done for personal benefit. The search comparison found that while Getty allows highly specific queries and logical semantic links, Flickr is more flexible and better placed to deal with subtle concepts. The overall conclusion is that tags achieve most when used in conjunction with groupings of people with a shared interest.","Piker, Samuel",ArXiv e-prints,X04effcad4;X04f497df4;X0ab4af66c;X0c48cbcc7;X0cb254088;X0e5f08279;X116629efb;X13503c58a;X16304dcee;X1a487e9e6;X1fc67edd3;X379b90063;X479df81f5;X48fca794b;X49cdfede4;X53ae7d376;X55d335871;X562e9f36f;X5b72b34cb;X69e032e09;X6b82f4f9c;X6bfc76615;X7f555c6da;X7f8394d69;X80d41f489;X82788635c;X859172c54;X8a224ed34;X9560745f3;X972d6450e;X9b1fc97fd;Xa3d1b3e1b;Xa4b2d298d;Xa56c318ed;Xae7d442d6;Xb293245bc;Xb375e05c7;Xbadf6241d;Xbba7e7fde;Xbc812f58f;Xbcb58a407;Xbea40387e;Xc12a2e5fb;Xc25e17f3a;Xc4b25943c;Xc9ac25519;Xca20dbb99;Xcb798ab25;Xd1cd9f856;Xdc32a33b7;Xdcd04bbcf;Xe2e07c4ad;Xe7c9b260d;Xf4ac37371;Xf61b9f254,55,"An evaluation of Flickrs distributed classification system, from the perspective of its members, and as an image retrieval tool in comparison with a controlled vocabulary",http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1767,2009

352,"Following my previous study of paper length vs. number of citations in astronomy (Stanek 2008), some colleagues expressed an interest in knowing if any correlation exists between citations and the number of authors on an astronomical paper. At least naively, one would expect papers with more authors to be cited more. I test this expectation with the same sample of papers as analyzed in Stanek (2008), selecting all (~30,000) refereed papers from A&A, AJ, ApJ and MNRAS published between 2000 and 2004. (...) I find that indeed papers with more authors are on average cited more, but only weakly so: roughly, the number of citations doubles with ten-fold increase in the number of authors. While the median number of citations to a 2 author paper is 17, the median number of citations to a paper with 10 to 20 authors is 32. I find that most of the papers are written by a small number of authors, with a mode of 2 authors and a median of 3 authors. I also find that papers with more authors are not longer than papers with fewer authors, in fact a median number of 8 to 10 pages per paper holds for any number of authors. For the same sample of papers, a median number of citations per paper grew from 15 in June 2008 (Stanek 2008) to 19 in November 2009.

353,"In a context of ever more specialized scientists, interdisciplinarity receives increasing attention as innovating ideas are often situated where the disciplines meet. In many countries science policy makers installed dedicated funding programs and policies. This induces a need for specific tools for their support. There is however not yet a generally accepted quantitative method or set of criteria to recognize and evaluate interdisciplinary research outputs (Tracking and evaluating interdisciplinary research: metrics and maps, 12th ISSI Conference, 2009). Interdisciplinarity also takes on very different forms, as distinguished in overviews from the first codifications (Klein, 1990) to the latest reference work (Frodeman et al., 2010). In the specific context of research measurement and evaluation, interdisciplinarity was discussed e.g. by Rinia (2007) and Porter et al. (2006). This empirical study aims to contribute to the understanding and the measuring of interdisciplinary research at the micro level, in the form of new synergies between disciplines. Investigation of a specialized funding program shows how a new interdisciplinary synergy and its citation impact are visible in co-publications and cocitations, and that these are important parameters for assessment.

355,"In December 2003, seventeen years after the first UK research assessment exercise, Italy started up its first-ever national research evaluation, with the aim to evaluate, using the peer review method, the excellence of the national research production. The evaluation involved 20 disciplinary areas, 102 research structures, 18,500 research products and 6,661 peer reviewers (1,465 from abroad); it had a direct cost of 3.55 millions Euros and a time length spanning over 18 months. The introduction of ratings based on ex post quality of output and not on ex ante respect for parameters and compliance is an important leap forward of the national research evaluation system toward meritocracy. From the bibliometric perspective, the national assessment offered the unprecedented opportunity to perform a large-scale comparison of peer review and bibliometric indicators for an important share of the Italian research production. The present investigation takes full advantage of this opportunity to test whether peer review judgements and (article and journal) bibliometric indicators are independent variables and, in the negative case, to measure the sign and strength of the association. Outcomes allow us to advocate the use of bibliometric evaluation, suitably integrated with expert review, for the forthcoming national assessment exercises, with the goal of shifting from the assessment of research excellence to the evaluation of average research performance without significant increase of expenses.","Franceschet, Massimo;Costantini, Antonio",ArXiv e-prints,X07ae95b00;X1eaf63bc1;X2e7c94a7e;X311e272c1;X66dac5fda;X6f3518853;X7c75e6b81;X99bba975d;Xa1b994b71,9,The first Italian research assessment exercise: a bibliometric perspective,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2601,2009

Therefore, teachers and students do not have available a set of unrelated units neither a limited set a few pre-packaged learning paths, as it is typical of some solutions on the Web, but rather will have a network of topics that can be serialized in a combinatorial vast number of alternatives, and therefore can create as many custom ebook, but guaranteed from the point of view of the scientific perspective.","Vincelli, Maria",ArXiv e-prints,X03d96b162;X0c664cec2;X0ef33d063;X1a773fe81;X1c279c653;X1c8a00c9a;X28e540e7f;X35d7895be;X36fe8cc54;X3c0cdf4f3;X3c8eaef05;X3fe26ee4d;X409ca3652;X418d35094;X44bff9a8d;X4ffafc61a;X53bc6b23c;X59beed672;X5c5c102e3;X610240f75;X6a6f97ec7;X6ef116512;X71caa3450;X749d78ca0;X80f682163;X8b6f425d5;X9107e1116;X9a938fbb2;Xa4aa28560;Xa5649fd2c;Xa63332687;Xb4cad4a41;Xb4e5d9548;Xb6b488e99;Xc1a6ac03d;Xc877ac5ee;Xd06dd4016;Xd5249c6be;Xd8942f127;Xe5f9f3261;Xe7701f5ce;Xeb192bce0;Xeef2f183d;Xf58a57be7;Xfb22ea972;Xfc8d3a075,46,Un modello di struttura dinamica per ebook scolastici,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6519,2011

Our framework combines in a content-driven bottom-up approach two different sources of information: textual and spatial. To analyze the text, shallow natural language processing tools, such as taggers and partial parsers, are used. To infer relations of the logical layout we resort to a qualitative spatial calculus closely related to Allen's calculus. We evaluate the system against documents from a color journal and present the results of extracting the reading order from the journal's pages. In this case, our analysis is successful as it extracts the intended reading order from the document.","Aiello, Marco;Monz, Christof;Todoran, Leon",ArXiv e-prints,X00aec6d50;X078482f74;X52574fa8a;X922527a77;Xc7c5df8a7;Xc867eb555;Xccc118003;Xd954efc50,8,Combining Linguistic and Spatial Information for Document Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0009014,2000

362,"Computer science is a relatively young discipline combining science, engineering, and mathematics. The main flavors of computer science research involve the theoretical development of conceptual models for the different aspects of computing and the more applicative building of software artifacts and assessment of their properties. In the computer science publication culture, conferences are an important vehicle to quickly move ideas, and journals often publish deeper versions of papers already presented at conferences. These peculiarities of the discipline make computer science an original research field within the sciences, and, therefore, the assessment of classical bibliometric laws is particularly important for this field. In this paper, we study the skewness of the distribution of citations to papers published in computer science publication venues (journals and conferences). We find that the skewness in the distribution of mean citedness of different venues combines with the asymmetry in citedness of articles in each venue, resulting in a highly asymmetric citation distribution with a power law tail. Furthermore, the skewness of conference publications is more pronounced than the asymmetry of journal papers. Finally, the impact of journal papers, as measured with bibliometric indicators, largely dominates that of proceeding papers.","Franceschet, Massimo",ArXiv e-prints,X2f228decc;X450e32142;X5e69513a7;X6a28cd31d;X833e45c26;X8a2a8ad8a;X904fbc981;X9248fcdf9;Xba6b39ce3;Xcadbf5111;Xda7b026af,11,The skewness of computer science,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4188,2009

364,"Innovative ideas are often situated where disciplines meet, and socio-economic problems generally require contributions from several disciplines. Ways to stimulate interdisciplinary research collaborations are therefore an increasing point of attention for science policy. There is concern that 'regular' funding programs, involving advice from disciplinary experts and discipline-bound viewpoints, may not adequately stimulate, select or evaluate this kind of research. This has led to specific policies aimed at interdisciplinary research in many countries. There is however at this moment no generally accepted method to adequately select and evaluate interdisciplinary research. In the vast context of different forms of interdisciplinarity, this paper aims to contribute to the debate on best practices to stimulate and support interdisciplinary research collaborations. It describes the selection procedures and results of a university program supporting networks formed 'bottom up', integrating expertise from different disciplines. The program's recent evaluation indicates that it is successful in selecting and supporting the interdisciplinary synergies aimed for, responding to a need experienced in the field. The analysis further confirms that potential for interdisciplinary collaboration is present in all disciplines.","Rons, Nadine",ArXiv e-prints,X0217d30ec;X036f6f00c;X1a6ee067b;X2b8d66d0e;X318494248;X344ab8778;X36fe06997;X3cb0e3116;X3eec72387;X3f8d8ac82;X496da95f7;X4b9f2d6ed;X4e964cbbd;X613a8c761;X6c2c62391;X6c4388dc7;X74e21bf2f;X852889d3c;X893105ef4;X8be2e968d;X8dfa2ec03;X970f8e95b;Xaea9becf4;Xb2c94a8f9;Xb5db18f00;Xba5651195;Xbd9e50593;Xc30b772c3;Xc47feb959;Xc624ccbf3;Xccac6254d;Xcf0883fb3;Xd81af98cf;Xe770b5d1f;Xef703f09e,35,Interdisciplinary Research Collaborations: Evaluation of a Funding Program,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6784,2013

366,"Articles whose authors make them Open Access (OA) by self-archiving them online are cited significantly more than articles accessible only to subscribers. Some have suggested that this ""OA Advantage"" may not be causal but just a self-selection bias, because authors preferentially make higher-quality articles OA. To test this we compared self-selective self-archiving with mandatory self-archiving for a sample of 27,197 articles published 2002-2006 in 1,984 journals. The OA Advantage proved just as high for both. Logistic regression showed that the advantage is independent of other correlates of citations (article age; journal impact factor; number of co-authors, references or pages; field; article type; or country) and greatest for the most highly cited articles. The OA Advantage is real, independent and causal, but skewed. Its size is indeed correlated with quality, just as citations themselves are (the top 20% of articles receive about 80% of all citations). The advantage is greater for the more citeable articles, not because of a quality bias from authors self-selecting what to make OA, but because of a quality advantage, from users self-selecting what to use and cite, freed by OA from the constraints of selective accessibility to subscribers only.","Gargouri, Yassine;Hajjem, Chawki;Larivière, Vincent;Gingras, Yves;Carr, Les;Brody, Tim;Harnad, Stevan",PLoS ONE,5394f7fd21;X0093af2dd;X00aec6d50;X03ab63edf;X243b94515;X250ae5510;X25d60accb;X313ed27d5;X315cb814c;X3247432de;X370afe1df;X3a80458c2;X584c50b14;X5aad950a9;X5d2f1264f;X5f6598883;X6478380ac;X79239b5ed;X7c32c1e25;X9482f9ca7;X95bdf1a64;X9e970c371;Xa1b994b71;Xb257c27b8;Xb287fb729;Xb28a642b7;Xc325f7e97;Xc55e07c3a;Xcb9c1a762;Xcee10cf4e;Xd3ada6f04;Xd3d24404d;Xdcc304077;Xe43dc6725;Xe54d2bc7b;Xe65aeec45;Xec635cbd0;Xec6e51643;Xf0c5b33c4;Xf3178b6ea;Xf55cefcd5;Xf957f541d;Xfa77c9a50,43,"Self-Selected or Mandated, Open Access Increases Citation Impact for Higher Quality Research",http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0361,2010
367,"To preserve access to digital content, we must preserve the representation information that captures the intended interpretation of the data. In particular, we must be able to capture performance dependency requirements, i.e. to identify the other resources that are required in order for the intended interpretation to be constructed successfully. Critically, we must identify the digital objects that are only referenced in the source data, but are embedded in the performance, such as fonts. This paper describes a new technique for analysing the dynamic dependencies of digital media, focussing on analysing the process that underlies the performance, rather than parsing and deconstructing the source data. This allows the results of format-specific characterisation tools to be verified independently, and facilitates the generation of representation information for any digital media format, even when no suitable characterisation tool exists.","Jackson, Andrew N.",ArXiv e-prints,X2a74e26ff;X36507bdef;X6ea0208c4;Xd31741260,4,Using Automated Dependency Analysis To Generate Representation Information,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0735,2011
368,"Inspired by interdisciplinary work touching biology and microtribology, the authors propose a new, dynamic way of publishing research results, the establishment of a tree of knowledge and the localisation of scientific articles on this tree. 'Technomimetics' is proposed as a new method of knowledge management in science and technology: it shall help find and organise information in an era of over-information. Such ways of presenting and managing research results would be accessible by people with different kinds of backgrounds and levels of education, and allow for full use of the ever- increasing number of scientific and technical publications. This approach would dramatically change and revolutionize the way we are doing science, and contribute to overcoming the three gaps between the world of ideas, inventors, innovators and investors as introduced by Gebeshuber, Gruber and Drack in 2009 for accelerated scientific and technological breakthroughs to improve the human condition. Inspiration for the development of above methods was the fact that - generally - tribologists and biologists do not see many overlaps of their professions. However, both deal with materials, structures and processes. Tribology is omnipresent in biology and many biological systems have impressive tribological properties. Tribologists can therefore get valuable input and inspiration from living systems. The aim of biomimetics is knowledge transfer from biology to technology and successful biomimetics in tribology needs collaboration between biologists and tribologists. Literature search shows that the number of papers regarding biotribology is steadily increasing. However, at the moment, most scientific papers of the other respective field are hard to access and hard to understand, in terms of concepts and specific wording.","Gebeshuber, I.

When institutional boundaries are increasingly blurred in a Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government relations, criteria for quality control in the production of scientific knowledge can be expected to change at the interfaces. The categorization in terms of two modes of knowledge production was introduced by Gibbons et al. (1994) in order to describe changes in the networks of scientific communications (funding patterns, research configurations, styles of knowledge management, etc.). These changes were mainly specified as institutional parameters in order to deal with the subjects of R&D management and S&T policies, that is, ex ante (Spiegel-Ring 1973 Van den Daele et al. 1979). We focus on the 'validation boundaries' emerging from the differences between Mode 1 and Mode 2 that is, on the criteria for quality control that can analytically and reflexively be brought to the fore ex post. The shift from an institutional frame of reference to a focus on the dynamics of communications enables us to clarify several problems in the discussion of the future of university research.","Fujigaki, Yuko;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X007a69dfb;X962ccfd60,2,Quality Control and Validation Boundaries in a Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government: 'Mode 2' and the Future of University Research,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1315,2010
370,"In this paper we describe a HepML format and a corresponding C++ library developed for keeping complete description of parton level events in a unified and flexible form. HepML tags contain enough information to understand what kind of physics the simulated events describe and how the events have been prepared. A HepML block can be included into event files in the LHEF format. The structure of the HepML block is described by means of several XML Schemas. The Schemas define necessary information for the HepML block and how this information should be located within the block. The library libhepml is a C++ library intended for parsing and serialization of HepML tags, and representing the HepML block in computer memory. The library is an API for external software. For example, Matrix Element Monte Carlo event generators can use the library for preparing and writing a header of an LHEF file in the form of HepML tags. In turn, Showering and Hadronization event generators can parse the HepML header and get the information in the form of C++ classes. libhepml can be used in C++, C, and Fortran programs. All necessary parts of HepML have been prepared and we present the project to the HEP community.

Various programs exist for these stages. In this article we are interested in interfacing different Monte Carlo event generators via data files, in particular, Matrix Element (ME) generators and Showering and Hadronization (SH) generators. There is a widely accepted format for data files for such interfaces - Les Houches Event Format (LHEF). Although information kept in an LHEF file is enough for proper working of SH generators, it is insufficient for understanding how events in the LHEF file have been prepared and which physical model has been applied. In this paper we propose an extension of the format for keeping additional information available in generators. We propose to add a new information block, marked up with XML tags, to the LHEF file. This block describes events in the file in more detail. In particular, it stores information about a physical model, kinematical cuts, generator, etc. This helps to make LHEF files self-documented. Certainly, HepML can be applied in more general context, not in LHEF files only. Solution method: In order to overcome drawbacks of the original LHEF accord we propose to add a new information block of HepML tags. HepML is an XML-based markup language. We designed several XML Schemas for all tags in the language. Any HepML document should follow rules of the Schemas. The language is equipped with a library for operation with HepML tags and documents. This C++ library, called libhepml, consists of classes for HepML objects, which represent a HepML document in computer memory, parsing classes, serializating classes, and some auxiliary classes. Restrictions: The software is adapted for solving problems, described in the article. There are no additional restrictions.

371,"Can self-organization of scientific communication be specified by using literature-based indicators? In this study, we explore this question by applying entropy measures to typical ""Mode-2"" fields of knowledge production. We hypothesized these scientific systems to be developing from a self-organization of the interaction between cognitive and institutional levels: European subsidized research programs aim at creating an institutional network, while a cognitive reorganization is continuously ongoing at the scientific field level. The results indicate that the European system develops towards a stable level of distribution of cited references and title-words among the European member states. We suggested that this distribution could be a property of the emerging European system. In order to measure to degree of specialization with respect to the respective distributions of countries, cited references and title words, the mutual information among the three frequency distributions was calculated. The so-called transmission values informed us that the European system shows increasing levels of differentiation.","Heimeriks, Gaston;Leydesdorff, Loet;Van den Besselaar, Peter",ArXiv e-prints,X3fb6e6225;X4b50171ae;X8fb4bcf43;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xdaeaef3db;Xe3991c878,7,"Distributed scientific communication in the European information society: Some cases of ""Mode 2"" fields of research",http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1320,2010
372,"We study the national production of academic knowledge in all Iberoamerican countries (IAC) between 1973 and 2007. We show that the total number of mainstream scientific publications listed in SCI,SSCI and A&HCI follows an exponential growth, the same as the national productivity expressed in the number of publications per capita. We also explore the temporal evolution of the co-authorship patterns between a sample of 12 IAC responsible for 98% of the total regional publications, with a group of other 45 nations. We show that the scientific co-authorship among countries follows a power-law and behaves as a self-organizing scale-free network, where each country appears as a node and each co-publication as a link. We develop a mathematical model to study the temporal evolution of co-authorship networks, based on a preferential attachment strategy and we show that the number of co-publications among countries growths quadraticly against time. We empirically determine the quadratic growth constants for 352 different networks within. We corroborate that the connectivity of regional countries with larger scientific networks is growing faster than with other less connected countries. We determine the dates, at which the co-authorship connectivities trigger the self-organizing scale free network for each of the 352 cases. We find that the last follows a normal distribution around year 1981.4 +/-2.2 and we connect the last effect with a brain-drainage process generated in the region. We show how the number of co-publications Pki (t) between country k and country i, is related with a power-law against the coupling growth coefficients aki.","Lemarchand, Guillermo A.",ArXiv e-prints,X137f16939;X2b6b44bfd;X2d90e5f86;X30cd2689b;X46be42b82;X55cf5973d;X5eb752ad3;X785816b7e;X8f2433510;Xf0e2e3aa5,10,"The long-term dynamics of co-authorship scientific networks, Iberoamerican Countries (1973-2006)",http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2837,2010

However, little is known about how the open data trend impacts a scientific community, specifically in terms of its collaboration behaviors. This paper aims to enhance our understanding of the dynamics of scientific collaboration in the open data eScience environment via a case study of co-author networks of an active and highly cited open data project, called Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We visualized the co-authoring networks and measured their properties over time at three levels: author, institution, and country levels. We compared these measurements to a random network model and also compared results across the three levels. The study found that 1) the collaboration networks of the SDSS community transformed from random networks to small-world networks; 2) the number of author-level collaboration instances has not changed much over time, while the number of collaboration instances at the other two levels has increased over time; 3) pairwise institutional collaboration become common in recent years.

As useful indicators for this performance dimension, this paper introduces the concept of milestones for research excellence, as points of transition to higher-level contributions at the leading edge of science. The proposed milestones are based on two indicators associated with research excellence, the impact vitality profile and the production of review type publications, both applied to a country's publications in the top journals Nature and Science. The milestones are determined for two distinct groups of emerging market economies: the BRIC countries, which outperformed the relative growth expected at their identification in 2001, and the N-11 or Next Eleven countries, identified in 2005 as potential candidates for a BRIC-like evolution. Results show how these two groups at different economic levels can be clearly distinguished based on the research milestones, indicating a potential utility as parameters in an economic context.","Rons, Nadine",ArXiv e-prints,X043b0a5e9;X15c43dda8;X1d2f6c84c;X33a849c94;X3fe487874;X49aa950a1;X55d774113;X5bf3cd2ff;X5d499e3ba;X726f44230;X7950a694d;X8ee1b41ac;X9405b22c7;X9e4ba251b;Xa24262ed1;Xb11ea01ff;Xb3414fea6;Xd52e8092d,18,Research Excellence Milestones of BRIC and N-11 Countries,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6791,2013

390,"The Center for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University advocates the use of specific normalizations for assessing research performance with reference to a world average. The Journal Citation Score (JCS) and Field Citation Score (FCS) are averaged for the research group or individual researcher under study, and then these values are used as denominators of the (mean) Citations per publication (CPP). Thus, this normalization is based on dividing two averages. This procedure only generates a legitimate indicator in the case of underlying normal distributions. Given the skewed distributions under study, one should average the observed versus expected values which are to be divided first for each publication. We show the effects of the Leiden normalization for a recent evaluation where we happened to have access to the underlying data.","Opthof, Tobias;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X12fb13aa7;X1f46b7ab6;X25db0ffdc;X2c4f74bf2;X44a72ca10;X4742380a9;X967901884;Xdad12ddce;Xff1610fdf,9,"Caveats for the journal and field normalizations in the CWTS (""Leiden"") evaluations of research performance",http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2769,2010
391,"We describe the ""Fair Dealing Button,"" a feature designed for authors who have deposited their papers in an Open Access Institutional Repository but have deposited them as ""Closed Access"" (meaning only the metadata are visible and retrievable, not the full eprint) rather than Open Access. The Button allows individual users to request and authors to provide a single eprint via semi-automated email. The purpose of the Button is to tide over research usage needs during any publisher embargo on Open Access and, more importantly, to make it possible for institutions to adopt the ""Immediate-Deposit/Optional-Access"" Mandate, without exceptions or opt-outs, instead of a mandate that allows delayed deposit or deposit waivers, depending on publisher permissions or embargoes (or no mandate at all). This is only ""Almost-Open Access,"" but in facilitating exception-free immediate-deposit mandates it will accelerate the advent of universal Open Access.","Sale, Arthur;Couture, Marc;Rodrigues, Eloy;Carr, Leslie;Harnad, Stevan",ArXiv e-prints,X0093af2dd;X0dc9c702e;X247faf1f5;X2e3a9f826;X313ed27d5;X315cb814c;X3263a49ff;X370afe1df;X3a80458c2;X3e7605b33;X4bfef9909;X584c50b14;X5d2f1264f;X5f6598883;X652d60dd0;X6b368437a;X6b870dbce;X6fb540c6a;X79239b5ed;X7e9924b9f;X8400e74ed;X99832bfbc;X9d9f9623c;Xa100eaa00;Xb63708a74;Xb8d75e5b4;Xc2712e125;Xc55e07c3a;Xd20c717fc;Xd3ada6f04;Xd54acce0b;Xdf8a080c1;Xe017a8aba;Xe54d2bc7b;Xf52d48083;Xf7bbef60c;Xf957f541d;Xfa77c9a50;Xfb297b8fd;Xfff7d23cc,40,"Open Access Mandates and the ""Fair Dealing"" Button",http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3074,2010
392,"Many discussions have enlarged the literature in Bibliometrics since the Hirsch proposal, the so called h-index. Ranking papers according to their citations, this index quantifies a researcher only by its greatest possible number of papers that are cited at least h times. A closed formula for h-index distribution that can be applied for distinct databases is not yet known. In fact, to obtain such distribution, the knowledge of citation distribution of the authors and its specificities are required. Instead of dealing with researchers randomly chosen, here we address different groups based on distinct databases. The first group is composed of physicists and biologists, with data extracted from Institute of Scientific Information (ISI). The second group is composed of computer scientists, in which data were extracted from Google-Scholar system. In this paper, we obtain a general formula for the h-index probability density function (pdf) for groups of authors by using generalized exponentials in the context of escort probability. Our analysis includes the use of several statistical methods to estimate the necessary parameters. Also an exhaustive comparison among the possible candidate distributions are used to describe the way the citations are distributed among authors. The h-index pdf should be used to classify groups of researchers from a quantitative point of view, which is meaningfully interesting to eliminate obscure qualitative methods.","da Silva, Roberto;Kalil, Fahad;de Oliveira, José Palazzo Moreira;Martinez, Alexandre Souto",Physica A Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,X2abb24e41;X4e5198f15;X87c1f4c83;Xf7ece845e,4,Universality in bibliometrics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2829,2012

Annotation, a core scholarly activity enabled by many DL solutions, exhibits a clearly unacceptable characteristic when existing models are applied to the web: due to the representations of web resources changing over time, an annotation made about a web resource today may no longer be relevant to the representation that is served from that same resource tomorrow. We assume the existence of archived versions of resources, and combine the temporal features of the emerging Open Annotation data model with the capability offered by the Memento framework that allows seamless navigation from the URI of a resource to archived versions of that resource, and arrive at a solution that provides guarantees regarding the persistence of web annotations over time.

401,"The growing focus in research policy worldwide on top scientists makes it increasingly important to define adequate supporting measures to help identify excellent scientists. Highly cited publications have since long been associated to research excellence. At the same time, the analysis of the high-end of citation distributions still is a challenging topic in evaluative bibliometrics. Evaluations typically require indicators that generate sufficiently stable results when applied to recent publication records of limited size. Highly cited publications have been identified using two techniques in particular: pre-set percentiles, and the parameter free Characteristic Scores and Scales (CSS) (Gl\""anzel & Schubert, 1988). The stability required in assessments of relatively small publication records, concerns size as well as content of groups of highly cited publications. Influencing factors include domain delineation and citation window length. Stability in size is evident for the pre-set percentiles, and has been demonstrated for the CSS-methodology beyond an initial citation period of about three years (Gl\""anzel, 2007). Stability in content is less straightforward, considering for instance that more highly cited publications can have a later citation peak, as observed by Abt (1981) for astronomical papers. This paper investigates the stability in content of groups of highly cited publications, i.e. the extent to which individual publications enter and leave the group as the citation window is enlarged.","Rons, Nadine",ArXiv e-prints,X667fa455b;X6b5393307;Xbc7245404;Xdcf416fae,4,Groups of Highly Cited Publications: Stability in Content with Citation Window Length,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6797,2013

405,"Over the past decades, the competition for academic resources has gradually intensified, and worsened with the current financial crisis. To optimize the resource allocation, individualized assessment of research results is being actively studied but the current indices, such as the number of papers, the number of citations, the h-factor and its variants have limitations, especially their inability of determining co-authors' credit shares fairly. Here we establish an axiomatic system and quantify co-authors' relative contributions. Our methodology avoids subjective assignment of co-authors' credits using the inflated, fractional or harmonic methods, and provides a quantitative tool for scientific management such as funding and tenure decisions.","Wang, Ge;Yang, Jiansheng",ArXiv e-prints,X013519cb8;X072dcc2e9;X11729f4c7;X17ed31b76;X182ddbc6d;X1975a3d40;X1a11ad98e;X1d0b12d9b;X25eb593a5;X2e1cb4167;X2fcf5a970;X30e16bb00;X32664eb28;X353fbd049;X3da027970;X3dbe96d79;X42034fc29;X42d6e1bb1;X47d7b7a5b;X52b073048;X59282eea5;X5c3d75ad6;X5d684e484;X5f3b2774f;X604007619;X61033ffb2;X633734a8d;X68631af88;X6c5c3ca1a;X72642024a;X73fb1672f;X741ea73b6;X7626c81a7;X7a62fa141;X7cd2279ed;X8303e8cfe;X85eb2257d;X880c7a2d1;X89f6d657f;X8e3c469c0;X9087ecf87;X9a2a01344;Xa244b1087;Xa27d83b74;Xa83f2d250;Xaa36cb86f;Xaa4b721f0;Xaa8edc044;Xb611cacda;Xb80821ae0;Xb8bb808eb;Xbedc918ad;Xc4e31ff3f;Xcb815d8f5;Xcce0e586b;Xcd149144b;Xcd55b247e;Xd307304c8;Xd716bd96d;Xdb6db4ba1;Xe16363372;Xea90606d9;Xf0b0c5d2d;Xf3fdd5b86;Xf80109e40;Xf86762fe8;Xfa1d8c2db;Xfb6ad6cd2;Xfc54dc477,69,Axiomatic Quantification of Co-authors' Relative Contributions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3362,2010
406,"A citation-based indicator for interdisciplinarity has been missing hitherto among the set of available journal indicators. In this study, we investigate network indicators (betweenness centrality), journal indicators (Shannon entropy, the Gini coefficient), and more recently proposed Rao-Stirling measures for ""interdisciplinarity."" The latter index combines the statistics of both citation distributions of journals (vector-based) and distances in citation networks among journals (matrix-based). The effects of various normalizations are specified and measured using the matrix of 8,207 journals contained in the Journal Citation Reports of the (Social) Science Citation Index 2008. Betweenness centrality in symmetrical (1-mode) cosine-normalized networks provides an indicator outperforming betweenness in the asymmetrical (2-mode) citation network. Among the vector-based indicators, Shannon entropy performs better than the Gini coefficient, but is sensitive to size. Science and Nature, for example, are indicated at the top of the list. The new diversity measure provides reasonable results when (1 - cosine) is assumed as a measure for the distance, but results using Euclidean distances were difficult to interpret.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Rafols, Ismael",ArXiv e-prints,X00645a85c;X036f6f00c;X0b75f294c;X0c3ca1f1e;X29a13b225;X377e32eea;X3fd535496;X44a0c756d;X550899aa6;X55ff57b1c;X5928625db;X5fb15bc16;X637161292;X66ef8832e;X69170f31c;X6c0f3fa78;X6c96edd25;X6ebf5a13d;X7188a8017;X7c93eddb5;X7ecf6ff68;X7f685e28f;X82098e4ca;X891b25994;X995412727;Xa1b994b71;Xa23be7b19;Xa3b9eeae5;Xb01c5f716;Xb6b822cc9;Xb946b94b0;Xc660779f0;Xcfcc0bb92;Xdd7cccfc5;Xe01997e75;Xf31c4f8a5,36,"Indicators of the Interdisciplinarity of Journals: Diversity, Centrality, and Citations",http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3613,2010

But, on the Web representations of prior states of a resource are also available, for example, as resource versions in Content Management Systems or archival resources in Web Archives such as the Internet Archive. This paper introduces a resource versioning mechanism that is fully based on HTTP and uses datetime as a global version indicator. The approach allows ""follow your nose"" style navigation both from the current time-generic resource to associated time-specific version resources as well as among version resources. The proposed versioning mechanism is congruent with the Architecture of the World Wide Web, and is based on the Memento framework that extends HTTP with transparent content negotiation in the datetime dimension. The paper shows how the versioning approach applies to Linked Data, and by means of a demonstrator built for DBpedia, it also illustrates how it can be used to conduct a time-series analysis across versions of Linked Data descriptions.","Van de Sompel, Herbert;Sanderson, Robert;Nelson, Michael L.;Balakireva, Lyudmila L.;Shankar, Harihar;Ainsworth, Scott",ArXiv e-prints,X06390dd30;X14430fd3c;X18285cdb8;X1b42f4dc6;X1e9fe208b;X500859aab;X53c6b3df1;X563d992d9;X5f8aa5496;X710b1347a;X7284324ce;X743a69a10;X87f9dd91c;Xb316aecc4;Xbb24942d7;Xbb8b69bc3;Xbe39e2eee;Xc76d0b86d;Xd2529b5df;Xd78e7f7c4;Xdc24be527;Xe483f1beb;Xe917ac999;Xeae977725;Xff4f16b69,25,An HTTP-Based Versioning Mechanism for Linked Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3661,2010
408,"After two decades of repository development, some conclusions may be drawn as to which type of repository and what kind of service best supports digital scholarly communication, and thus the production of new knowledge. Four types of publication repository may be distinguished, namely the subject-based repository, research repository, national repository system and institutional repository. Two important shifts in the role of repositories may be noted. With regard to content, a well-defined and high quality corpus is essential. This implies that repository services are likely to be most successful when constructed with the user and reader uppermost in mind. With regard to service, high value to specific scholarly communities is essential. This implies that repositories are likely to be most useful to scholars when they offer dedicated services supporting the production of new knowledge. Along these lines, challenges and barriers to repository development may be identified in three key dimensions: a) identification and deposit of content; b) access and use of services; and c) preservation of content and sustainability of service. An indicative comparison of challenges and barriers in some major world regions such as Europe, North America and East Asia plus Australia is offered in conclusion.","Armbruster, Chris;Romary, Laurent",ArXiv e-prints,5547fbc5a4;X00b30ca16;X024ef0800;X02f309050;X0dbbb0972;X0eebb4128;X1064cbf87;X139b5b827;X13b945f83;X19d00a0d0;X1b088cb5a;X1d18e9c76;X2254cf51a;X23fe67d34;X256791745;X267288b22;X2a251712a;X2ba29801e;X2bf093d81;X2c0247c54;X2c73d9c2a;X2d7308862;X2dbb64d50;X2ec253159;X30f0776f7;X315447c4f;X332beb34e;X38cbf3e56;X3e8601395;X420a00a7a;X43fb9b92c;X45a78d1f3;X4cec42210;X4faaca042;X555141ebc;X557910e7e;X59591a6aa;X5bad58c9c;X5dcd62878;X5f1fa4511;X5fcf0fc31;X6081838e7;X6113dfe22;X61eadaf35;X62af9fcb4;X68e415efe;X6931c756f;X6ca9d935c;X6d84ea417;X6d93f58b6;X6e577e4d2;X6f4d373a8;X70b2cbd66;X733100602;X74f8cdb2d;X7a2e4f35a;X7a77c45bf;X7c06971ab;X7c54a518c;X7eff6da17;X81bca8eeb;X8323ef3d6;X84e490bb6;X86b14afe9;X86f503901;X894e27e42;X9099e7661;X975b2ac2d;X998e2ac96;X99e9bbaa7;X9a145178e;X9a683ea0a;X9d02e0221;X9f0c00476;Xa3251349d;Xa39b0c1e1;Xa5d9c7d4f;Xa75368ebe;Xa9bdb9b25;Xa9c2e6d16;Xaa1ec6171;Xaba9be7ec;Xaccf92731;Xaf19655ee;Xb1f0bbfab;Xb21fce3ca;Xb2644b7bc;Xb30f72131;Xb31fbb5ff;Xb34c4cf6b;Xb3a51425d;Xb4707845e;Xb681d9cc9;Xb8d75e5b4;Xb92e17b5f;Xba4fc897a;Xbfe004268;Xc1233f9b3;Xc18d44358;Xc3bacaad4;Xc3e01c946;Xc522cb9a6;Xc54ba6dd1;Xc6b0c586e;Xc77649426;Xc9e07b57b;Xca391df6d;Xca40d6beb;Xcb57e3cb6;Xcbc86b303;Xd18f5a2f3;Xd2b1d48d5;Xd48ad72be;Xd4f84e7b8;Xd517b9f1c;Xd8e572488;Xd961531e9;Xdd12dd274;Xdf7c22451;Xdfbbe67a1;Xe3ec2054a;Xe57dfca18;Xebff10ac9;Xed0a9ed1f;Xee81dabd9;Xf1b622239;Xf2c79e29c;Xf3593843f;Xf52b1b196;Xf5f10087f;Xf604b36da;Xf7924eae6,132,"Comparing Repository Types - Challenges and barriers for subject-based repositories, research repositories, national repository systems and institutional repositories in serving scholarly communication",http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4187,2010
409,"The United States Code (Code) is a document containing over 22 million words that represents a large and important source of Federal statutory law. Scholars and policy advocates often discuss the direction and magnitude of changes in various aspects of the Code. However, few have mathematically formalized the notions behind these discussions or directly measured the resulting representations. This paper addresses the current state of the literature in two ways. First, we formalize a representation of the United States Code as the union of a hierarchical network and a citation network over vertices containing the language of the Code. This representation reflects the fact that the Code is a hierarchically organized document containing language and explicit citations between provisions. Second, we use this formalization to measure aspects of the Code as codified in October 2008, November 2009, and March 2010. These measurements allow for a characterization of the actual changes in the Code over time. Our findings indicate that in the recent past, the Code has grown in its amount of structure, interdependence, and language.","Bommarito, Michael J.;Katz, Daniel M.",Physica A Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,X0ee1ca7e9;X10cfa58d7;X2c80768c8;X4ea4468b2;X6b96b9dc8;X6c28ec7e9;X74c5ab7c1;X933326c2f;X9588e868c;Xd53b71fbb;Xea505af60;Xf5bcc11fb;Xfd8d948af,13,A mathematical approach to the study of the United States Code,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4146,2010

413,"Is there a difference in citation rates between articles that were published with links to data and articles that were not? Besides being interesting from a purely academic point of view, this question is also highly relevant for the process of furthering science. Data sharing not only helps the process of verification of claims, but also the discovery of new findings in archival data. However, linking to data still is a far cry away from being a “practice”, especially where it comes to authors providing these links during the writing and submission process. You need to have both a willingness and a publication mechanism in order to create such a practice. Showing that articles with links to data get higher citation rates might increase the willingness of scientists to take the extra steps of linking data sources to their publications. In this presentation we will show this is indeed the case: articles with links to data result in higher citation rates than articles without such links.","Henneken, E.

414,"Field normalized citation rates are well-established indicators for research performance from the broadest aggregation levels such as countries, down to institutes and research teams. When applied to still more specialized publication sets at the level of individual scientists, also a more accurate delimitation is required of the reference domain that provides the expectations to which a performance is compared. This necessity for sharper accuracy challenges standard methodology based on predefined subject categories. This paper proposes a way to define a reference domain that is more strongly delimited than in standard methodology, by building it up out of cells of the partition created by the pre-defined subject categories and their intersections. This partition approach can be applied to different existing field normalization variants. The resulting reference domain lies between those generated by standard field normalization and journal normalization. Examples based on fictive and real publication records illustrate how the potential impact on results can exceed or be smaller than the effect of other currently debated normalization variants, depending on the case studied. The proposed Partition-based Field Normalization is expected to offer advantages in particular at the level of individual scientists and other very specific publication records, such as publication output from interdisciplinary research.","Rons, Nadine",ArXiv e-prints,X4401b1f98;Xbd54bdadc;Xc42c9a3f8;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xeef68815a,5,Partition-based Field Normalization: An approach to highly specialized publication records,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6804,2013

The other mechanism is applied in the new crown indicator that our institute is planning to adopt. We find that at high aggregation levels, such as at the level of large research institutions or at the level of countries, the differences between the two mechanisms are very small. At lower aggregation levels, such as at the level of research groups or at the level of journals, the differences between the two mechanisms are somewhat larger. We pay special attention to the way in which recent publications are handled.

418,"Impact factors (and similar measures such as the Scimago Journal Rankings) suffer from two problems: (i) citation behavior varies among fields of science and therefore leads to systematic differences, and (ii) there are no statistics to inform us whether differences are significant. The recently introduced SNIP indicator of Scopus tries to remedy the first of these two problems, but a number of normalization decisions are involved which makes it impossible to test for significance. Using fractional counting of citations-based on the assumption that impact is proportionate to the number of references in the citing documents-citations can be contextualized at the paper level and aggregated impacts of sets can be tested for their significance. It can be shown that the weighted impact of Annals of Mathematics (0.247) is not so much lower than that of Molecular Cell (0.386) despite a five-fold difference between their impact factors (2.793 and 13.156, respectively).","Leydesdorff, Loet;Opthof, Tobias",ArXiv e-prints,X01703e6d7;X034f7ce17;X058c5a4cf;X0677525d9;X0728fa923;X0740421ed;X07565f430;X088dda128;X08c80f9c3;X08f05daa4;X097581d21;X0c7577167;X0c9ea9ba2;X0d56e042e;X0da417752;X0dbbb0972;X0df473f57;X112b4a743;X11c8f5cf5;X11f065e8e;X13a9a7698;X149cd5af5;X14cce13f5;X18d1c7fea;X1c0a7f854;X1d0721002;X1e49b5deb;X1fd87532c;X223084259;X2341782f9;X23cd74ff1;X23f171105;X23fe67d34;X2471cc823;X2530a463e;X25dd6b349;X271fc5b49;X274120195;X2a865a1c4;X2ca7c9a93;X2ce12da9b;X2f65f82b1;X32b25e024;X335422000;X33ce98bfe;X33d69cee1;X3475a0dbd;X34a3c65b3;X34e880c0b;X39ec031d4;X3a9b295d2;X3bae89cd8;X3c633f80b;X3d6be053b;X3e2ce7cda;X3f75e1b7c;X3f82c45ef;X400f09be7;X4060aba76;X41b7e96b5;X420793ae4;X438caae1a;X442dfc6fc;X44443b586;X462c2a137;X475d756d6;X4844b6cc7;X4c81c403b;X4e75ccdeb;X4f8bb6a38;X507137775;X50b3d9021;X52be28ef9;X5362b9de5;X539f33979;X5548c487a;X560695bb3;X5826ddc56;X5a04023e5;X5a8d2d029;X5bae71415;X5cc11f5da;X5e8303407;X5ef17eba1;X655cb0d40;X66e58e017;X6816f91d0;X6a2fa9087;X6d68f4c66;X6e3a435fc;X72da1661b;X739ad0926;X750734641;X798f3c6dc;X7ad79e4c0;X7c7ea0640;X7da29c33e;X7fc7be2d4;X81d213ad2;X82c18399a;X84bc81046;X85521c374;X864d2392e;X8742fb252;X8a6cd816a;X8c03a86ed;X8c1b9d20e;X8ca8556a0;X8d0372887;X8d82606c6;X8e55f6e3e;X8f0f859d8;X90486002a;X912af6ac5;X91521d55b;X923ff6848;X9250a93c0;X9341532a1;X937a3501e;X94581807e;X945d5fcbd;X95d7f4d1d;X9924231bf;X99aeb508d;X9b994c660;X9bc2e7659;Xa08e6f1b6;Xa2b59824b;Xa2e7834e4;Xa37748b0d;Xa5518cfd4;Xa6a473601;Xa8dada577;Xa91dafff9;Xaab91daf8;Xac814921f;Xaf14b8ab6;Xb34c4cf6b;Xb54be2030;Xb59cdb2ab;Xb6e3352ac;Xb954cc2aa;Xbca110c73;Xbd3e78ac4;Xbed67ef05;Xbfe0cb0a4;Xc003275e5;Xc053748f8;Xc27819b29;Xc27f81ac2;Xc3591f951;Xc5b3490a5;Xc5d73e1d0;Xc79d5bdbc;Xc7bd90912;Xc87c100b1;Xcb0c57e9f;Xcc0735c0a;Xce52625bf;Xcf678eb48;Xd26314dda;Xd2ccfdb00;Xd5f512827;Xd66728cf5;Xd71b84723;Xd9ae7b45a;Xd9eca5d6e;Xdb96b25a4;Xdb9aa61c5;Xdb9f0350e;Xdcdced2db;Xde4a450b6;Xe037a623b;Xe1c2409a6;Xe4b3cdab5;Xe5af3d130;Xe5b96315a;Xe9077570c;Xea4c5f14a;Xead209a8a;Xec15656ea;Xed1179bfc;Xeef3fc61b;Xf22681dfb;Xf2664e5eb;Xf2683e6f2;Xf313e211b;Xf39798318;Xf39dcdc4f;Xf8dd19661;Xf90dfb040;Xf93acb7c4;Xf996f4ca2;Xf9a17e9a8;Xf9bef675d;Xfbf8513b2;Xfc813dae1;Xfd4a022c8;Xfef7ab2b2;Xff9dc9c32,200,Scopus's Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP) versus a Journal Impact Factor based on Fractional Counting of Citations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.3580,2010
419,"The question of citation behavior has always intrigued scientists from various disciplines. While general citation patterns have been widely studied in the literature we develop the notion of citation projection graphs by investigating the citations among the publications that a given paper cites. We investigate how patterns of citations vary between various scientific disciplines and how such patterns reflect the scientific impact of the paper. We find that idiosyncratic citation patterns are characteristic for low impact papers; while narrow, discipline-focused citation patterns are common for medium impact papers. Our results show that crossing-community, or bridging citation patters are high risk and high reward since such patterns are characteristic for both low and high impact papers. Last, we observe that recently citation networks are trending toward more bridging and interdisciplinary forms.","Shi, Xiaolin;Leskovec, Jure;McFarland, Daniel A.",ArXiv e-prints,X15106d615;X1a7e7420b;X34ba145b9;X65f757489;Xba6d3fcff;Xc6efb45b9;Xc8748143b;Xe02abb272;Xec8e9f5ce;Xfcddca38b,10,Citing for High Impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.3351,2010

421,"We investigate the use of autonomically created small-world graphs as a framework for the long term storage of digital objects on the Web in a potentially hostile environment. We attack the classic Erdos - Renyi random, Barab'asi and Albert power law, Watts - Strogatz small world and our Unsupervised Small-World (USW) graphs using different attacker strategies and report their respective robustness. Using different attacker profiles, we construct a game where the attacker is allowed to use a strategy of his choice to remove a percentage of each graph's elements. The graph is then allowed to repair some portion of its self. We report on the number of alternating attack and repair turns until either the graph is disconnected, or the game exceeds the number of permitted turns. Based on our analysis, an attack strategy that focuses on removing the vertices with the highest betweenness value is most advantageous to the attacker. Power law graphs can become disconnected with the removal of a single edge; random graphs with the removal of as few as 1% of their vertices, small-world graphs with the removal of 14% vertices, and USW with the removal of 17% vertices. Watts - Strogatz small-world graphs are more robust and resilient than random or power law graphs. USW graphs are more robust and resilient than small world graphs. A graph of USW connected web objects (WOs) filled with data could outlive the individuals and institutions that created the data in an environment where WOs are lost due to random failures or directed attacks.","Cartledge, Charles L.;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X0bcacb630;X3ff385e1d;X563d992d9;X745451a61;X8850fca4a;X9851ab4e6;Xa3d1b3e1b;Xb1d827912;Xe1e5aca1c;Xe4e421cbf,10,Analysis of Graphs for Digital Preservation Suitability,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4296,2010

The census is built collaboratively, collected in pages with a given semantic and presenting observations of the widespread notations being used in existing materials by a graphical extract.

430,"After two decades of repository development, some conclusions may be drawn as to which type of repository and what kind of service best supports digital scholarly communication, and thus the production of new knowledge. Four types of publication repository may be distinguished, namely the subject-based repository, research repository, national repository system and institutional repository. Two important shifts in the role of repositories may be noted. With regard to content, a well-defined and high quality corpus is essential. This implies that repository services are likely to be most successful when constructed with the user and reader uppermost in mind. With regard to service, high value to specific scholarly communities is essential. This implies that repositories are likely to be most useful to scholars when they offer dedicated services supporting the production of new knowledge. Along these lines, challenges and barriers to repository development may be identified in three key dimensions: a) identification and deposit of content; b) access and use of services; and c) preservation of content and sustainability of service.

433,"The universe of potentially interesting, searchable literature is expanding continuously. Besides the normal expansion, there is an additional influx of literature because of interdisciplinary boundaries becoming more and more diffuse. Hence, the need for accurate, efficient and intelligent search tools is bigger than ever. Even with a sophisticated search engine, looking for information can still result in overwhelming results. An overload of information has the intrinsic danger of scaring visitors away, and any organization, for-profit or not-for-profit, in the business of providing scholarly information wants to capture and keep the attention of its target audience. Publishers and search engine engineers alike will benefit from a service that is able to provide visitors with recommendations that closely meet their interests. Providing visitors with special deals, new options and highlights may be interesting to a certain degree, but what makes more sense (especially from a commercial point of view) than to let visitors do most of the work by the mere action of making choices? Hiring psychics is not an option, so a technological solution is needed to recommend items that a visitor is likely to be looking for. In this presentation we will introduce such a solution and argue that it is practically feasible to incorporate this approach into a useful addition to any information retrieval system with enough usage.","Henneken, Edwin A.;Kurtz, Michael J.;Accomazzi, Alberto;Grant, Carolyn;Thompson, Donna;Bohlen, Elizabeth;Di Milia, Giovanni;Luker, Jay;Murray, Stephen S.",Future Professional Communication in Astronomy II,4201071e72;X1d3c93d39;X3954f5892;X3eb53a67f;X499005669;X70ebaa43f;X876a1e455;Xbc915ef9d;Xc1f6bbbf5;Xdec7c7873;Xff9c3bc5d,11,Finding Your Literature Match - A Recommender System,http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2308,2011
434,"To improve on existing models of interaction with a proof assistant (PA), in particular for storage and replay of proofs, we in- troduce three related concepts, those of: a proof movie, consisting of frames which record both user input and the corresponding PA response; a camera, which films a user's interactive session with a PA as a movie; and a proviola, which replays a movie frame-by-frame to a third party. In this paper we describe the movie data structure and we discuss a proto- type implementation of the camera and proviola based on the ProofWeb system. ProofWeb uncouples the interaction with a PA via a web- interface (the client) from the actual PA that resides on the server. Our camera films a movie by ""listening"" to the ProofWeb communication. The first reason for developing movies is to uncouple the reviewing of a formal proof from the PA used to develop it: the movie concept enables users to discuss small code fragments without the need to install the PA or to load a whole library into it. Other advantages include the possibility to develop a separate com- mentary track to discuss or explain the PA interaction. We assert that a combined camera+proviola provides a generic layer between a client (user) and a server (PA). Finally we claim that movies are the right type of data to be stored in an encyclopedia of formalized mathematics, based on our experience in filming the Coq standard library.","Tankink, Carst;Geuvers, Herman;McKinna, James;Wiedijk, Freek",ArXiv e-prints,X01e437165;X1b3fba68f;X31a7a141a,3,Proviola: A Tool for Proof Re-animation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2672,2010

436,"Users of Institutional Repositories and Digital Libraries are known by their needs for very specific information about one or more subjects. To characterize users profiles and offer them new documents and resources is one of the main challenges of today's libraries. In this paper, a Selective Dissemination of Information service is described, which proposes an Ontology-based Context Aware system for identifying user's context (research subjects, work team, areas of interest). This system enables librarians to broaden users profiles beyond the information that users have introduced by hand (such as institution, age and language). The system requires a context retrieval layer to capture user information and behavior, and an inference engine to support context inference from many information sources (selected documents and users' queries).","De Giusti, Marisa R.;Villarreal, Gonzalo L.;Vosou, Agustín;Martínez, Juan P.",ArXiv e-prints,X0c45e4d88;X0e7b1a43f;X26b003f37;X27c66b668;X29dc52530;X3d0cff914;X3f12ea6e5;X4aca07190;X71382232c;X868e8bbff;X8dd595d9f;Xa0809c730;Xc027c06e4;Xc4ca9dacf;Xd27d91dae;Xd2aee4a34;Xefd336c57;Xf33e27e7d;Xfd9f5129b,19,An Ontology-based Context Aware System for Selective Dissemination of Information in a Digital Library,http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4008,2010
437,"The number of citations received by authors in scientific journals has become a major parameter to assess individual researchers and the journals themselves through the impact factor. A fair assessment therefore requires that the criteria for selecting references in a given manuscript should be unbiased with respect to the authors or the journals cited. In this paper, we advocate that authors should follow two mandatory principles to select papers (later reflected in the list of references) while studying the literature for a given research: i) consider similarity of content with the topics investigated, lest very related work should be reproduced or ignored; ii) perform a systematic search over the network of citations including seminal or very related papers. We use formalisms of complex networks for two datasets of papers from the arXiv repository to show that neither of these two criteria is fulfilled in practice.","Amancio, D. R.;Nunes, M. G.

440,"In this paper peer review reliability is investigated based on peer ratings of research teams at two Belgian universities. It is found that outcomes can be substantially influenced by the different ways in which experts attribute ratings. To increase reliability of peer ratings, procedures creating a uniform reference level should be envisaged. One should at least check for signs of low reliability, which can be obtained from an analysis of the outcomes of the peer evaluation itself. The peer review results are compared to outcomes from a citation analysis of publications by the same teams, in subject fields well covered by citation indexes. It is illustrated how, besides reliability, comparability of results depends on the nature of the indicators, on the subject area and on the intrinsic characteristics of the methods. The results further confirm what is currently considered as good practice: the presentation of results for not one but for a series of indicators.","Rons, Nadine;Spruyt, Eric",ArXiv e-prints,X683f47049;X8ba5a79fa,2,Reliability and Comparability of Peer Review Results,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7031,2013

The hidden assumption behind such approaches, a correlation between the graph structure of the Web and its content, has not been tested explicitly despite increasing research on Web topology\cite{Lawrence98,Albert99,Adamic99,Butler00}. Here I formalize and quantitatively validate two conjectures drawing connections from link information to lexical and semantic Web content. The clink-content conjecture states that a page is similar to the pages that link to it, i.e., one can infer the lexical content of a page by looking at the pages that link to it. I also show that lexical inferences based on link cues are quite heterogeneous across Web communities. The link-cluster conjecture states that pages about the same topic are clustered together, i.e., one can infer the meaning of a page by looking at its neighbours. These results explain the success of the newest search technologies and open the way for more dynamic and scalable methods to locate information in a topic or user driven way.","Menczer, Filippo",ArXiv e-prints,X00e697ce3;X258086b28;X471cd1b1e;X68395619c;X97da6a7fd;Xb6b822cc9,6,Links tell us about lexical and semantic Web content,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0108004,2001

Using an idea originally developed in the context of the Dutch science shops, the university staff was questionnaired about keywords and areas of expertise with the specific purpose of disclosing this information to audiences other than academic colleagues. The results were brought online in a thesaurus-like structure that enables users to access the university at the level of individual email address.

452,"RESTful services on the Web expose information through retrievable resource representations that represent self-describing descriptions of resources, and through the way how these resources are interlinked through the hyperlinks that can be found in those representations. This basic design of RESTful services means that for extracting the most useful information from a service, it is necessary to understand a service's representations, which means both the semantics in terms of describing a resource, and also its semantics in terms of describing its linkage with other resources. Based on the Resource Linking Language (ReLL), this paper describes a framework for how RESTful services can be described, and how these descriptions can then be used to harvest information from these services. Building on this framework, a layered model of RESTful service semantics allows to represent a service's information in RDF/OWL. Because REST is based on the linkage between resources, the same model can be used for aggregating and interlinking multiple services for extracting RDF data from sets of RESTful services.","Alarcon, Rosa;Wilde, Erik",ArXiv e-prints,X06623b585;X0c1a53eab;X0c3e95537;X16a7ad09b;X21cad5302;X25c4ba96d;X2a7028e39;X2b4a905e8;X2b71ccc4e;X2c01f625c;X2f0796df0;X3b2e32352;X44a951604;X499b2f657;X5278b9188;X554614ea8;X60af904f1;X68cb552d2;X725cf5491;X7cab73580;X9237299e8;X9b9228616;Xa111f0f1b;Xa63cc7a67;Xacf8a754f;Xbfde50d05;Xc3682fcbe;Xd1b91870b;Xde9aaa813;Xdebadc9d2;Xf505dfc8d,31,From RESTful Services to RDF: Connecting the Web and the Semantic Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2718,2010

454,"This paper investigates the role of homophily and focus constraint in shaping collaborative scientific research. First, homophily structures collaboration when scientists adhere to a norm of exclusivity in selecting similar partners at a higher rate than dissimilar ones. Two dimensions on which similarity between scientists can be assessed are their research specialties and status positions. Second, focus constraint shapes collaboration when connections among scientists depend on opportunities for social contact. Constraint comes in two forms, depending on whether it originates in institutional or geographic space. Institutional constraint refers to the tendency of scientists to select collaborators within rather than across institutional boundaries. Geographic constraint is the principle that, when collaborations span different institutions, they are more likely to involve scientists that are geographically co-located than dispersed. To study homophily and focus constraint, the paper will argue in favour of an idea of collaboration that moves beyond formal co-authorship to include also other forms of informal intellectual exchange that do not translate into the publication of joint work. A community-detection algorithm is applied to the co-authorship network of the scientists that submitted in Business and Management in the 2001 UK RAE. While results only partially support research-based homophily, they indicate that scientists use status positions for discriminating between potential partners by selecting collaborators from institutions with a rating similar to their own. Strong support is provided in favour of institutional and geographic constraints. Scientists tend to forge intra-institutional collaborations; yet, when they seek collaborators outside their own institutions, they tend to select those who are in geographic proximity.","Evans, T.

456,"This paper describes the method for ex-post peer review evaluation per research discipline used at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and summarizes the outcomes obtained from it. The method produces pertinent advice and triggers responses - at the level of the individual researcher, the research team and the university's research management - for the benefit of research quality, competitivity and visibility. Imposed reflection and contacts during and after the evaluation procedure modify the individual researcher's attitude, improve the research teams' strategies and allow for the extraction of general recommendations that are used as discipline-dependent guidelines in the university's research management. The deep insights gained in the different research disciplines and the substantial data sets on their research, support the university management in its policy decisions and in building policy instruments. Moreover, the results are used as a basis for comparison with other assessments, leading to a better understanding of the possibilities and limitations of different evaluation processes. The peer review method can be applied systematically in a pluri-annual cycle of research discipline evaluations to build up a complete overview, or it can be activated on an ad hoc basis for a particular discipline, based on demands from research teams or on strategic or policy arguments.","Rons, Nadine;De Bruyn, Arlette;Cornelis, Jan",ArXiv e-prints,X0fce770f6;X1777571ce;X1dbe78943;X2baaabf12;X2d835f8d8;Xbdeff5006;Xcadd1abef;Xccb627af8,8,Research evaluation per discipline: a peer-review method and its outcomes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7033,2013

459,"Citation numbers are extensively used for assessing the quality of scientific research. The use of raw citation counts is generally misleading, especially when applied to cross-disciplinary comparisons, since the average number of citations received is strongly dependent on the scientific discipline of reference of the paper. Measuring and eliminating biases in citation patterns is crucial for a fair use of citation numbers. Several numerical indicators have been introduced with this aim, but so far a specific statistical test for estimating the fairness of these numerical indicators has not been developed. Here we present a statistical method aimed at estimating the effectiveness of numerical indicators in the suppression of citation biases. The method is simple to implement and can be easily generalized to various scenarios. As a practical example we test, in a controlled case, the fairness of fractional citation count, which has been recently proposed as a tool for cross-discipline comparison. We show that this indicator is not able to remove biases in citation patterns and performs much worse than the rescaling of citation counts with average values.","Radicchi, Filippo;Castellano, Claudio",ArXiv e-prints,X04db9b81f;X0933aa0ed;X31ebab182;X7c94a64c0;X94e2c59ab;Xf0caed464,6,Testing the fairness of citation indicators for comparison across scientific domains: the case of fractional citation counts,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6053,2011

This is seen as a conspicuous flaw of such exercises and calls have been made to find a remedy. Here a simple, systematic solution is proposed based upon a mathematical model for the relationship between research quality and group quantity. This model manifests both the Matthew effect and a phenomenon akin to the Ringelmann effect and reveals the existence of two critical masses for each academic discipline: a lower value, below which groups are vulnerable, and an upper value beyond which the dependency of quality on quantity reduces and plateaus appear when the critical masses are large. A possible normalization procedure is then to pitch these plateaus at similar levels. We examine the consequences of this procedure at RAE for a multitude of academic disciplines, corresponding to a range of critical masses.","Kenna, Ralph;Berche, Bertrand",ArXiv e-prints,X0e603b1b6;X26153df14;X4e77f9b72;X7be612144;X7bf7ec80c;X7c48db004;X869c0f90c;X9587e51f9;Xb959dc039;Xc363c81f7;Xcd60148b5;Xdafd31791;Xdd40fed26;Xf9669f57f,14,Normalization of peer-evaluation measures of group research quality across academic disciplines,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3863,2010
464,"This paper introduces the write-once/read-many XMLtape/ARC storage approach for Digital Objects and their constituent datastreams. The approach combines two interconnected file-based storage mechanisms that are made accessible in a protocol-based manner. First, XML-based representations of multiple Digital Objects are concatenated into a single file named an XMLtape. An XMLtape is a valid XML file; its format definition is independent of the choice of the XML-based complex object format by which Digital Objects are represented. The creation of indexes for both the identifier and the creation datetime of the XML-based representation of the Digital Objects facilitates OAI-PMH-based access to Digital Objects stored in an XMLtape. Second, ARC files, as introduced by the Internet Archive, are used to contain the constituent datastreams of the Digital Objects in a concatenated manner. An index for the identifier of the datastream facilitates OpenURL-based access to an ARC file. The interconnection between XMLtapes and ARC files is provided by conveying the identifiers of ARC files associated with an XMLtape as administrative information in the XMLtape, and by including OpenURL references to constituent datastreams of a Digital Object in the XML-based representation of that Digital Object.","Liu, Xiaoming;Balakireva, Lyudmila;Hochstenbach, Patrick;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X27d39a400;X3bc3a4a12;X3e7db01c3;X65800041e;X9499cdcb8;Xa79b57aec;Xb8b8b3f7a;Xd39b24f21;Xf65dfeaec,9,File-based storage of Digital Objects and constituent datastreams: XMLtapes and Internet Archive ARC files,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0503016,2005

We found that (1) nearly half studies used one data source only.

Can these drawbacks be counteracted by counting citation weights fractionally instead of using whole numbers in the numerators? (i) Fractional citation counts are normalized in terms of the citing sources and thus would take into account differences in citation behavior among fields of science. (ii) Differences in the resulting distributions can be tested statistically for their significance at different levels of aggregation. (iii) Fractional counting can be generalized to any document set including journals or groups of journals, and thus the significance of differences among both small and large sets can be tested.

467,"Astronomers are good at sharing data, but poorer at sharing knowledge. Almost all astronomical data ends up in open archives, and access to these is being simplified by the development of the global Virtual Observatory (VO).  This is a great advance, but the fundamental problem remains that these archives contain only basic observational data, whereas all the astrophysical interpretation of that data — which source is a quasar, which a low-mass star, and which an image artefact — is contained in journal papers, with very little linkage back from the literature to the original data archives.  It is therefore currently impossible for an astronomer to pose a query like “give me all sources in this data archive that have been identified as quasars” and this limits the effective exploitation of these archives, as the user of an archive has no direct means of taking advantage of the knowledge derived by its previous users.  The AstroDAbis service aims to address this, in a prototype service enabling astronomers to record annotations and cross-identifications in the AstroDAbis service, annotating objects in other catalogues.  We have deployed two interfaces to the annotations, namely one astronomy-specific one using the TAP protocol (Dowler et al. 2011), and a second exploiting generic Linked Open Data (LOD) and RDF techniques.","Gray, N.;Mann, R.

468,"Introduction. The purpose of this work is the evaluation of responsiveness when remote users communicate with a human-readable knowledge base (KB). Responsiveness [R(s)] is considered here as a measure of service quality. Method. The preferred method is operational analysis, a variation of classical stochastic theory, which allows for the study of user-system interaction with minimal computational effort. Analysis. The analysis is based on well-known performance metrics, such as service ability, elapsed time, and throughput: from these metrics estimates of R(s) are derived analytically. Results. Critical points indicating congestion are obtained: these are limits on the number of admissible requests and the number of connected users. Also obtained is a sufficient condition for achieving flow balance between the KB host and the request-relaying servers. Conclusions. When R(s) is within normal limits, users should appreciate the benefits from using the services offered by their KB host. When bottlenecks are formed, R(s) declines, and the whole communication system heads for saturation. Flow balancing procedures are necessary for the elimination of bottlenecks, which leads to a better resource management.","Pentzaropoulos, G.

469,"A quantitative modification to keep the number of published papers invariant under multiple authorship is suggested. In those cases, fractional allocations are attributed to each co-author with a summation equal to one. These allocations are tailored on the basis of each author contribution. It is denoted ""Tailor Based Allocations (TBA)"" for multiple authorship. Several protocols to TBA are suggested. The choice of a specific TBA may vary from one discipline to another. In addition, TBA is applied to the number of citations of a multiple author paper to have also this number conserved. Each author gets only a specific fraction of the total number of citations according to its fractional paper allocation. The equivalent of the h-index obtained by using TBA is denoted the gh-index. It yields values which differ drastically from those given by the h-index. The gh-index departs also from the `h-index recently proposed by Hirsh to account for multiple authorship. Contrary to the h-index, the gh-index is a function of the total number of citations of each paper. A highly cited paper allows a better allocation for all co-authors while a less cited paper contributes essentially to one or two of the co-authors. The scheme produces a substantial redistribution of the ranking of scientists in terms of quantitative records. A few illustrations are provided.","Galam, Serge",ArXiv e-prints,X275244706;X4390dead2;Xd55ac1b3b,3,Tailor Based Allocations for Multiple Authorship: a fractional $gh$-index,http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3708,2010

474,"We develop a model for the distribution of scientific citations. The model involves a dual mechanism: in the direct mechanism, the author of a new paper finds an old paper A and cites it. In the indirect mechanism, the author of a new paper finds an old paper A only via the reference list of a newer intermediary paper B, which has previously cited A. By comparison to citation databases, we find that papers having few citations are cited mainly by the direct mechanism. Papers already having many citations ('classics') are cited mainly by the indirect mechanism. The indirect mechanism gives a power-law tail. The 'tipping point' at which a paper becomes a classic is about 21 citations for papers published in the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science database in 1981, 29 for Physical Review D papers published from 1975-1994, and 39 for all publications from a list of high h-index chemists assembled in 2007.

480,"Understanding constellations in large data collections has become a common task. One obstacle a user has to overcome is the internal complexity of these repositories. For example, extracting connected data from a normalized relational database requires knowledge of the table structure which might not be available for the casual user. In this paper we present a visualization framework which presents the collection as a set of entities and relations (on the data level). Using rating functions, we divide large relation networks into small graphs which resemble ego-centered networks. These graphs are connected so the user can browse from one to another. To further assist the user, we present two views which embed information on the evolution of the relations into the graphs. Each view emphasizes another aspect of temporal development. The framework can be adapted to any repository by a flexible data interface and a graph configuration file. We present some first web-based applications including a visualization of the DBLP data set. We use the DBLP visualization to evaluate our approach.","Reitz, Florian",ArXiv e-prints,X036a26df2;X2fb25a1ed;X422ec2458;X739d823ee;X879cb3945;X9bacaaf39;Xa1d81cd33;Xb98f65f79;Xc39d928aa;Xc500db453;Xc6c873840,11,A Framework for an Ego-centered and Time-aware Visualization of Relations in Arbitrary Data Repositories,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5183,2010
481,"The problems that scientists face in creating well designed databases intersect with the concerns of data curation. Entity-relationship modeling and its variants have been the basis of most relational data modeling for decades. However, these abstractions and the relational model itself are intricate and have proved not to be very accessible among scientists with limited resources for data management. This paper explores one aspect of relational data models, the meaning of foreign key relationships. We observe that a foreign key produces a table relationship that generally references either an entity or repeating attributes. This paper proposes constructing foreign keys based on these two cases, and suggests that the method promotes intuitive data modeling and normalization.","Nassar, Nassib",ArXiv e-prints,X34d42e1ff;X4c4731037;Xec22c3d32,3,A Simple Abstraction for Data Modeling,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5233,2010

Our indices utilize a policy that assigns the weights to multiple authors of a paper. We have considered two weight assignment policies: positionally weighted and equally weighted. We propose two classes of weighted indices: weighted h-indices and weighted citation h-cuts. Further, we compare our weighted h-indices with the original h-index for a selected set of authors. As opposed to h-index, our weighted h-indices take into account the weighted contributions of individual authors in multi-authored papers, and may serve as an improvement over h-index. The other class of weighted indices that we call weighted citation h-cuts take into account the number of citations that are in excess of those required to compute the index, and may serve as a supplement to h-index or its variants.","Abbas, Ash Mohammad",ArXiv e-prints,X0876dac14;X7d6af118c;Xafc83bd12;Xd2b87de66;Xd84d825b7,5,Weighted Indices for Evaluating the Quality of Research with Multiple Authorship,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1904,2010

This paper uses methods from social network analysis and bibliometrics to re-examine the structures of CSCW a decade after its last systematic analysis. Using data from the ACM Digital Library, we analyze changes in structures of coauthorship and citation between 1986 and 2013. Statistical models reveal significant but distinct patterns between papers and authors in how brokerage and closure in these networks affects impact as measured by citations and downloads. Specifically, impact is unduly influenced by structural position, such that ideas introduced by those in the core of the CSCW community (e.g., elite researchers) are advantaged over those introduced by peripheral participants (e.g., newcomers). This finding is examined in the context of recent changes to the CSCW conference that may have the effect of upsetting the preference for contributions from the core.","Keegan, Brian;Horn, Dan;Finholt, Thomas A.;""Jofish"" Kaye, Joseph",ArXiv e-prints,X044b17010;X0a3ae7f7f;X0e7d1f693;X0ff0d1f17;X1998833ba;X1d3c93d39;X21a92eb72;X291825025;X2a9e46d29;X2e538518d;X30cd2689b;X341cc74da;X374fd329e;X3c57b9c5b;X3ed0bbef5;X3f5c170c3;X40128c29d;X4b8b6b2f5;X531f64216;X550e203b6;X586bb004d;X5b72600c3;X5c13e6370;X63da0fc7d;X649e9bfbd;X6a125b9a3;X73aa45bac;X90bc54129;X91dee514d;X961dcc135;X9980e12f4;X9c1a2a93f;Xa1b994b71;Xb1cc0a94c;Xbcfa6332f;Xc00210152;Xc77bd691b;Xca20dbb99;Xd5a2c4ecb;Xd7a722b85;Xde50dbf05;Xe0a307436;Xea0996a44;Xeec7aca4d;Xfbc6ee59c,45,"Structure and Dynamics of Coauthorship, Citation, and Impact within CSCW",http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7172,2013

Although we now agree about the statistical normalization, the ""new crown indicator"" inherits the scientometric problems of the ""old"" one in treating subject categories of journals as a standard for normalizing differences in citation behavior among fields of science. We further note that the ""mean"" is not a proper statistics for measuring differences among skewed distributions. Without changing the acronym of ""MNCS,"" one could define the ""Median Normalized Citation Score."" This would relate the new crown indicator directly to the percentile approach that is, for example, used in the Science and Engineering Indicators of US National Science Board (2010). The median is by definition equal to the 50th percentile. The indicator can thus easily be extended with the 1% (= 99th percentile) most highly-cited papers (Bornmann et al., in press).

493,"We continue investigation of the effect of position in announcements of newly received articles, a single day artifact, with citations received over the course of ensuing years. Earlier work [arXiv:0907.4740, arXiv:0805.0307] focused on the ""visibility"" effect for positions near the beginnings of announcements, and on the ""self-promotion"" effect associated to authors intentionally aiming for these positions, with both found correlated to a later enhanced citation rate. Here we consider a ""reverse-visibility"" effect for positions near the ends of announcements, and on a ""procrastination"" effect associated to submissions made within the 20 minute period just before the daily deadline. For two large subcommunities of theoretical high energy physics, we find a clear ""reverse-visibility"" effect, in which articles near the ends of the lists receive a boost in both short-term readership and long-term citations, almost comparable in size to the ""visibility"" effect documented earlier. For one of those subcommunities, we find an additional ""procrastination"" effect, in which last position articles submitted shortly before the deadline have an even higher citation rate than those that land more accidentally in that position. We consider and eliminate geographic effects as responsible for the above, and speculate on other possible causes, including ""oblivious"" and ""nightowl"" effects.","Haque, Asif-ul;Ginsparg, Paul",ArXiv e-prints,45aef5ca60;52678fb644;5458efd927;551410b7a3;5547fa5e9d;X06edb8fd5;X0ef2d004f;X153d92d46;X17e07788e;X2278e4cff;X31a8d53f4;X48da3e807;X4e0d803d9;X54dbf7d51;X60d197238;X69ce7c311;X81d0e66a6;X877d4473c;X8cbaca389;X992d74f47;X9a568f7d8;X9e96dcc18;Xac75f43ab;Xd756260e9;Xdfc50841a;Xe92df1004;Xf33bc97dd,27,Last but not Least: Additional Positional Effects on Citation and Readership in arXiv,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2757,2010

We represent collaboration in academic papers of computer science in terms of differently grained networks, including those sub-networks that emerge from conference and journal co-authorship only. We take advantage of the network science paraphernalia to take a picture of computer science collaboration including all papers published in the field since 1936. We investigate typical bibliometric properties like scientific productivity of authors and collaboration level in papers, as well as large-scale network properties like reachability and average separation distance among scholars, distribution of the number of scholar collaborators, network resilience and dependence on star collaborators, network clustering, and network assortativity by number of collaborators.","Franceschet, Massimo",ArXiv e-prints,X061ebdd7d;X086845f92;X0c3ca1f1e;X170da4f16;X1c0293d41;X26185f70b;X2e408fc45;X3c68fed33;X3dc7fd08c;X5f3d53072;X6374b8178;X657f3a1a7;X6a28cd31d;X6c1706d6a;X6f12b56c5;X89900e64f;X8d3cbaf72;X954efcbe9;Xc0ef26c3e;Xe8904758e;Xecbbaa275,21,Collaboration in computer science: a network science approach.

496,"Before we can get the whole potential of employing computers in the process of managing mathematical `knowledge', we have to convert informal knowledge into machine-oriented representations. How exactly to support this process so that it becomes as effortless as possible is one of the main unsolved problems of Mathematical Knowledge Management. Two independent projects in formalization of mathematical content showed that many of the time consuming tasks could be significantly reduced if adequate tool support were available. It was also established that similar tasks are typical for object oriented languages and that they are to a large extent solved by Integrated Development Environments (IDE). This thesis starts by analyzing the opportunities where formalization process can benefit from software support. A list of research questions is compiled along with a set of software requirements which are then used for developing a new IDE for the semantic \TeX{} (\stex{}) format. The result of the current research is that, indeed, IDEs can be very useful in the process of formalization and presents a set of best practices for implementing such IDEs.","Jucovschi, Constantin",ArXiv e-prints,,0,Editing Knowledge in Large Mathematical Corpora.

497,"With the increasing technical sophistication of both information consumers and providers, there is increasing demand for more meaningful experiences of digital information. We present a framework that separates digital object experience, or rendering, from digital object storage and manipulation, so the rendering can be tailored to particular communities of users. Our framework also accommodates extensible digital object behaviors and interoperability. The two key components of our approach are 1) exposing structural metadata associated with digital objects -- metadata about the labeled access points within a digital object and 2) information intermediaries called context brokers that match structural characteristics of digital objects with mechanisms that produce behaviors. These context brokers allow for localized rendering of digital information stored externally.","Dushay, Naomi",ArXiv e-prints,X1746013c7;X1e0c1f328;X2130cc650;X52e7c1074;X71d7e0c84;X76eb093f2;X788ae16a0;X7b39520fb;X831a9da15;X995ff3dca;Xb038df4e6;Xb4f86f7c0;Xf7b744116,13,Using Structural Metadata to Localize Experience of Digital Content,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0112017,2001

We also argue that obtaining the exponent from logarithmically binned data using a simple least square method is in some cases warranted in addition to methods such as the maximum likelihood. We also show why often used cumulative distributions can make it difficult to distinguish noise from genuine features, and make it difficult to obtain an accurate power-law exponent of the underlying distribution.

We have today very efficient and reliable methods to encode, store and retrieve data in a storage medium that is fault tolerant against many types of failures.

We use the publication records (in the Science Citation Index) of two emerging technologies to study the mechanisms of diffusion in the case of two innovation trajectories: small interference RNA (siRNA) and nano-crystalline solar cells (NCSC). Methods for analyzing and visualizing geographical and cognitive diffusion are specified as indicators of different dynamics. Geographical diffusion is illustrated with overlays to Google Maps; cognitive diffusion is mapped using an overlay to a map based on the ISI Subject Categories. The evolving geographical networks show both preferential attachment and small-world characteristics. The strength of preferential attachment decreases over time, while the network evolves into an oligopolistic control structure with small-world characteristics. The transition from disciplinary-oriented (""mode-1"") to transfer-oriented (""mode-2"") research is suggested as the crucial difference in explaining the different rates of diffusion between siRNA and NCSC.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Rafols, Ismael",ArXiv e-prints,X379d2fc15;X3c4d26883;X3dbc4bb54;Xa1b994b71;Xc6bdd65af;Xd3892c60d,6,The Local Emergence and Global Diffusion of Research Technologies: An Exploration of Patterns of Network Formation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3120,2010
506,"The aim of this study is to make a bibliometric comparison of the performance of research astronomers in the Netherlands Research School for Astronomy (NOVA) with astronomers elsewhere by using the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). We use various indices for bibliometric performance for a sample of NOVA astronomers to compare to samples of astronomers worldwide, and from the United States. We give much weight to normalising bibliometric measures by number of authors, and number of years since first publication. In particular we calculate the `Hirsh-index' normalized to number of authors and for first-author papers. Secondly, we consider the results of the 'Nederlands Observatorium van Wetenschap en Technologie' (NOWT; Netherlands Observatory of Science and Technology), which regularly publishes a report 'Science and Technology Indicators'. We reproduce those results using publication lists from institutions in the Netherlands, again using ADS, and examine and discuss the conclusions and indications in these reports. We find that the NOVA researchers perform much better in bibliometric measures than samples drawn from IAU or AAS membership lists. A more suitable comparison is one with the (tenured) staff of the top-15 US institutions and there the NOVA staff performs in these respects as good or almost as good as that of American top institutes. From a citation analysis through the use of ADS we conclude that the impact ratio of Dutch astronomical publications is rising which is opposite to what is reported by NOWT. This difference is most likely caused by a better separation of astronomy and physics in ADS than in World of Knowledge. ADS probably finds more citations in conference proceedings, while the inclusion of citations to articles with their pre-print identifier could also help explain the difference (especially since the citation windows in the reports are short).","Kamphuis, P.;van der Kruit, P.

In this paper, we analyze the relationships between impact factor, h-index, and g-index of a journal.

In the absence of the time window, the impact factor converges to the number of citations received per paper. This is not only justified for the impact factor, it simplifies the analysis of h-index and g-index as well because addition of a time window in the form of years complicates the computation of indices too.

508,"The GIIDA project aims to develop a digital infrastructure for the spatial information within CNR. It is foreseen to use semantic-oriented technologies to ease information modeling and connecting, according to international standards like the ISO/IEC 11179. Complex information management systems, like GIIDA, will take benefit from the use of terminological tools like thesauri that make available a reference lexicon for the indexing and retrieval of information. Within GIIDA the goal is to make available the EARTh thesaurus (Environmental Applications Reference Thesaurus), developed by the CNR-IIA-EKOLab. A web-based software, developed by the CNR-Water Research Institute (IRSA) was implemented to allow consultation and utilization of thesaurus through the web. This service is a useful tool to ensure interoperability between thesaurus and other systems of the indexing, with, the idea of cooperating to develop a comprehensive system of knowledge organization, that could be defined integrated, open, multi-functional and multilingual. Currently the system is available in multiple languages mode (Italian - English) and navigation can be done in the following ways: Alphabetical, Hierarchical and for Themes. A full search allows to find any term by searching for the whole term or a part of it and as well as allows to filter the results by themes.

This paper describes the first phase of the interoperability infrastructure including the metadata repository, search and discovery services, rights management services, and user interface portal facilities.","Lagoze, Carl;Arms, William;Gan, Stoney;Hillmann, Diane;Ingram, Christopher;Krafft, Dean;Marisa, Richard;Phipps, Jon;Saylor, John;Terrizzi, Carol;Hoehn, Walter;Millman, David;Allan, James;Guzman-Lara, Sergio;Kalt, Tom",ArXiv e-prints,X0004c1b87;X04de2ed0b;X13a4aead5;X19c016465;X1b20e6566;X1c255e5a1;X1d9673e62;X1e5681aea;X213830ffa;X2417f5239;X2a3b68f39;X2b817be1b;X31561cb72;X3bae553fa;X405980dc0;X42d8563a3;X45a7aa81d;X4d5811b20;X5be8b3c1c;X6106c105c;X6127291a5;X63dc330fa;X657c3860b;X6afccaacd;X6cba0502c;X739101af9;X739b15269;X7a6d702d5;X7c40a3f6c;X7fd29113f;X88fab1f25;X8a6ff6d33;X8c492e948;X8e3fed9bd;X937770493;X9489bb831;X96a84d6dc;X96da98a1f;X9c9e3085f;Xa5010ebb7;Xa6620b96e;Xa6ac398f1;Xafe6736b9;Xb4452b307;Xc02433290;Xc329e8d3a;Xc3682fcbe;Xc7d4766b9;Xc95d951e6;Xcb1d94dfe;Xd33e15124;Xd6b28a757;Xd7b6f24a6;Xd81d9d6df;Xda1c11569;Xdcd2a48fe;Xdfd967ceb;Xe22d514a9;Xe50b045ab;Xe69dd7b01;Xe87477473;Xed23425e6;Xed28f4739;Xf10edb98c;Xf2923c211;Xfa3458a5a;Xfd927d68f,67,Core Services in the Architecture of the National Digital Library for Science Education (NSDL),http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0201025,2002
510,"In the case of the scientometric evaluation of multi- or interdisciplinary units one risks to compare apples with oranges: each paper has to assessed in comparison to an appropriate reference set. We suggest that the set of citing papers first can be considered as the relevant representation of the field of impact. In order to normalize for differences in citation behavior among fields, citations can be fractionally counted proportionately to the length of the reference lists in the citing papers. This new method enables us to compare among units with different disciplinary affiliations at the paper level and also to assess the statistical significance of differences among sets. Twenty-seven departments of the Tsinghua University in Beijing are thus compared. Among them, the Department of Chinese Language and Linguistics is upgraded from the 19th to the second position in the ranking. The overall impact of 19 of the 27 departments is not significantly different at the 5% level when thus normalized for different citation potentials.","Zhou, Ping;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X00e338841;X06d4e3293;X0954e8445;X19c910d71;X1a31a1de6;X1eb78e234;X2081b8f0a;X251736cd4;X30cd2689b;X4390dead2;X6219ca39b;X9d8288891;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xb1ca7a511;Xb5539d1c2;Xb9c6d2680;Xbd9a763dc;Xd1c14c1fa;Xefb96a100;Xfe62b43c2,21,Fractional counting of citations in research evaluation: An option for cross- and interdisciplinary assessments,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0359,2010

512,"If we want to assess whether the paper in question has had a particularly high or low citation impact compared to other papers, the standard practice in bibliometrics is to normalize citations in respect of the subject category and publication year. A number of proposals for an improved procedure in the normalization of citation impact have been put forward in recent years. Against the background of these proposals this study describes an ideal solution for the normalization of citation impact: in a first step, the reference set for the publication in question is collated by means of a classification scheme, where every publication is associated with a single principal research field or subfield entry (e. g. via Chemical Abstracts sections) and a publication year. In a second step, percentiles of citation counts are calculated for this set and used to assign the normalized citation impact score to the publications (and also to the publication in question).","Bornmann, Lutz;Marx, Werner;Barth, Andreas",ArXiv e-prints,X2d31ce0bf;X397b1929f;X6e009aee8;X7e364337b;X96f2e38b3;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xb6011c02d;Xdfd967ceb;Xe6a7847cc;Xe6c65522d;Xf247ab6e0,12,The normalization of citation counts based on classification systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7498,2013
513,"This paper proposes an architecture and assignment management model of a conference management system that performs a precise and accurate automatic assignment of reviewers to papers. The system relies on taxonomy of keywords to describe papers and reviewers' competences. The implied hierarchical structure of the taxonomy provides important additional information - the semantic relationships between the separate keywords. It allows similarity measures to take into account not only the number of exactly matching keywords between a paper and a reviewer, but in case of non-matching ones to calculate how semantically close they are. Reviewers are allowed to bid on the papers they would like to (or not like to) review and to explicitly state conflicts of interest (CoI) with papers. An automatic CoI detection is checking for additional conflicts based on institutional affiliation, co-authorship (within the local database) and previous co-authorship in the past (within the major bibliographic indexes and digital libraries). The algorithm for automatic assignment takes into account all - selected keywords, reviewers' bids and conflicts of interest and tries to find the most accurate assignment while maintaining load balancing among reviewers.","Kalmukov, Yordan",ArXiv e-prints,X012660e10;X014820dcd;X02703a6f9;X038bb5299;X0cb878918;X0cce252e2;X0dce1c397;X0f15157f7;X107054ac2;X1104b653b;X11db9b839;X11e3430cf;X14fbd648d;X154a1b083;X15e9d6408;X1726eb6c4;X19e07e3e6;X1dfb10167;X2166ea527;X21c94454d;X220640cd1;X22468e1ad;X22b38c732;X240eaf30c;X263947aa4;X2767de40d;X281a0dc6b;X282a241a3;X28624712c;X29fb114cb;X2a794c1d2;X2b07d83e1;X2b2544bd2;X2bb9ca428;X2d0cf5cd2;X2d894c5ad;X2dbb4b9c9;X2e0e74b5b;X31429edfa;X32df5392d;X34e754443;X365edf0a4;X3781ccf2e;X383aa5191;X3ac7fb0aa;X3b69c3c52;X3cce06296;X3e15e3a8b;X3e6953752;X3ec715cf2;X3f54b29e4;X40aafe8b5;X412a6203f;X423b289bd;X42b6fa5a0;X434b900d5;X445151e0f;X44ac0759a;X464ff868e;X46db4be1a;X494a5a37f;X494bbc2b6;X4a16b5a24;X4a3d4e6ee;X4ab9c491a;X4d9de4f09;X4e057e250;X4e383fdfe;X50714d92e;X5107a9a92;X524ba7f3a;X52c2e8f6c;X535aafd10;X536f8ef4b;X54d48aeea;X558e55dde;X55fcbe950;X58f507c19;X5b0337f20;X5d9733826;X5dd8c561c;X5edab957a;X607b243d4;X60bb4d2d5;X6124b0049;X626ff8a2b;X62f0a5657;X63bf11e59;X648b0552d;X6511b4c76;X6652c94f8;X66a29e101;X69bc32766;X6a5583cfd;X6c29a4a45;X6c44d3445;X6c8fae6a0;X6df235dcb;X72d4751ed;X734bf06ab;X76d702bb2;X773e83cb8;X788f2eafa;X7afbd2fcf;X7b1a0476e;X7c21638ae;X7ccc2b231;X7f7d998fa;X803bd7485;X804325f85;X8130c579e;X813200949;X85176f980;X884959ee9;X88b3b37cd;X896cbd31a;X8a91ae942;X8ba104730;X8d39ec1d0;X8dc88e831;X8e68b9781;X8eb97af18;X9188cea03;X919c9b98c;X91fe2767a;X927291c87;X936e9066c;X952ec5bf3;X96ad738a9;X982319cca;X98e082180;X990fe743c;X9dc52febb;X9f030c9b6;Xa022889e9;Xa2eff8e1a;Xa659ea719;Xa67e3624e;Xa6b9afcb3;Xa9bb96630;Xaba9c8d56;Xadc241beb;Xadc914037;Xae24acd0d;Xaea2a4d6b;Xaf28febfc;Xafba9a146;Xb00085c72;Xb14142630;Xb2c1b64ce;Xb3c264ab9;Xb73984231;Xbad973740;Xbb23c195f;Xbb882f7d3;Xbd6506daa;Xc07a869b5;Xc2cd4bf37;Xc41dc07b0;Xc45631904;Xc4aac9104;Xc4c4d66a6;Xc54a1c219;Xc7098c46f;Xc76966a9e;Xc8d12e424;Xca016edf8;Xca20dbb99;Xca2a7ddd2;Xcc0fb10d4;Xccc8499c3;Xcd4dfa026;Xcd6dc7204;Xcfef00f56;Xd1f18efcf;Xd42db6310;Xd48e9e83d;Xd62eb54dd;Xdb4f71760;Xdf4a2b9b8;Xdf75cc10b;Xe052d6ca0;Xe086c5bba;Xe134e9e2a;Xe3f33cf8d;Xe64f838a0;Xe736acc67;Xeb3cda067;Xee97a80af;Xef21edf52;Xef7099b80;Xf30d583a3;Xf3bce077d;Xf3f964f79;Xf9a8b0128;Xfa4db12de;Xfadac1aa5;Xfae9b4244;Xfb6481e33;Xfb9aea390;Xfc6ecba62;Xfc892e57b;Xfd2ea16a6;Xfd83d04ba;Xfef47238f;Xff3d0455c,206,Architecture of a Conference Management System Providing Advanced Paper Assignment Features,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6934,2011

519,"One of the most interesting scientific challenges nowadays deals with the analysis and the understanding of complex networks' dynamics. A major issue is the definition of new frameworks for the exploration of the dynamics at play in real dynamic networks. Here, we focus on scientific communities by analyzing the ""social part"" of Science through a descriptive approach that aims at identifying the social determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions among individuals) behind the emergence and the resilience of scientific communities. We consider that scientific communities are at the same time communities of practice (through co-authorship) and that they exist also as representations in the scientists' mind, since references to other scientists' works is not merely an objective link to a relevant work, but it reveals social objects that one manipulates and refers to. In this paper we identify the patterns about the evolution of a scientific field by analyzing a portion of the arXiv repository covering a period of 10 years of publications in physics. As a citation represents a deliberative selection related to the relevance of a work in its scientific domain, our analysis approaches the co-existence between co-authorship and citation behaviors in a community by focusing on the most proficient and cited authors interactions patterns. We focus in turn, on how these patterns are affected by the selection process of citations. Such a selection a) produces self-organization because it is played by a group of individuals which act, compete and collaborate in a common environment in order to advance Science and b) determines the success (emergence) of both topics and scientists working on them. The dataset is analyzed a) at a global level, e.g. the network evolution, b) at the meso-level, e.g. communities emergence, and c) at a micro-level, e.g. nodes' aggregation patterns.","Quattrociocchi, Walter;Amblard, Frederic",ArXiv e-prints,X2bb907f9b;X3449a6e3e;X3954f5892;X3a0b664b9;X3f5c170c3;X520d37f95;X66d572f44;Xbc915ef9d;Xffd8f6ac6,9,Selection in Scientific Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4396,2010

This article takes a different approach by studying micro-level network properties, with the aim to apply centrality measures to impact analysis. Using coauthorship data from 16 journals in the field of library and information science (LIS) with a time span of twenty years (1988-2007), we construct an evolving coauthorship network and calculate four centrality measures (closeness, betweenness, degree and PageRank) for authors in this network. We find out that the four centrality measures are significantly correlated with citation counts. We also discuss the usability of centrality measures in author ranking, and suggest that centrality measures can be useful indicators for impact analysis.","Yan, Erjia;Ding, Ying",ArXiv e-prints,X026b830ae;X0306655af;X05ece1984;X07ee741e5;X08b0fdc59;X08bcce6f0;X0b9be8d9c;X0d538e4c9;X1111b085b;X15043d35b;X15a2c7cf2;X19d2c7c39;X1cd2415c6;X1f20f8cb3;X1f55f00f5;X277fb4dca;X29b00f4ac;X2a12a7973;X2bb1234ea;X2bdc4767d;X2f016851d;X36a5ad23a;X36a85d41e;X395f195dc;X3965c2df0;X3a723931f;X3ca6e6a15;X4078e6feb;X424663839;X45b8e45ff;X46be42b82;X47096b96b;X47f2fdb27;X4f7e6376a;X50973daf0;X5105b2348;X54b123cf9;X582d87a13;X5ac33f232;X6013a15e1;X6050bf5ca;X6726b4cde;X6863154de;X6c632d8b7;X6db8dd808;X71278febe;X72a5ba97e;X75f31813f;X776244a63;X778366dc3;X7a8c7a515;X818997476;X85104a654;X8e9bcfa5c;X9226bc074;X9226c1ddb;X949038b18;X96adb27ed;X99cc482d3;X9a7f438ee;X9b22ea53b;X9bc2e85d9;X9cec2fe9a;X9df8fbdb2;X9ee5628c5;Xa05cab890;Xa1621fd5c;Xa1b994b71;Xa20079001;Xa28926e28;Xa493b640f;Xa6f586ee6;Xa9157de34;Xa9420bcd8;Xaaeb55cca;Xaf675a9ff;Xb0756ad69;Xb2589a3ae;Xb430b3d53;Xb7a3dd223;Xb99103995;Xbb5773991;Xbcf345eea;Xbcfe42ce9;Xc12bbc7f8;Xc1aafe1f7;Xc440ae002;Xc5d89c3fe;Xc7b0035af;Xcb490be4e;Xd08ed74bc;Xd55ac1b3b;Xd645ebd3d;Xd82537ba7;Xd8f22b1b7;Xdf1f554b4;Xdf3b690b6;Xdf5fcce37;Xe510d4dc3;Xe7050eb7d;Xea4c18296;Xea5b899d5;Xec45acc64;Xec6e51643;Xed138445f;Xf510f5d90;Xf52d1b31b;Xf70827ff9;Xf732105fd;Xf7c57cc75,110,Applying centrality measures to impact analysis: A coauthorship network analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4862,2010
523,"As most electronic journals available today have been derived from print originals, print journals have become a vital element in the broad development of electronic journals publishing. Further dependence on the print publishing model, however, will be a constraint on the continuing development of e-journals, and a series of conflicts are likely to arise. Making the most of e-journals requires that a distinctive new publishing model is developed. We consider some of the issues that will be fundamental in this new model, starting with user motivations and some reported publisher experiences, both of which suggest a broadening desire for comprehensive linked archives. This leads in turn to questions about the impact of rights assignment by authors, in particular the common practice of giving exlusive rights to publishers for individual works. Some non-prescriptive solutions are suggested, and four steps towards optimum e-journals are proposed.","Hitchcock, Steve;Carr, Les;Hall, Wendy",ArXiv e-prints,,0,Making the most of electronic journals,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9812016,1998
524,"Keyphrases provide semantic metadata that summarize and characterize documents. This paper describes Kea, an algorithm for automatically extracting keyphrases from text. Kea identifies candidate keyphrases using lexical methods, calculates feature values for each candidate, and uses a machine-learning algorithm to predict which candidates are good keyphrases. The machine learning scheme first builds a prediction model using training documents with known keyphrases, and then uses the model to find keyphrases in new documents. We use a large test corpus to evaluate Kea's effectiveness in terms of how many author-assigned keyphrases are correctly identified. The system is simple, robust, and publicly available.","Witten, Ian H.;Paynter, Gordon W.;Frank, Eibe;Gutwin, Carl;Nevill-Manning, Craig G.",ArXiv e-prints,X05cfe9518;X0d09b97ce;X119a19857;X124bcd52e;X13c3e8f1a;X1633ea2b3;X1713b83cd;X186b5e696;X19594e402;X24272ff73;X26b9730f1;X28d989a6a;X2eb212ac1;X4213738f5;X42227ba87;X43af3f277;X4748867ff;X506ebd2b6;X53c768929;X564fc2219;X59be1e665;X5a8255a12;X5d6ca2b1a;X68694d29e;X69b0c7f62;X69f2c6302;X6feb5403b;X704c957e1;X75a86f133;X782dcf149;X7c34199d4;X7ebdc1120;X7f66c78e6;X816c1bb4a;X85e30d595;X86e9169d9;X89bf56274;X89f77f403;X8a7f46f97;Xac0cbe073;Xaed2dd9a4;Xaef2a9c82;Xb8528e6e1;Xb858273c6;Xbdba4f24a;Xc467c8e6a;Xc48aaf933;Xc6352a2a5;Xca6480401;Xd235b5035;Xd292b910e;Xd2fcffa72;Xd3d975fc4;Xd471bb8af;Xdb17092cf;Xe1e3a8e6d;Xe7050eb7d;Xf599d06df;Xfacc04420;Xfb23f85c3;Xfbba7c0e5;Xfc30228da;Xfdaf01d0b;Xff4c908c4,64,KEA: Practical Automatic Keyphrase Extraction,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902007,1999
525,"As web technologies evolve, web archivists work to keep up so that our digital history is preserved. Recent advances in web technologies have introduced client-side executed scripts that load data without a referential identifier or that require user interaction (e.g., content loading when the page has scrolled). These advances have made automating methods for capturing web pages more difficult. Because of the evolving schemes of publishing web pages along with the progressive capability of web preservation tools, the archivability of pages on the web has varied over time. In this paper we show that the archivability of a web page can be deduced from the type of page being archived, which aligns with that page's accessibility in respect to dynamic content. We show concrete examples of when these technologies were introduced by referencing mementos of pages that have persisted through a long evolution of available technologies. Identifying these reasons for the inability of these web pages to be archived in the past in respect to accessibility serves as a guide for ensuring that content that has longevity is published using good practice methods that make it available for preservation.","Kelly, Mat;Brunelle, Justin F.;Weigle, Michele C.;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X11637598e;X17721a747;X1a42d5766;X2018864a1;X32270d187;X44971bdab;X5835461e9;X66160b7bc;X7793f5670;X7db805b35;X8850fca4a;X8ce531d63;X9c03334d3;Xa1c1d993d;Xa80f4a570;Xc49002b73;Xc7cab06c0;Xcbc9052bb;Xd29b4fa71;Xdd9e02464;Xf3071ad35,21,On the Change in Archivability of Websites Over Time,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8067,2013

528,"Google's PageRank has created a new synergy to information retrieval for a better ranking of Web pages. It ranks documents depending on the topology of the graphs and the weights of the nodes. PageRank has significantly advanced the field of information retrieval and keeps Google ahead of competitors in the search engine market. It has been deployed in bibliometrics to evaluate research impact, yet few of these studies focus on the important impact of the damping factor (d) for ranking purposes. This paper studies how varied damping factors in the PageRank algorithm can provide additional insight into the ranking of authors in an author co-citation network. Furthermore, we propose weighted PageRank algorithms. We select 108 most highly cited authors in the information retrieval (IR) area from the 1970s to 2008 to form the author co-citation network. We calculate the ranks of these 108 authors based on PageRank with damping factor ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. In order to test the relationship between these different measures, we compare PageRank and weighted PageRank results with the citation ranking, h-index, and centrality measures. We found that in our author co-citation network, citation rank is highly correlated with PageRank's with different damping factors and also with different PageRank algorithms; citation rank and PageRank are not significantly correlated with centrality measures; and h-index is not significantly correlated with centrality measures.","Ding, Ying;Yan, Erjia;Frazho, Arthur;Caverlee, James",ArXiv e-prints,X0021e1e99;X01ae03181;X023b66b67;X047387feb;X061fa5ff2;X067fb93ea;X07fc38227;X08450ff48;X0c940ba3d;X0fb1565d2;X10d8e31da;X18c4d33de;X1d7ed5973;X1f76fb8d1;X243766437;X289470e07;X2946a4105;X2ccc3f39f;X2d82808e6;X2dacad245;X2dbc90bc9;X330d8eefd;X3820aaf1c;X3ce8f3761;X3f5b1717a;X40da77818;X41e1bc353;X43e4893f0;X4995f4577;X5134dc636;X529dde007;X52f9f6b1f;X54a8a793f;X553d64e17;X564343d80;X588d6b688;X58ae0a0f5;X59bfa2f0b;X5b8e89445;X5cd227e6a;X5f5b752c0;X630cf5211;X6669d8333;X695076479;X6ad5dea2f;X6bcfe89bf;X6c2a7b9d5;X6ea0208c4;X71649414a;X7350bf2d8;X755812ee9;X7565f981e;X77b75b6a0;X7a13ef509;X7ac0fbf72;X7dc9a7be2;X82d4e993c;X84e490bb6;X84ed8472c;X85c2d4c71;X86541d563;X886df29de;X89184e3a1;X8ae4bd9b5;X8b3d6a14a;X8b5bdbeeb;X8c895ea8a;X8e9bcfa5c;X98a35e194;X990fe743c;X9b803b015;X9bc2e85d9;X9bf22b5ad;X9f0fd7ce9;Xa15f5cdc5;Xa1b994b71;Xa2240ba39;Xa6ae701de;Xa8fe9fa3f;Xab5bdf72e;Xadd4997f4;Xaf95f0a06;Xb0ba8b030;Xb177e6f81;Xb232dbe46;Xb516a3650;Xb6c7a4881;Xb7461e266;Xba560021c;Xba99b296c;Xbb7ea0c19;Xc1635ccc9;Xc18a802bd;Xc1aafe1f7;Xc824e284a;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xccd8c6595;Xcfef00f56;Xd4d3bf957;Xdad6086b8;Xdf07da89a;Xdf5fcce37;Xdfa7da339;Xdfd2f3ea6;Xe0af56950;Xe260cfc22;Xe2dd25213;Xe3ff27609;Xe596b95bd;Xe6ad174b7;Xe801493e7;Xe88280bd8;Xec6e51643;Xeccf446f7;Xf353b134f;Xf380e87aa;Xf585d7c9f;Xf61ff8d28;Xfb8a26fa5;Xfe3598eda,120,PageRank for ranking authors in co-citation networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4872,2010

In this study, we use research on graphene and on solar cells to illustrate how RPYS functions, and what results it can deliver.","Marx, Werner;Bornmann, Lutz;Barth, Andreas;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X03268f2c0;X0b1caee63;X2d9b5521d;X32eb8c01d;X39168482e;X3eff05b28;X434a9c047;X441f01ede;X4f81a197c;X500206aa3;X51b66769f;X705c60ce2;X731bb4084;X751146017;X8b5d7be35;X8b771a13f;X911760f4f;X937a3501e;X96f2e38b3;X9ddaed002;X9e5eb8145;X9fec5dede;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa42157b2e;Xa79d211ad;Xab523e26d;Xb06aa336d;Xb4701a8d3;Xbdb1fd848;Xbfd5a92ac;Xc02687cbf;Xc98593585;Xd686b73f8;Xdbe29d008;Xdf50e53be;Xf344b93ab;Xf35508cd0;Xf430a29dd;Xf6bf186db,40,Detecting the historical roots of research fields by reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS),http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8239,2013
537,"As the Distributed Collection Manager's work on building tools to support users maintaining collections of changing web-based resources has progressed, questions about the characteristics of people's collections of web pages have arisen. Simultaneously, work in the areas of social bookmarking, social news, and subscription-based technologies have been taking the existence, usage, and utility of this data for granted with neither investigation into what people are doing with their collections nor how they are trying to maintain them. In order to address these concerns, we performed an online user study of 125 individuals from a variety of online and offline communities, such as the reddit social news user community and the graduate student body in our department. From this study we were able to examine a user's needs for a system to manage their web-based distributed collections, how their current tools affect their ability to maintain their collections, and what the characteristics of their current practices and problems in maintaining their web-based collections were. We also present extensions and improvements being made to the system both in order to adapt DCM for usage in the Ensemble project and to meet the requirements found by our user study.","Logasa Bogen, Paul, II;Shipman, Frank;Furuta, Richard",ArXiv e-prints,X06b4544d0;X47be263a2;X6ea0208c4;X6fc6944d8;X828a80caa;Xb8dd72620;Xd654f3b05;Xfafb9b629,8,Distributed Collections of Web Pages in the Wild,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0613,2011
538,"This paper is about a better understanding on the structure and dynamics of science and the usage of these insights for compensating the typical problems that arises in metadata-driven Digital Libraries. Three science model driven retrieval services are presented: co-word analysis based query expansion, re-ranking via Bradfordizing and author centrality. The services are evaluated with relevance assessments from which two important implications emerge: (1) precision values of the retrieval service are the same or better than the tf-idf retrieval baseline and (2) each service retrieved a disjoint set of documents. The different services each favor quite other - but still relevant - documents than pure term-frequency based rankings. The proposed models and derived retrieval services therefore open up new viewpoints on the scientific knowledge space and provide an alternative framework to structure scholarly information systems.","Mayr, Philipp;Schaer, Philipp;Mutschke, Peter",ArXiv e-prints,X3d03b6fa4;X6be837466;Xa1b994b71;Xc6b0c586e;Xebcecc342,5,A Science Model Driven Retrieval Prototype,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1637,2011

541,"Scientometric data is used to investigate empirically the emergence of search regimes in Biotechnology, Genomics, and Nanotechnology. Complex regimes can emerge when three independent sources of variance interact. In our model, researchers can be considered as the nodes that carry the science system. Research is geographically situated with site-specific skills, tacit knowledge and infrastructures. Second, the emergent science level refers to the formal communication of codified knowledge published in journals. Third, the socio-economic dynamics indicate the ways in which knowledge production relates to society. Although Biotechnology, Genomics, and Nanotechnology can all be characterised by rapid growth and divergent dynamics, the regimes differ in terms of self-organization among these three sources of variance. The scope of opportunities for researchers to contribute within the constraints of the existing body of knowledge are different in each field. Furthermore, the relevance of the context of application contributes to the knowledge dynamics to various degrees.","Heimeriks, Gaston;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X06d4e3293;X0a282949c;X0f833ae96;X240a7eb3a;X47872f183;X7333d5c95;X78b69fdbc;X85554e3e4;X8719ead01;X96f2e38b3;X9b83e88d8;X9dc71f356;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa3dadcd4c;Xbbcd97732;Xc4d08b458;Xc6fec0dfb;Xd2f4635fc;Xe25f1af81;Xefbfd07d0;Xfc94cd325,22,"Emerging Search Regimes: Measuring Co-evolutions among Research, Science, and Society",http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2591,2011

This challenge comes from the fact that different types of conventions might be followed among different research discipline or research groups.

543,"Colombian scientific journals are poorly represented in international digital libraries; however, through Google Scholar (GS) it is possible to determine their use by the community. Between the years of 2003 and 2007 a classification of 185 Colombian journals indexed in the Colombian National Bibliographical Index (IBNP) was performed using the information provided by GS, basing categorization on size indicators, indexation and citation. The indicators were analyzed by grouping the journals in two general areas: sciences and social sciences. In each area, the indicators provided by the digital libraries Scopus, Redalyc and Scielo were compared. Additionally, the indicators provided by IBNP journals categories (A1, A2, B and C) were also compared. The sciences and social sciences had a similar pattern in their indicators. The existence of positive correlations was established between some indicators and they predicted that the number of citations per journal in GS and the h index depends on its visibility in GS and Scopus. We put forward that the current IBNP categories (A1, A2, B or C) faintly reflect the use of journals by the community and we propose a classification based on the h index as an infometric indicator, which reflects not only its visibility in Google Scholar, but also its inclusion in certain international digital libraries, particularly Scopus. Our results may be applied to the creation of public policies regarding science and technology in Colombia and in developing countries.","Romero-Torres, Mauricio;Tejada, Maria Alejandra;Acosta, Alberto",ArXiv e-prints,X07712c9ad;X17ebd1293;X1b8c88729;X2132cbff8;X2347d0854;X23cfe509b;X2641a5387;X2c6fdfdf7;X343a21249;X3e74fb7ef;X418cb4e68;X438cd6522;X461d5418c;X47287f6d4;X4d75aa092;X4ea8e34f9;X4f285fe15;X52bf1e7ee;X555e4023b;X5824bf4e3;X625dc43dc;X62acc3a3d;X668bdcfa1;X6af6c4355;X6beb716f9;X6c7e4d3d7;X6ca84322d;X6ced20c26;X6ef039176;X701f08843;X7173d5b21;X75baaf6ac;X80368ef67;X8c861b5e6;X9223a49b0;X9389fd7ed;X9baf4cb42;X9f2179db4;Xa12fda2b6;Xa2a44404e;Xb4bb089d0;Xb6a1b3570;Xc29360308;Xc4844ef59;Xcd7c906f9;Xcdd852616;Xcdf832825;Xcf67607a2;Xcfd10f975;Xd3618211a;Xd383ea054;Xd8ecf5c98;Xde5bd65c8;Xecdd2d081;Xee2d9896f;Xf01dae3c7;Xf0974a07c;Xf37ce1584;Xf5a83abcf;Xf83a60dcd;Xfb37a4906;Xfecb8f422,62,A Proposal to Classify Latinamerican Scientific Journals using Citation Indicators: Case Study in Colombia,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2711,2011
544,"We apply bio-inspired methods for the analysis of different dynamic bibliometric networks (linking papers by citation, authors, and keywords, respectively). Biological species are clusters of individuals defined by widely different criteria and in the biological perspective it is natural to (1) use different categorizations on the same entities (2) to compare the different categorizations and to analyze the dissimilarities, especially as they change over time. We employ the same methodology to comparisons of bibliometric classifications. We constructed them as analogs of three species concepts: cladistic or lineage based, similarity based, and ""biological species"" (based on co-reproductive ability). We use the Rand and Jaccard indexes to compare classifications in different time intervals. The experiment is aimed to address the classic problem of science mapping, as to what extent the various techniques based on different bibliometric indicators, such as citations, keywords or authors are able to detect convergent structures in the litrerature, that is, to identify coherent specialities or research directions and their dynamics.","Soos, Sandor;Kampis, George",ArXiv e-prints,X037e3dfd0;X09acf13fb;X12c4ece07;X1698f45fe;X3b17f9e72;X3e7046927;X417c9d48c;X4a1c624ef;X5a8bc1390;X5b70d97d9;X72c73a5d5;X7689de318;X7c5d02b4d;X894777fcc;Xa0c327b3d;Xa1b994b71;Xaf0cc7a57;Xcde94a501;Xd0a63bf40;Xd9755c4c4;Xded166ee7;Xdf7ab818b;Xe2c858a24;Xed0dabca8;Xf30ecf01c;Xf7191b37d;Xf7ae615c8;Xff114f2a5,28,Bio-inspired Methods for Dynamic Network Analysis in Science Mapping,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3684,2011

547,"We submit newly developed citation impact indicators based not on arithmetic averages of citations but on percentile ranks. Citation distributions are-as a rule-highly skewed and should not be arithmetically averaged. With percentile ranks, the citation of each paper is rated in terms of its percentile in the citation distribution. The percentile ranks approach allows for the formulation of a more abstract indicator scheme that can be used to organize and/or schematize different impact indicators according to three degrees of freedom: the selection of the reference sets, the evaluation criteria, and the choice of whether or not to define the publication sets as independent. Bibliometric data of seven principal investigators (PIs) of the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam is used as an exemplary data set. We demonstrate that the proposed indicators [R(6), R(100), R(6,k), R(100,k)] are an improvement of averages-based indicators because one can account for the shape of the distributions of citations over papers.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Bornmann, Lutz;Mutz, Rüdiger;Opthof, Tobias",ArXiv e-prints,X036f6f00c;X0ef86b2af;X16f74039e;X213de4a67;X25db0ffdc;X3f82c45ef;X511ce22e5;X5a5b11785;X5fe8944a0;X612cb1ecc;X6219ca39b;X8801f9389;X8e66da2d0;X9d05cfc6d;X9dc71f356;Xb6b822cc9;Xb9c4c1c31;Xc369f5355;Xc84c37b03;Xd3613eaa7,20,Turning the tables in citation analysis one more time: Principles for comparing sets of documents,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3863,2011

We suggest that the set of citing papers can be considered as the relevant representation of the field of impact. In order to normalize for differences in citation behavior among fields, citations can be fractionally counted proportionately to the length of the reference lists in the citing papers. This new method enables us to compare among units with different disciplinary affiliations at the paper level and also to assess the statistical significance of differences among sets.

550,"There are a number of solutions that perform unsupervised name disambiguation based on the similarity of bibliographic records or common co-authorship patterns. Whether the use of these advanced methods, which are often difficult to implement, is warranted depends on whether the accuracy of the most basic disambiguation methods, which only use the author's last name and initials, is sufficient for a particular purpose. We derive realistic estimates for the accuracy of simple, initials-based methods using simulated bibliographic datasets in which the true identities of authors are known. Based on the simulations in five diverse disciplines we find that the first initial method already correctly identifies 97% of authors. An alternative simple method, which takes all initials into account, is typically two times less accurate, except in certain datasets that can be identified by applying a simple criterion. Finally, we introduce a new name-based method that combines the features of first initial and all initials methods by implicitly taking into account the last name frequency and the size of the dataset. This hybrid method reduces the fraction of incorrectly identified authors by 10-30% over the first initial method.","Milojević, Staša",ArXiv e-prints,X0b559beb5;X17de83a72;X1f45b3525;X21a343885;X257d9e070;X258f87d4a;X30c1d3f48;X38ab1d3f9;X3c3595dab;X42937bbdf;X45f4344a8;X4e12d5608;X5a7207132;X5ebc69361;X629951f0d;X67bf93cd8;X69c2b77d8;X6e85d89ef;X7115fae5f;X760883c51;X76965cbb3;X8ce0b06ac;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa37748b0d;Xa4e143dc3;Xba5e2b840;Xbcdccf449;Xc1b416486;Xca719cf0a;Xd5d895ea0;Xd5f512827;Xd755fccfd;Xdfbfd75cd;Xe90f9a9da;Xe9b2c463e;Xe9ca4a14c;Xea95d60c3;Xf799f28de;Xf81f94955;Xfdf2a868b,40,"Accuracy of simple, initials-based methods for author name disambiguation",http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0749,2013
551,"The purpose of this paper is to take that first step in helping archivists understand the video game industry by examining the documents and assets created by game companies. This paper is intended as a survey of the records generated during video game production, and an overview of why and how those records are created. It is not intended to be a statement on archiving best practices, but rather a tool for archivists to use when assessing and processing video game collections.

552,"An earlier paper (Szalay et. al. ""Designing and Mining MultiTerabyte Astronomy Archives: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"" ACM SIGMOD 2000) described the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's (SDSS) data management needs by defining twenty database queries and twelve data visualization tasks that a good data management system should support. We built a database and interfaces to support both the query load and also a website for ad-hoc access. This paper reports on the database design, describes the data loading pipeline, and reports on the query implementation and performance. The queries typically translated to a single SQL statement. Most queries run in less than 20 seconds, allowing scientists to interactively explore the database. This paper is an in-depth tour of those queries.

553,"For discovering the new URI of a missing web page, lexical signatures, which consist of a small number of words chosen to represent the ""aboutness"" of a page, have been previously proposed. However, prior methods relied on computing the lexical signature before the page was lost, or using cached or archived versions of the page to calculate a lexical signature. We demonstrate a system of constructing a lexical signature for a page from its link neighborhood, that is the ""backlinks"", or pages that link to the missing page. After testing various methods, we show that one can construct a lexical signature for a missing web page using only ten backlink pages. Further, we show that only the first level of backlinks are useful in this effort. The text that the backlinks use to point to the missing page is used as input for the creation of a four-word lexical signature. That lexical signature is shown to successfully find the target URI in over half of the test cases.","Ware, Jeb;Klein, Martin;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X0984b2eb2;X12ab07b25;X2d0a1d83b;X3e29478d4;X47cc4b4cc;X4e12d5608;X649e9bfbd;X7b2ea424c;Xa4d3c3ac1;Xa5a23759d;Xb5502e10d;Xb5ca1723a;Xdfb4701e5;Xf22f567a5,14,An Evaluation of Link Neighborhood Lexical Signatures to Rediscover Missing Web Pages,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0930,2011

Our analysis considers only regular papers as we do not include short papers, demo papers, posters, tutorials or panels into our statistics.

555,"The structural properties of the network generated by the editorial activities of the members of the boards of ""Information Science & Library Science"" journals are explored through network analysis techniques. The crossed presence of scholars on editorial boards, the phenomenon called interlocking editorship, is considered a proxy of the similarity of editorial policies. The evidences support the idea that this group of journals is better described as a set of only relatively connected subfields. In particular two main subfield are identified, consisting of research oriented journals devoted respectively to LIS and MIS. The links between these two subsets are weak. Around these two subsets there are a lot of (relatively) isolated professional journals or journals characterized more by their subject-matter content than by their focus on information flows. It is possible to suggest that this configuration of the network may be the consequence of the youthfulness of Information Science & Library Science, which has not permitted yet to reach a general consensus through scholars on research aims, methods and instruments.","Baccini, Alberto",ArXiv e-prints,X21eade0f0;X81fe06c4c;X9cdcc90a5;Xa7ce96630;Xd90aca05d,5,Seats at the table: the network of the editorial boards in information and library science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1167,2011
556,"The ongoing globalisation of science has undisputedly a major impact on how and where scientific research is being conducted nowadays. Yet, the big picture remains blurred. It is largely unknown where this process is heading, and at which rate. Which countries are leading or lagging? Many of its key features are difficult if not impossible to capture in measurements and comparative statistics. Our empirical study measures the extent and growth of scientific globalisation in terms of physical distances between co-authoring researchers. Our analysis, drawing on 21 million research publications across all countries and fields of science, reveals that contemporary science has globalised at a fairly steady rate during recent decades. The average collaboration distance per publication has increased from 334 kilometres in 1980 to 1553 in 2009. Despite significant differences in globalisation rates across countries and fields of science, we observe a pervasive process in motion, moving towards a truly interconnected global science system.","Waltman, Ludo;Tijssen, Robert J.

557,"The exploratory analysis developed in this paper relies on the hypothesis that each editor possesses some power in the definition of the editorial policy of her journal. Consequently if the same scholar sits on the board of editors of two journals, those journals could have some common elements in their editorial policies. The proximity of the editorial policies of two scientific journals can be assessed by the number of common editors sitting on their boards. A database of all editors of ECONLIT journals is used. The structure of the network generated by interlocking editorship is explored by applying the instruments of network analysis. Evidences have been found of a compact network containing different components. This is interpreted as the result of a plurality of perspectives about the appropriate methods for the investigation of problems and the construction of theories within the domain of economics.","Baccini, Alberto;Barabesi, Lucio",ArXiv e-prints,5517eef458;X078b81252;Xa1b994b71;Xbb7ac5f18;Xc855e1f8e;Xcf3833542;Xfdffcd3e8,7,Interlocking editorship.

558,"Astronomical data are gathered through a very large number of heterogeneous techniques and stored in very diversified and often incompatible data repositories. Moreover in the e-science environment, it is needed to integrate services across distributed, heterogeneous, dynamic ""virtual organizations"" formed by different resources within a single enterprise and/or external resource sharing and service provider relationships. The DAME/VONeural project, run jointly by the University Federico II, INAF (National Institute of Astrophysics) Astronomical Observatories of Napoli and the California Institute of Technology, aims at creating a single, sustainable, distributed e-infrastructure for data mining and exploration in massive data sets, to be offered to the astronomical (but not only) community as a web application. The framework makes use of distributed computing environments (e.g. S.Co.P.E.) and matches the international IVOA standards and requirements. The integration process is technically challenging due to the need of achieving a specific quality of service when running on top of different native platforms.

559,"Using the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI) 2008, we apply mapping techniques previously developed for mapping journal structures in the Science and Social Science Citation Indices. Citation relations among the 110,718 records were aggregated at the level of 1,157 journals specific to the A&HCI, and the journal structures are questioned on whether a cognitive structure can be reconstructed and visualized. Both cosine-normalization (bottom up) and factor analysis (top down) suggest a division into approximately twelve subsets. The relations among these subsets are explored using various visualization techniques. However, we were not able to retrieve this structure using the ISI Subject Categories, including the 25 categories which are specific to the A&HCI. We discuss options for validation such as against the categories of the Humanities Indicators of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the panel structure of the European Reference Index for the Humanities (ERIH), and compare our results with the curriculum organization of the Humanities Section of the College of Letters and Sciences of UCLA as an example of institutional organization.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Hammarfelt, Björn;Almila Akdag Salah, Alkim",ArXiv e-prints,54f8e86d2d;X0066a3014;X0122b7b30;X07ee741e5;X08385e5de;X0954e8445;X0ad7d1aac;X0ce902013;X0e42cb055;X0fb1565d2;X106d0771e;X142607ef7;X1612be037;X194ca5b6f;X1c90723be;X1eb0b7ebd;X204bb50cb;X2497b4093;X2748a5528;X2a77d31ce;X2a794c1d2;X2e153d10f;X3285d6c86;X328d2738e;X33c3c7cd3;X36d5765e6;X384015f3a;X4008bffd0;X411572df4;X460bbf60b;X471fc699a;X4aae33fa4;X4b211b8f8;X4b6096a9a;X53132750c;X56df73d6b;X58938aa1a;X58ced5304;X5ac00d20c;X744cb4932;X7511d3084;X7668464ed;X771266220;X7ad79e4c0;X7b116c5e4;X7baeaa77f;X808e4a215;X847b92f51;X886c090f6;X94e7b8299;X98aefbd98;X9a35dfaac;X9bb2bb9db;Xa0565ae19;Xa1b994b71;Xa405bf2de;Xa731f0511;Xa875451b9;Xa9ba108c8;Xad63d9e43;Xad8bc15a2;Xae1b0222a;Xb15002f89;Xb516a3650;Xbab3c8ee6;Xbccbca514;Xbf7ccbeea;Xc02687cbf;Xc86a054ca;Xcab98a617;Xcd3273da3;Xd339a4108;Xd4f5fb248;Xdcd36884b;Xe5b9146eb;Xe658bd602;Xe74bacd98;Xe8188f51d;Xeba20dc9d;Xecab8eeb1;Xecdaa08f7;Xf0b8dd35b;Xf415d60bd;Xf56e36f87;Xf573b45cf;Xf6bc9fd60;Xfd661d439,87,"The structure of the Arts & Humanities Citation Index: A mapping on the basis of aggregated citations among 1,157 journals",http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1934,2011

Information Retrieval (IR) was selected as a test field and data from 1956-2008 were collected from Web of Science (WOS). Weighted PageRank with citation and publication as weighted vectors were calculated on author citation networks. The results indicate that both popularity rank and prestige rank were highly correlated with the weighted PageRank. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to detect relationships among these different measures. For capturing prize winners within the IR field, prestige rank outperformed all the other measures.","Ding, Ying",ArXiv e-prints,X023b66b67;X061225058;X0a34fa101;X0bda578db;X1729f4d86;X1b44e6250;X1b6bf501a;X1b759dd87;X1faa2f9a8;X22200e077;X234eb7623;X274d5426b;X29b00f4ac;X2a1b4b935;X30cd2689b;X315e2ef36;X37d455d09;X3eab2a964;X3f4f367e4;X44e222557;X49877bb3b;X49992e3a1;X4cd601719;X4f45ebcfd;X57c3966cf;X5df17651d;X610fe2329;X614c46355;X63ff2df85;X65a2a9516;X66736d567;X6ad5dea2f;X6b40ec031;X6d04af6b8;X71a1e6adf;X77b729c33;X77ba8ac9b;X7dbda3b19;X7e61d974a;X862a31899;X891f627ba;X90b1f06d9;X933f89a10;X93c37b9ab;X9a8784c05;Xa1b994b71;Xa7e51adad;Xa8fe9fa3f;Xa909e8592;Xae4c0550e;Xb99ddbcf9;Xbbfb7566c;Xbddc4b676;Xbe705b9c1;Xbfec25ee6;Xc31045718;Xc44d04938;Xc76c90f2c;Xc9197bc1c;Xc93cf9a53;Xcc7a84760;Xd40266ba1;Xd50869bf4;Xd8b369c2b;Xdb3501e33;Xdf54afe8f;Xdfd86e0ff;Xdfe4a29ad;Xe596b95bd;Xec75c567b;Xeddd0927e;Xef78ec659;Xf24e0317b;Xf43a60ccc;Xf8a55b447;Xfb8a26fa5;Xfd4017914,77,Applying weighted PageRank to author citation networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1760,2011

563,"In reaction to a previous critique(Opthof & Leydesdorff, 2010), the Center for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) in Leiden proposed to change their old ""crown"" indicator in citation analysis into a new one. Waltman et al. (2011)argue that this change does not affect rankings at various aggregated levels. However, CWTS data is not publicly available for testing and criticism. In this correspondence, we use previously published data of Van Raan (2006) to address the pivotal issue of how the results of citation analysis correlate with the results of peer review. A quality parameter based on peer review was neither significantly correlated with the two parameters developed by the CWTS in the past (CPP/JCSm or CPP/FCSm) nor with the more recently proposed h-index (Hirsch, 2005). Given the high correlations between the old and new ""crown"" indicators, one can expect that the lack of correlation with the peer-review based quality indicator applies equally to the newly developed ones.","Opthof, Tobias;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X6219ca39b;X7299b406d;X9dc71f356;Xa0ef06452;Xe9400a319,5,Citation analysis cannot legitimate the strategic selection of excellence,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2569,2011
564,"The Hirsch index (commonly referred to as h-index) is a bibliometric indicator which is widely recognized as effective for measuring the scientific production of a scholar since it summarizes size and impact of the research output. In a formal setting, the h-index is actually an empirical functional of the distribution of the citation counts received by the scholar. Under this approach, the asymptotic theory for the empirical h-index has been recently exploited when the citation counts follow a continuous distribution and, in particular, variance estimation has been considered for the Pareto-type and the Weibull-type distribution families. However, in bibliometric applications, citation counts display a distribution supported by the integers. Thus, we provide general properties for the empirical h-index under the small- and large-sample settings. In addition, we also introduce consistent nonparametric variance estimation, which allows for the implemention of large-sample set estimation for the theoretical h-index.","Pratelli, Luca;Baccini, Alberto;Barabesi, Lucio;Marcheselli, Marzia",ArXiv e-prints,X0455abc7d;X048cf5808;X23e530357;X3bb9b3b5e;X4bd5ec313;X4f07eb73a;X7126c3bad;X890f2ec2a;X9895605ee;Xab5bbe52e;Xd53a167c1;Xf2ec8245a;Xf78d28a87,13,Statistical analysis of the Hirsch Index,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2701,2011

566,"The Web graph is a giant social network whose properties have been measured and modeled extensively in recent years. Most such studies concentrate on the graph structure alone, and do not consider textual properties of the nodes. Consequently, Web communities have been characterized purely in terms of graph structure and not on page content. We propose that a topic taxonomy such as Yahoo! or the Open Directory provides a useful framework for understanding the structure of content-based clusters and communities. In particular, using a topic taxonomy and an automatic classifier, we can measure the background distribution of broad topics on the Web, and analyze the capability of recent random walk algorithms to draw samples which follow such distributions. In addition, we can measure the probability that a page about one broad topic will link to another broad topic. Extending this experiment, we can measure how quickly topic context is lost while walking randomly on the Web graph. Estimates of this topic mixing distance may explain why a global PageRank is still meaningful in the context of broad queries. In general, our measurements may prove valuable in the design of community-specific crawlers and link-based ranking systems.","Chakrabarti, Soumen;Joshi, Mukul M.;Punera, Kunal;Pennock, David M.",ArXiv e-prints,553ef45694;X016075225;X021f11ab6;X03d404573;X0446777c6;X07ed07f0e;X0cd328ff2;X0d95dbccd;X0ec59231e;X15afb67f8;X181774f1e;X226fda4b4;X22c35a86f;X23b81a2d4;X258086b28;X25b1ea78d;X2689001bd;X283985116;X2de77c8fc;X2f030e53d;X308e252f6;X382822196;X38caa9449;X3acd51b9a;X3dfe5b0cf;X406a163c6;X41d73c5f9;X4969ab03f;X4ae7a6b1b;X4f132b37f;X4ff863bfe;X5095ef3e9;X509ecb0b5;X5427a1492;X543ffc1f9;X57bb7d168;X6094d2c84;X6643ca21d;X6767a86a1;X727d1ed49;X7570f7bbf;X75a11f43e;X7616ba069;X7a0792e23;X7cbbc2676;X7d8bb3e51;X7dae6968a;X7fa7635d1;X83f8602a3;X84c4a6bf2;X85e07dd06;X8638dbb73;X8993265dd;X89a199d97;X9044a7f18;X91fbab43a;X930544021;X932a7de28;X956567f6c;X95e645369;X98e3d7d8e;X9d27dc571;X9d611f52a;Xa233b67e8;Xa8179784e;Xab6148654;Xad49964bc;Xb0ae097b3;Xb5aa3cddf;Xc0fb04d69;Xc21904310;Xc48b6260a;Xca5e992cb;Xd1871e80e;Xd1b83a917;Xd22cdc89c;Xd2e198aa5;Xd6ae8831e;Xd93784e2d;Xdec4b1795;Xe06004c4c;Xe1635aa70;Xe34695311;Xe43dc6725;Xe91177dba;Xecff28a43;Xeeed3adca;Xf2ed5294c;Xf34315b3c;Xf593658fc;Xf68baf492;Xf7847e4a5;Xfa97c5f3b;Xfdfd30183,94,The structure of broad topics on the Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0203024,2002

568,"Multivariate linear regression models suggest a trade-off in allocations of national R&D investments. Government funding, and spending in the higher education sector, seem to encourage publications, whereas other components such as industrial funding, and spending in the business sector, encourage patenting. Our results help explain why the US trails the EU in publications, because of its focus on industrial funding - some 70% of its total R&D investment. Conversely, it also helps explain why the EU trails the US in patenting. Government funding is indicated as a negative incentive to high-quality patenting. The models here can also be used to predict an output indicator for a country, once the appropriate input indicator is known. This usually is done within a dataset for a single year, but the process can be extended to predict outputs a few years into the future, if reasonable forecasts can be made of the input indicators. We provide new forecasts about the further relationships of the US, the EU-27, and the PRC in the case of publishing.

569,"Nowadays, many scientific areas share the same broad requirements of being able to deal with massive and distributed datasets while, when possible, being integrated with services and applications. In order to solve the growing gap between the incremental generation of data and our understanding of it, it is required to know how to access, retrieve, analyze, mine and integrate data from disparate sources. One of the fundamental aspects of any new generation of data mining software tool or package which really wants to become a service for the community is the possibility to use it within complex workflows which each user can fine tune in order to match the specific demands of his scientific goal. These workflows need often to access different resources (data, providers, computing facilities and packages) and require a strict interoperability on (at least) the client side. The project DAME (DAta Mining & Exploration) arises from these requirements by providing a distributed WEB-based data mining infrastructure specialized on Massive Data Sets exploration with Soft Computing methods. Originally designed to deal with astrophysical use cases, where first scientific application examples have demonstrated its effectiveness, the DAME Suite results as a multi-disciplinary platform-independent tool perfectly compliant with modern KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) requirements and Information & Communication Technology trends.","Brescia, M.;Cavuoti, S.;D'Abrusco, R.;Laurino, O.;Longo, G.",ArXiv e-prints,X006e1a483;X02d2abb47;X03b12f293;X085a550e3;X0d61e812a;X105f2f44b;X19b3d9751;X1fa467890;X267374d83;X271e4bd2d;X42ca577dc;X445fc5fa9;X4a530c133;X4fee25e1d;X5e7b99954;X62a63a742;X70b749ca5;X793b92314;X79e1bd8b0;X8f14776cd;X8f45b8972;X9c003fb0a;X9cf918b2e;X9d1be04b9;Xa62fdb0de;Xa65a4123e;Xaaade3f59;Xab2cb08d1;Xb0b62b5c5;Xb114e0fd5;Xb385f695f;Xbb8974a9d;Xbd40e4592;Xc52a39115;Xcc097f739;Xcc71f1d7c;Xd7caaf025;Xd7fbcc886;Xd96c11e4f;Xdfe39557b;Xe0b81bc38;Xe803e0842;Xf2fe839f8;Xfef682430,44,DAME: A Distributed Data Mining & Exploration Framework within the Virtual Observatory,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0750,2011

Furthermore, paper bricks may be implemented with minimal change to the existing peer review systems.","Dittrich, Jens",ArXiv e-prints,X05357450b;X058c9cfe8;X058ea5f88;X0741481fb;X0ca4f5efe;X10db0a383;X118c00721;X141d1c084;X17b0e1618;X1bcc9d8ff;X1de2af562;X1e7c6b4c0;X200c12d21;X2066948c5;X21905cbe7;X22eb78f99;X243a32d8b;X26195d248;X295c1bfc1;X2be902d1c;X2c5e49aed;X2e14c7105;X2e5c2eec7;X2f4e94ec4;X33cf9a7f0;X358a0f27a;X389d24604;X3bdd9ed6b;X3c01706c5;X3d15fd61b;X437bdd50a;X44dd70736;X4553b9313;X463346924;X471efb18e;X48770d277;X4b3d5e959;X4f467e1ff;X4f4d05f25;X54baf549b;X55312822c;X598d88ed6;X5a00be3f7;X5d21e31d8;X609dc2f44;X63379f306;X64609428c;X648ab22d4;X68b7054af;X692b5706d;X6a2d2d634;X70a27c30d;X738696fec;X7a28aa15c;X7beded28b;X7d0486d62;X80e2e4263;X8517da0bf;X8571f8c2a;X8d3b9af31;X8d6a9a126;X8edd334dc;X9413aa988;X94eed9187;X94ff89c72;X9587e51f9;X95d4a527f;X9a78de02e;X9b40ddae6;Xa065a8b14;Xa4d59ecbe;Xa500a4783;Xa59439a74;Xaa0f87985;Xaa86a983e;Xac6ce6f6f;Xaf380074d;Xaf79f1491;Xb1c9832e3;Xb1d56f607;Xb4660d8fc;Xb47da3eb3;Xb55fe73df;Xb75273b5b;Xb791caf0c;Xb7d0edf46;Xb7f199b92;Xb9652c26e;Xb9da77ea3;Xbaa2ec848;Xbc8694f95;Xbca0ea26d;Xc16ec6dd5;Xc31843929;Xc433e8e27;Xc47feb959;Xc506e9a15;Xc75a5072b;Xc78e64d98;Xc7c148f9a;Xc7fbf6577;Xc82bc96f1;Xc9143a592;Xcb0ddff3a;Xcb2e783b0;Xcc77635b3;Xccff94569;Xce3a251d2;Xd7963fa3c;Xd88365ed0;Xd8d641fd7;Xdc60f1aa4;Xde2e8738c;Xdef96f2ca;Xe08a489bd;Xe31acf1dc;Xf1d928515;Xf341cdb65;Xf4435ef18;Xf4cfffa2c;Xf7de39318;Xf8d7a2d89;Xfa756e051;Xfad95c18c;Xfaf97ad25,125,PaperBricks: An Alternative to Complete-Story Peer Reviewing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3523,2011

572,"Using a recently developed model, inspired by mean field theory in statistical physics, and data from the UK's Research Assessment Exercise, we analyse the relationship between the qualities of statistics and operational research groups and the quantities of researchers in them. Similar to other academic disciplines, we provide evidence for a linear dependency of quality on quantity up to an upper critical mass, which is interpreted as the average maximum number of colleagues with whom a researcher can communicate meaningfully within a research group. The model also predicts a lower critical mass, which research groups should strive to achieve to avoid extinction. For statistics and operational research, the lower critical mass is estimated to be 9 ± 3. The upper critical mass, beyond which research quality does not significantly depend on group size, is 17 ± 6.","Kenna, Ralph;Berche, Bertrand",International Journal of Modern Physics Conference Series,X03e71972f;X07c71a0ba;X3c7c09d68;X51707fae1;X6ccd3fed1;X6e86704b1;X75844c0ff;X8a8ec9f07;X975c6ba9c;Xc0b8bb925;Xc7b7cb04a;Xd1d3b2250;Xefa99e201;Xf7cdaba63,14,Statistics of Statisticians: Critical Mass of Statistics and Operational Research Groups,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4914,2012
573,"Devising a scheme for evaluating the service quality of an institutional electronic library is a difficult and challenging task. The challenge comes from the fact that the services provided by an institutional electronic library depend upon the contents requested by the users and the contents housed by the library. Different types of users might be interested in different types of contents. In this paper, we propose a technique for evaluating the service quality of an institutional electronic library. Our scheme is based on the service profiles of contents requested by the users at the server side which is hosted at the library. Further, we propose models to analyze the service quality of an electronic library. For analyzing the service quality, we present two analytical models. The first one is based on the number of days by which the item to be served by the library is delayed and the penalty points per day for the duration for which the item is delayed. The second model is based on the credits earned by the library if the item is served in a timely fashion, and the penalties, thereof, if the item is delayed. These models may help in evaluating the service quality of an electronic library and taking the corrective measures to improve it.","Abbas, Ash Mohammad",ArXiv e-prints,X06c64f558;X3f8c07609;X6ba7866f1;Xe726ae13d,4,An Analytical Model for Service Profile Based Service Quality of an Institutional eLibrary,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4078,2011
574,"Astronomy has long had a working network of archives supporting the curation of publications and data. The discipline has already created many of the features which perplex other areas of science: (1) data repositories: (supra)national institutes, dedicated to large projects; a culture of user-contributed data; practical experience of long-term data preservation; (2) dataset identifiers: the community has already piloted experiments, knows what can undermine these efforts, and is participating in the development of next-generation standards; (3) citation of datasets in papers: the community has an innovative and expanding infrastructure for the curation of data and bibliographic resources, and through them a community of authors and editors familiar with such electronic publication efforts; as well, it has experimented with next-generation web standards (e.g. the Semantic Web); (4) publisher buy-in: publishers in this area have been willing to innovate within the constraints of their commercial imperatives. What can possibly be missing?  Why don't we have an integrated framework for the publication and preservation of all data products already?  Are there technical barriers?  We don't believe so. Are there cultural or commercial forces inhibiting this?  We aren't aware of any.

575,"This review addresses the question of what exactly should we preserve, and how the digital preservation community and scholars address this question. The paper first introduces the much-abused-term ""significant properties,"" before revealing how some scholars are of the opinion that characteristics of digital objects to be preserved (i.e., significant properties) can be identified and should be expressed formally, while others are not of that opinion. The digital preservation community's attempt to expound on the general characteristics of digital objects and significant properties will then be discussed. Finally, the review shows that while there may be ways to identify the technical makeup or general characteristics of a digital object, there is currently no formal and objective methodology to help stakeholders identify and decide what the significant properties of the objects are. This review thus helps open questions and generates a formative recommendation based on expert opinion that expressing an object's functions in an explicit and formal way (using didactic guides from the archives community) could be the solution to help stakeholders decide what characteristics/ elements exactly we should preserve.","Tyan Low, Jyue",ArXiv e-prints,X0f51d5603;X1ce0b2149;X229176689;X2f615d818;X2fbcd7c1b;X332229be4;X39b71c89d;X3f60d5682;X42ff1c488;X453a162ba;X4ab040308;X4e5ba4fc2;X4e683155f;X5dd7c03b2;X69be65931;X6fd1f8f22;X724cc0205;X737ac393e;X73d0d34b6;X7a60c7f9c;X84fc6bb8a;X858044a13;X8b68d0b9f;X8c46bc694;X8c94dfde1;X908052d7f;X9177e04ab;X98ab6a994;X9a2a36353;X9af48e66e;Xa150953f6;Xadd704ea2;Xb2db970cc;Xb5a8fdc7c;Xb7411ad18;Xc4b73eef0;Xc78b95f3b;Xc7b9e6e82;Xca51dbd7b;Xccc3dfa0b;Xdc119b9f7;Xe1808c038;Xeabf34e33;Xeb4e74887;Xedba16c92;Xf042c217e;Xf64dee6e4;Xf797a36f3;Xf8f3c184d;Xfa8877b2d;Xfba3d9293;Xff4189165,52,A literature review: What exactly should we preserve?

The fundamental problem for any digital preservation system is that it must be affordable for the long term. To reduce the cost of ownership, the LOCKSS system uses generic PC hardware, open source software, and peer-to-peer technology. It is packaged as a ``network appliance'', a single-function box that can be connected to the Internet, configured and left alone to do its job with minimal monitoring or administration. The first version of this system was based on a Linux boot floppy. After three years of testing it was replaced by a second version, based on OpenBSD and booting from CD-ROM. We focus in this paper on the design, implementation and deployment of a network appliance based on an open source operating system. We provide an overview of the LOCKSS application and describe the experience of deploying and supporting its first version.

Generalized set of measures are also proposed for weighted networks. Our analysis of co-authorship networks dataset suggests significant correlation of our proposed new centrality measures (especially weighted networks) than traditional centrality measures with performance of the scholars.

Current implementations of OAI-PMH are either separate applications that access an existing repository, or are built-in to repository software packages. mod_oai is different in that it optimizes harvesting web content by building OAI-PMH capability into the Apache server.

582,"This paper raises concerns about the advantages of using statistical significance tests in research assessments as has recently been suggested in the debate about proper normalization procedures for citation indicators. Statistical significance tests are highly controversial and numerous criticisms have been leveled against their use. Based on examples from articles by proponents of the use statistical significance tests in research assessments, we address some of the numerous problems with such tests. The issues specifically discussed are the ritual practice of such tests, their dichotomous application in decision making, the difference between statistical and substantive significance, the implausibility of most null hypotheses, the crucial assumption of randomness, as well as the utility of standard errors and confidence intervals for inferential purposes. We argue that applying statistical significance tests and mechanically adhering to their results is highly problematic and detrimental to critical thinking. We claim that the use of such tests do not provide any advantages in relation to citation indicators, interpretations of them, or the decision making processes based upon them. On the contrary their use may be harmful.

We present a criticism of the present mathematical structure of ontologies and indicate that they are not sufficient in their present form to represent the many different valid expressions of a subject knowledge domain. We propose an alternative structure for ontologies based on a richer multi connected complex network which contains the present ontology structure as a projection.

585,"Even though library and archival practice, as well as Digital Preservation, have a long tradition in identifying information objects, the question of their precise identity under change of carrier or migration is still a riddle to science. The objective of this paper is to provide criteria for the unique identification of some important kinds of information objects, independent from the kind of carrier or specific encoding. Our approach is based on the idea that the substance of some kinds of information objects can completely be described in terms of discrete arrangements of finite numbers of known kinds of symbols, such as those implied by style guides for scientific journal submissions. Our theory is also useful for selecting or describing what has to be preserved. This is a fundamental problem since curators and archivists would like to formally record the decisions of what has to be preserved over time and to decide (or verify) whether a migration (transformation) preserves the intended information content. Furthermore, it is important for reasoning about the authenticity of digital objects, as well as for reducing the cost of digital preservation.","Doerr, Martin;Tzitzikas, Yannis",ArXiv e-prints,X046d90d77;X0750a1754;X0ec38f006;X0f9979940;X102ec96c2;X10edc1432;X1192e63fe;X17ddb9c87;X18ae3f349;X19f4e9ff2;X277f935a2;X2af62f837;X2eef5b868;X32a639943;X34a89c37d;X352b259cd;X4041d2a33;X44ac0759a;X486d0bc26;X5247e4d46;X55aa802e2;X57a75ac4f;X5f5bc4b68;X61ddb7529;X62b61cf28;X69096f7df;X73a482b71;X75896f669;X75b6f864d;X7d23368b6;X81599aa66;X8448e9f45;X8568c6f2b;X85e35b299;X88b0b1635;X8d2d73929;X8fb46d38f;X99a650d3a;X99d3bfd3b;Xa1aa41b8b;Xa534601a8;Xa6290a6a8;Xb15fdd631;Xb1959915f;Xb471bfbfe;Xb6f02196f;Xbda490c79;Xbf86a9d71;Xc6e824614;Xcafa32198;Xcb5e04f8f;Xcf850febb;Xcff723c47;Xd510e1da6;Xdbd90a994;Xde971f73f;Xdf18e3753;Xe36068f8c;Xe7db45de5;Xef72873bf;Xf9376cfeb,61,Information Carriers and Identification of Information Objects: An Ontological Approach,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0385,2012

590,"Numerous systems for dissemination, retrieval, and archiving of documents have been developed in the past. Those systems often focus on one of these aspects and are hard to extend and combine. Typically, the transmission protocols, query and filtering languages are fixed as well as the interfaces to other systems. We rather envisage the seamless establishment of networks among the providers, repositories and consumers of information, supporting information retrieval and dissemination while being highly interoperable and extensible. We propose a framework with a single event-based mechanism that unifies document storage, retrieval, and dissemination. This framework offers complete openness with respect to document and metadata formats, transmission protocols, and filtering mechanisms. It specifies a high-level building kit, by which arbitrary processors for document streams can be incorporated to support the retrieval, transformation, aggregation and disaggregation of documents. Using the same kit, interfaces for different transmission protocols can be added easily to enable the communication with various information sources and information consumers.","Faulstich, Lukas C.",ArXiv e-prints,X0f72d3f34;X4a7dffde3,2,The NPC Framework for Building Information Dissemination Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0305010,2003
591,"The concept of h-index has been proposed to easily assess a researcher's performance with a single two-dimensional number. However, by using only this single number, we lose significant information about the distribution of the number of citations per article of an author's publication list. Two authors with the same h-index may have totally different distributions of the number of citations per article. One may have a very long ""tail"" in the citation curve, i.e. he may have published a great number of articles, which did not receive relatively many citations. Another researcher may have a short tail, i.e. almost all his publications got a relatively large number of citations. In this article, we study an author's citation curve and we define some areas appearing in this curve. These areas are used to further evaluate authors' research performance from quantitative and qualitative point of view. We call these areas as ""penalty"" ones, since the greater they are, the more an author's performance is penalized. Moreover, we use these areas to establish new metrics aiming at categorizing researchers in two distinct categories: ""influential"" ones vs. ""mass producers"".","Sidiropoulos, Antonis;Katsaros, Dimitrios;Manolopoulos, Yannis",ArXiv e-prints,X4390dead2;Xa812de039,2,Categorizing Influential Authors Using Penalty Areas,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0277,2013

These are minor issues that are easily amended and should be corrected, but more substantive improvements are needed.

594,"Nowadays folksonomy tags are used not just for personal organization, but for communication and sharing between people sharing their own local interests. In this paper is considered the new concept structure called ""Folksodriven"" to represent folksonomies. The Folksodriven Structure Network (FSN) was thought as folksonomy tags suggestions for the user on a dataset built on chosen websites - based on Natural Language Processing (NLP). Morphological changes, such as changes in folksonomy tags chose have direct impact on network connectivity (structural plasticity) of the folksonomy tags considered. The goal of this paper is on defining a base for a FSN plasticity theory to analyze. To perform such goal it is necessary a systematic mathematical analysis on deformation and fracture for the ontology matching on the FSN. The advantages of that approach could be used on a new interesting method to be employed by a knowledge management system.","Dal Mas, Massimiliano",ArXiv e-prints,X399a1a64d;X4bc8eb6a3;X5efd72bf7;X6d378154f;X7a62fa141;Xd945e6bda,6,Elasticity on Ontology Matching of Folksodriven Structure Network,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3900,2012
595,"Researchers' networks have been subject to active modeling and analysis. Earlier literature mostly focused on citation or co-authorship networks reconstructed from annotated scientific publication databases, which have several limitations. Recently, general-purpose web search engines have also been utilized to collect information about social networks. Here we reconstructed, using web search engines, a network representing the relatedness of researchers to their peers as well as to various research topics. Relatedness between researchers and research topics was characterized by visibility boost-increase of a researcher's visibility by focusing on a particular topic. It was observed that researchers who had high visibility boosts by the same research topic tended to be close to each other in their network. We calculated correlations between visibility boosts by research topics and researchers' interdisciplinarity at individual level (diversity of topics related to the researcher) and at social level (his/her centrality in the researchers' network). We found that visibility boosts by certain research topics were positively correlated with researchers' individual-level interdisciplinarity despite their negative correlations with the general popularity of researchers. It was also found that visibility boosts by network-related topics had positive correlations with researchers' social-level interdisciplinarity. Research topics' correlations with researchers' individual- and social-level interdisciplinarities were found to be nearly independent from each other. These findings suggest that the notion of ""interdisciplinarity"" of a researcher should be understood as a multi-dimensional concept that should be evaluated using multiple assessment means.","Sayama, Hiroki;Akaishi, Jin",PLoS ONE,X0f44bc9e9;X20341700b;X20c27246b;X3a0b664b9;X4174624ff;X7793f5670;X998e2ac96;Xbfe9fc370;Xc44b60135;Xc838013d7;Xdd1724c41;Xdd7cccfc5;Xdf74945a9;Xe1871736f;Xe8d228f40,15,Characterizing Interdisciplinarity of Researchers and Research Topics Using Web Search Engines,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3592,2012

597,"Journal Impact Factors (IFs) can be considered historically as the first attempt to normalize citation distributions by using averages over two years. However, it has been recognized that citation distributions vary among fields of science and that one needs to normalize for this. Furthermore, the mean-or any central-tendency statistics-is not a good representation of the citation distribution because these distributions are skewed. Important steps have been taken to solve these two problems during the last few years. First, one can normalize at the article level using the citing audience as the reference set. Second, one can use non-parametric statistics for testing the significance of differences among ratings. A proportion of most-highly cited papers (the top-10% or top-quartile) on the basis of fractional counting of the citations may provide an alternative to the current IF. This indicator is intuitively simple, allows for statistical testing, and accords with the state of the art.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X00c90a220;X09cdef349;X0f6feb660;X122976229;X1d63dc065;X2c000d5a5;X32e60efd6;X367c94d05;X3e11b0f57;X4289968c4;X441072106;X455e60b5b;X460bbf60b;X4788a0bec;X556f0fb5e;X55d5d7546;X57d30f73a;X5ac216cc7;X5f257accd;X610ec9b63;X62ff47498;X6680c722d;X6c1955199;X7846e7752;X785293c8e;X787109b84;X7afe67e9a;X7fd738126;X902ddd8dc;X9085a235c;X90c45aa1c;X90c95b3e0;X91d425a96;X9345e9a7a;X9fc6dbf74;Xaa5bd543b;Xab985ac77;Xb9ee22039;Xba05e6744;Xbf0a140ab;Xcb2d93431;Xcbd0f3bed;Xdcf416fae;Xdd31eec98;Xe02d5bfea;Xf08f82f22;Xf7727a17e;Xfec3a4f62,48,Alternatives to the Journal Impact Factor: I3 and the Top-10% (or Top-25%?) of the Most-Highly Cited Papers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4638,2012
598,"A new size-independent indicator of scientific journal prestige, the SJR2 indicator, is proposed. This indicator takes into account not only the prestige of the citing scientific journal but also its closeness to the cited journal using the cosine of the angle between the vectors of the two journals' cocitation profiles. To eliminate the size effect, the accumulated prestige is divided by the fraction of the journal's citable documents, thus eliminating the decreasing tendency of this type of indicator and giving meaning to the scores. Its method of computation is described, and the results of its implementation on the Scopus 2008 dataset is compared with those of an ad hoc Journal Impact Factor, JIF(3y), and SNIP, the comparison being made both overall and within specific scientific areas. All three, the SJR2 indicator, the SNIP indicator and the JIF distributions, were found to fit well to a logarithmic law. Although the three metrics were strongly correlated, there were major changes in rank. In addition, the SJR2 was distributed more equalized than the JIF by Subject Area and almost as equalized as the SNIP, and better than both at the lower level of Specific Subject Areas. The incorporation of the cosine increased the values of the flows of prestige between thematically close journals.","Guerrero-Bote, Vicente P.;Moya-Anegon, Felix",ArXiv e-prints,X00de94f78;X07ee741e5;X11245887e;X14c3bbafc;X17f1b0aac;X1b0ffdc30;X28777409e;X2b332b0af;X2ef8a4546;X35f3a35d3;X3762a024e;X37c0478e5;X40319a188;X41cff3324;X4c1a43591;X4f80ce540;X50951a280;X50dbc3edc;X514c609e0;X52521983c;X57bd0c214;X596e03de1;X5d5afa4cb;X67aaeda4d;X68881de33;X73f4a0f7e;X7a5892a2f;X7e4c72244;X81487936b;X867c20545;X940ecc0bf;X96586789a;X9675423d5;X9a2f14982;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa9ade2334;Xaa574e56c;Xac8f1a897;Xbc5288f98;Xc8730bab1;Xccdcaf6c4;Xcd98e4fbe;Xd016edce6;Xdbc81cbd7;Xdbeca5a23;Xde895c26a;Xe1c3a1db7;Xe3276e208;Xec23f4fe0;Xf7af34b12;Xf921a0212;Xff2ef5e71,53,A further step forward in measuring journals' scientific prestige: The SJR2 indicator,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4639,2012

The process of digitizing the contents of the UQ Flint Archive provides a number of interesting challenges in the context of EMELD. Firstly, all of the linguistic data is for languages which are either endangered or extinct, and as such forms a valuable ethnographic repository. Secondly, the physical format of the data is itself in danger of decline, and as such digitization is an important preservation task in the short to medium term. Thirdly, the adoption of open standards for the encoding and presentation of text and audio data for linguistic field data, whilst enabling preservation, represents a new field of research in itself where best practice has yet to be formalised. Fourthly, the provision of this linguistic data online as a new data source for future research introduces concerns of data portability and longevity. This paper will outline the origins of the data model, the content creation components, presentation forms based on the data model, data capture tools and media conversion components.

From the perspective of reverse engineering research, open data is a new artifact that serves as input for reverse engineering techniques and processes. Specific challenges of open data are document scraping, image processing, and structure/schema recognition. From the perspective of maintenance research, maintenance has to accommodate changes of open data sources by third-party providers, traceability of data transformation pipelines, and quality assurance of data and transformations. We believe that the increasing importance of open data and the research challenges that it brings with it may possibly lead to the emergence of new research streams for reverse engineering as well as for maintenance.","Kienle, Holger M.",ArXiv e-prints,X2534c7fe9;X63e50cda5;X7793f5670;X80ca3c1df;Xa679545e0;Xa76d8b9be;Xc0b10d8fe;Xc730f259e;Xd96e4bace,9,Open Data: Reverse Engineering and Maintenance Perspective,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1656,2012
609,"In August 2011, Thomson Reuters launched version 5 of the Science and Social Science Citation Index in the Web of Science (WoS). Among other things, the 222 ISI Subject Categories (SCs) for these two databases in version 4 of WoS were renamed and extended to 225 WoS Categories (WCs). A new set of 151 Subject Categories (SCs) was added, but at a higher level of aggregation. Since we previously used the ISI SCs as the baseline for a global map in Pajek (Rafols et al., 2010) and brought this facility online (at http://www.leydesdorff.net/overlaytoolkit), we recalibrated this map for the new WC categories using the Journal Citation Reports 2010.

611,"Literary works reference a variety of globally shared themes including well-known people, events, and time periods. It is particularly interesting to locate patterns that are either invariant across time or exhibit a characteristic change across time, as they could imply something important about society that those works record. This paper suggests the use of Google n-gram viewer as a fast prototyping method for examining time-based properties over a rich sample of literary prose. Using this method, we find that some repeating periods of time, like Sunday, are referenced disproportionally, allowing us to pose questions such as why a day like Thursday is so unpopular. Furthermore, by treating software as a work of prose, we can apply a similar analysis to open-source software repositories and explore time-based relations in commit logs. Doing a simple statistical analysis on a few temporal keywords in the log records, we reinforce and weaken a few beliefs on how college students approach open source software. Finally, we help readers working on their own temporal analysis by comparing the fundamental differences between literary works and code repositories, and suggest blog or wiki as recently-emerging works.","Michalski, Brian;Krishnamoorthy, Mukkai;Lau, Tsz-Yam",ArXiv e-prints,X04effcad4;X08afa7dc4;X554a8be55;X688eef611;X75ea0dbff;X785816b7e,6,Temporal Analysis of Literary and Programming Prose,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2131,2012
612,"We analyze the online response to the preprint publication of a cohort of 4,606 scientific articles submitted to the preprint database arXiv.org between October 2010 and May 2011. We study three forms of responses to these preprints: downloads on the arXiv.org site, mentions on the social media site Twitter, and early citations in the scholarly record. We perform two analyses. First, we analyze the delay and time span of article downloads and Twitter mentions following submission, to understand the temporal configuration of these reactions and whether one precedes or follows the other. Second, we run regression and correlation tests to investigate the relationship between Twitter mentions, arXiv downloads and article citations. We find that Twitter mentions and arXiv downloads of scholarly articles follow two distinct temporal patterns of activity, with Twitter mentions having shorter delays and narrower time spans than arXiv downloads. We also find that the volume of Twitter mentions is statistically correlated with arXiv downloads and early citations just months after the publication of a preprint, with a possible bias that favors highly mentioned articles.","Shuai, Xin;Pepe, Alberto;Bollen, Johan",PLoS ONE,X019187be8;X03ab63edf;X07c20c0b2;X0a6a434ae;X111b6ea9c;X120139485;X194b4be47;X1e63d0448;X26460c121;X2abb24e41;X2e6dbbf4d;X2f030e53d;X32be3589f;X348814447;X354db9643;X382822196;X3905a54e5;X39fed1fbb;X3a0b664b9;X3c9a989d1;X3da6d53b9;X46c2dabf1;X47d924911;X48375e042;X4c1b6d5d2;X4e8e18df2;X527d043c7;X53eac5568;X54dbaa628;X54f74b5e9;X56e623a3a;X5a32fd1f5;X5c0dadf73;X5cf3075f7;X5d2f1264f;X5dcee7c04;X62eb39506;X6478380ac;X65a7634ff;X6974142b8;X69be65931;X6bbae3dfc;X6c74a1aa2;X7549f250d;X794311564;X812bc3182;X8249adb30;X82b0904d4;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X89a199d97;X8b409f409;X8c8a8a4fa;X9156758d1;X959cd01d6;X97da6a7fd;X9b760a2b2;Xa1b994b71;Xa6266646e;Xafc83bd12;Xb0ae097b3;Xb0b6151d7;Xb1875d7bd;Xb2b7c0106;Xb30b32c13;Xb76224a04;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbb584e8e7;Xbfa188013;Xc0fb04d69;Xc1e1f64de;Xd011d9c1b;Xd1b83a917;Xd6590031f;Xda7b026af;Xe35ed2fad;Xe5283b6b2;Xea0c1a83b;Xec86bbc09;Xed54abb40;Xf2b6a4598;Xf373ea5a6;Xf3b223276;Xf5869ff18;Xfdfd30183;Xfe02ef20c,87,"How the Scientific Community Reacts to Newly Submitted Preprints: Article Downloads, Twitter Mentions, and Citations",http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2461,2012
613,"As the usage of 3D models increases, so does the importance of developing accurate 3D shape retrieval algorithms. A common approach is to calculate a shape descriptor for each object, which can then be compared to determine two objects' similarity. However, these descriptors are often evaluated independently and on different datasets, making them difficult to compare. Using the SHREC 2011 Shape Retrieval Contest of Non-rigid 3D Watertight Meshes dataset, we systematically evaluate a collection of local shape descriptors. We apply each descriptor to the bag-of-words paradigm and assess the effects of varying the dictionary's size and the number of sample points. In addition, several salient point detection methods are used to choose sample points; these methods are compared to each other and to random selection. Finally, information from two local descriptors is combined in two ways and changes in performance are investigated. This paper presents results of these experiments.","Tang, Sarah;Godil, Afzal",Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Conference Series,X00077932b;X005a2fe25;X00d5cabcd;X0d1d9b7f5;X0ed475d6f;X13b7bcb39;X13ea1d266;X170eb5603;X1ae522ecd;X1bae54b04;X1e78960c0;X20f156d08;X211d0e6fb;X249f7683e;X28a621c4e;X2aa1940a4;X313286848;X32f76bad5;X356b58f14;X378a992f1;X38e768e97;X3c1ad2d3a;X3de20c951;X3df7f092a;X3e5ee72ad;X4401b1f98;X482a01182;X48a3aaa9b;X4e3fa00bc;X54f286f87;X55d311045;X56ed81b0d;X56f3eca05;X5722f35eb;X58c5063f1;X59dde7468;X61bcdd279;X68b930ef2;X6918db166;X696daaa44;X6ab4e099f;X6cedd1473;X708565da1;X716ec96de;X75dc0e9e9;X762bf8f2d;X78c4096f4;X7dfc57cf7;X8436ed371;X854b3ab40;X8aae85590;X8ce49a48b;X8e5091779;X900d1dc30;X93b6a22b5;X96a215fe3;X96b429fac;X9725e4733;X97310de15;Xa02827b36;Xa895b1906;Xa9b7c866c;Xae707a468;Xaf4bd59a7;Xaff0fd9e3;Xb90470f71;Xba7d1eb6b;Xbc12bd357;Xbc4aadf06;Xbe13c4dc5;Xbf9193be9;Xc02f13efb;Xc824e284a;Xc8d19d32c;Xc9065b5bf;Xcc825d0cc;Xd315d97d7;Xd3978b260;Xd79292933;Xd8dbf293b;Xd95e630bd;Xd9d65d6f8;Xe0d3950b6;Xe4c270873;Xe675d0f1d;Xeb448e8e0;Xeba9d18f9;Xf100907c2;Xf53cd25c3;Xf92ca56af;Xfa886f269;Xfc6901f1b;Xfc90868f2;Xfdf5b26a1,94,An evaluation of local shape descriptors for 3D shape retrieval,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2368,2012

Its governance infrastructure addresses problems of resource creation by providing a mechanism through which the language-resource community can express its consensus on recommended best practices.","Simons, Gary;Bird, Steven",ArXiv e-prints,X10b555c9c;X17037642f;X4af309cf2;X62fd69fba;X700cd4198;X7285dcd6b;X734bbb6a8;X7de1b3f2c;X824cf029d;X854be897d;X8fc81ce0a;X9e1f0039d;X9e7ea94af;Xadd66b30a;Xc5302f40d;Xc78b95f3b;Xe17302de5;Xe36e5e5fb;Xf260918f1;Xf9cd326ea,20,The Open Language Archives Community: An infrastructure for distributed archiving of language resources,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0306040,2003
619,"It is shown that under certain circumstances in particular for small datasets the recently proposed citation impact indicators I3(6PR) and R(6,k) behave inconsistently when additional papers or citations are taken into consideration. Three simple examples are presented, in which the indicators fluctuate strongly and the ranking of scientists in the evaluated group is sometimes completely mixed up by minor changes in the data base. The erratic behavior is traced to the specific way in which weights are attributed to the six percentile rank classes, specifically for the tied papers. For 100 percentile rank classes the effects will be less serious. For the 6 classes it is demonstrated that a different way of assigning weights avoids these problems, although the non-linearity of the weights for the different percentile rank classes can still lead to (much less frequent) changes in the ranking. This behavior is not undesired, because it can be used to correct for differences in citation behavior in different fields. Remaining deviations from the theoretical value R(6,k) = 1.91 can be avoided by a new scoring rule, the fractional scoring. Previously proposed consistency criteria are amended by another property of strict independence which a performance indicator should aim at.","Schreiber, Michael",ArXiv e-prints,X25db0ffdc;X56eb90aab;X7aae53e56;X8b402a927;X959cd01d6;Xe35ed2fad,6,Inconsistencies of Recently Proposed Citation Impact Indicators and how to Avoid Them,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3861,2012
620,"The Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 is a ranking of universities based on bibliometric indicators of publication output, citation impact, and scientific collaboration. The ranking includes 500 major universities from 41 different countries. This paper provides an extensive discussion of the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012. The ranking is compared with other global university rankings, in particular the Academic Ranking of World Universities (commonly known as the Shanghai Ranking) and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. Also, a detailed description is offered of the data collection methodology of the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 and of the indicators used in the ranking. Various innovations in the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 are presented. These innovations include (1) an indicator based on counting a university's highly cited publications, (2) indicators based on fractional rather than full counting of collaborative publications, (3) the possibility of excluding non-English language publications, and (4) the use of stability intervals. Finally, some comments are made on the interpretation of the ranking, and a number of limitations of the ranking are pointed out.","Waltman, Ludo;Calero-Medina, Clara;Kosten, Joost;Noyons, Ed C.

This research presents a taxonomy of contractual and technical restrictions applicable to databases in life science. It builds upon research led by Science Commons demonstrating why open data and the freedom to integrate facilitate innovation and how this openness can be achieved. The taxonomy describes technical and legal restrictions applicable to life science databases, and its metadata have been used to assess terms of use of databases hosted by Life Science Resource Name (LSRN) Schema. While a few public domain policies are standardized, most terms of use are not harmonized, difficult to understand and impose controls that prevent others from effectively reusing data. Identifying a small number of restrictions allows one to quickly appreciate which databases are open.

We additionally present a somewhat more inclusive analysis, applicable for many early-career researchers, that is based on publications from 2006-2010. Histograms and percentiles, plus top-performer lists, are presented for each category.

For this we use the Thomson Reuters' Book Citation Index, a novel multidisciplinary database launched in 2010 which offers bibliometric data of books. We analyze three possible factors which are considered to affect the citation impact of books: the presence of editors, the inclusion in series and the type of publisher. Also, we focus on highly cited books to see if these factors may affect them as well. We considered as highly cited books, those in the top 5% of the most highly cited ones of the database. We define these three aspects and we present the results for four major scientific areas in order to identify field-based differences (Science, Engineering & Technology, Social Sciences and Arts & Humanities). Finally we conclude observing that differences were noted for edited books and types of publishers.

627,"Social tagging has become an interesting approach to improve search and navigation over the actual Web, since it aggregates the tags added by different users to the same resource in a collaborative way. This way, it results in a list of weighted tags describing its resource. Combined to a classical taxonomic classification system such as that by Wikipedia, social tags can enhance document navigation and search. On the one hand, social tags suggest alternative navigation ways, including pivot-browsing, popularity-driven navigation, and filtering. On the other hand, it provides new metadata, sometimes uncovered by documents' content, that can substantially improve document search. In this work, the inclusion of an interface to add user-defined tags describing Wikipedia articles is proposed, as a way to improve article navigation and retrieval.

Little is known about the effect of settings on folksonomies created on social tagging systems. In this work, we consider the settings of social tagging systems to further understand tag distributions in folksonomies. We analyze in depth the tag distributions on three large-scale social tagging datasets, and analyze the effect on a resource classification task. To this end, we study the appropriateness of applying weighting schemes based on the well-known TF-IDF for resource classification. We show the great importance of settings as to altering tag distributions. Among those settings, tag suggestions produce very different folksonomies, which condition the success of the employed weighting schemes.

Here we make use of this data by investigating fluctuations in yearly usage frequencies of specific words that describe social and natural phenomena, as derived from books that were published over the course of the past two centuries. We show that the determination of the Hurst parameter by means of fractal analysis provides fundamental insights into the nature of long-range correlations contained in the culturomic trajectories, and by doing so, offers new interpretations as to what might be the main driving forces behind the examined phenomena. Quite remarkably, we find that social and natural phenomena are governed by fundamentally different processes.

635,"The process of innovation follows non-linear patterns across the domains of science, technology, and the economy. Novel bibliometric mapping techniques can be used to investigate and represent distinctive, but complementary perspectives on the innovation process (e.g., ""demand"" and ""supply"") as well as the interactions among these perspectives. The perspectives can be represented as ""continents"" of data related to varying extents over time. For example, the different branches of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) in the Medline database provide sources of such perspectives (e.g., ""Diseases"" versus ""Drugs and Chemicals""). The multiple-perspective approach enables us to reconstruct facets of the dynamics of innovation, in terms of selection mechanisms shaping localizable trajectories and/or resulting in more globalized regimes. By expanding the data with patents and scholarly publications, we demonstrate the use of this multi-perspective approach in the case of RNA Interference (RNAi).

636,"Classifying journals or publications into research areas is an essential element of many bibliometric analyses. Classification usually takes place at the level of journals, where the Web of Science subject categories are the most popular classification system. However, journal-level classification systems have two important limitations: They offer only a limited amount of detail, and they have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals. To avoid these limitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification systems at the level of individual publications. In the proposed methodology, publications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations. The methodology is able to deal with very large numbers of publications. We present an application in which a classification system is produced that includes almost ten million publications. Based on an extensive analysis of this classification system, we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the proposed methodology. Important strengths are the transparency and relative simplicity of the methodology and its fairly modest computing and memory requirements. The main limitation of the methodology is its exclusive reliance on direct citation relations between publications. The accuracy of the methodology can probably be increased by also taking into account other types of relations, for instance based on bibliographic coupling.","Waltman, Ludo;van Eck, Nees Jan",ArXiv e-prints,X05f36dab7;X07ff8fc6a;X0915b284c;X0954e8445;X0d7424392;X0ea2393f3;X104391f8f;X10f7d4ad6;X14b5ba16b;X186a23d8d;X1a05cbd44;X202de545a;X22d87b2e5;X291b37472;X2b2544bd2;X2bb8a0209;X2cefb2b7b;X2f609a58e;X33a8a114c;X341d9b3c3;X35e98ecec;X378a992f1;X4973137d1;X55ff57b1c;X5662cceb3;X58cee9e89;X6520d43bd;X6875f9dea;X69ddbf8c8;X6d4c92640;X6fe3a1837;X72ec75493;X7484c5499;X78dca00ea;X7e04b9b30;X7e9a514c5;X805c3bd3d;X80890207d;X921d16293;X96c672bd5;X977da8f8c;X9e6f63a7e;Xa1b994b71;Xa77eb184b;Xa7b3e1417;Xa83771264;Xa9760fdb7;Xaa9b33ffb;Xad11c1fd8;Xadbe8da8f;Xb207c6ed4;Xb8e366410;Xc07345d23;Xc6aa89e4f;Xcd40f8237;Xda84e5ed1;Xdbaf7f5c0;Xdea020f9a;Xe11fa1858;Xeab43ed0e;Xeb1104e88;Xf8663f239,62,A new methodology for constructing a publication-level classification system of science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532,2012
637,"Wikipedia, as a social phenomenon of collaborative knowledge creating, has been studied extensively from various points of views. The category system of Wikipedia, introduced in 2004, has attracted relatively little attention. In this study, we focus on the documentation of knowledge, and the transformation of this documentation with time. We take Wikipedia as a proxy for knowledge in general and its category system as an aspect of the structure of this knowledge. We investigate the evolution of the category structure of the English Wikipedia from its birth in 2004 to 2008. We treat the category system as if it is a hierarchical Knowledge Organization System, capturing the changes in the distributions of the top categories. We investigate how the clustering of articles, defined by the category system, matches the direct link network between the articles and show how it changes over time. We find the Wikipedia category network mostly stable, but with occasional reorganization. We show that the clustering matches the link structure quite well, except short periods preceding the reorganizations.","Suchecki, Krzysztof;Almila Akdag Salah, Alkim;Gao, Cheng;Scharnhorst, Andrea",ArXiv e-prints,X004ad1a04;X00e22d239;X078f2ae65;X07c4ec776;X0c57a0b55;X0f3a1b64f;X1cdbcc157;X203281d33;X21752ef44;X22ea7a542;X296881d7c;X3387e1cd5;X35676912a;X3cb59f1d1;X3d9c806b5;X3dd3530fc;X3f11b4b17;X42ef7d1d9;X48dfa024d;X4dad780e1;X5095ef3e9;X50c225c0c;X5e035ff9f;X63ae6f35e;X6669d8333;X6b0f48301;X74cb266b9;X785816b7e;X7afc46efe;X7b73b16d9;X7c39ce6ad;X7e35657d7;X8a44aeb34;X8f546fb94;X904ac8e91;X907dc6d0e;X99a630e3e;Xa1b994b71;Xa41b998da;Xa474af38a;Xaa669a65d;Xac89609e0;Xb119673ed;Xb16870934;Xb47d965e5;Xb50e05f0b;Xb603be461;Xb7fbb34fb;Xb94c1408d;Xc0975f32d;Xc44305b06;Xc48857054;Xceaac6f6b;Xd17bfe87b;Xd9a0fe1c2;Xdf142d981;Xe187ee7ad;Xe9b4abf87;Xeec41d310;Xff4433f54;Xff7644c06,61,Evolution of Wikipedia's Category Structure,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0788,2012

To this end, we first analyze the Medline database, the MeSH index tree, and the various options for a static mapping from different perspectives and at different levels of aggregation. Following a specific innovation (RNA interference) over time, the notion of a trajectory which leaves a signature in the database is elaborated.

640,"In bibliometrics, the association of ""impact"" with central-tendency statistics is mistaken. Impacts add up, and citation curves should therefore be integrated instead of averaged. For example, the journals MIS Quarterly and JASIST differ by a factor of two in terms of their respective impact factors (IF), but the journal with the lower IF has the higher impact. Using percentile ranks (e.g., top-1%, top-10%, etc.), an integrated impact indicator (I3) can be based on integration of the citation curves, but after normalization of the citation curves to the same scale. The results across document sets can be compared as percentages of the total impact of a reference set. Total number of citations, however, should not be used instead because the shape of the citation curves is then not appreciated. I3 can be applied to any document set and any citation window. The results of the integration (summation) are fully decomposable in terms of journals or instititutional units such as nations, universities, etc., because percentile ranks are determined at the paper level. In this study, we first compare I3 with IFs for the journals in two ISI Subject Categories (""Information Science & Library Science"" and ""Multidisciplinary Sciences""). The LIS set is additionally decomposed in terms of nations. Policy implications of this possible paradigm shift in citation impact analysis are specified.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X07bbe0aa2;X0ab4af66c;X178acc0e6;X1ef62ff24;X258880bdd;X25db0ffdc;X2698f3b0f;X2701bba87;X296069160;X3a9f4a95c;X4c09afa8d;X53ae7d376;X55d335871;X562e9f36f;X6b3c8844e;X6e9f4e59d;X6fb32d141;X8a224ed34;X920773f55;X9b057c1c4;X9b1fc97fd;Xa0ef06452;Xa1b994b71;Xa480a0a41;Xa4b2d298d;Xb0b6151d7;Xb293245bc;Xb3510f4e7;Xb50e05f0b;Xbba7e7fde;Xbc812f58f;Xbd3d1f502;Xc45af37fc;Xdd31eec98;Xe3161a01d;Xeba5f100f;Xee0a65279;Xf0327120d;Xf4ac37371;Xffdab3948,40,Integrated Impact Indicators (I3) compared with Impact Factors (IFs): An alternative research design with policy implications,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5241,2011
641,"Purpose: Social Media Tools (SMT) have provided new opportunities for libraries and librarians in the world. In academic libraries, we can use of them as a powerful tool for communication. This study is to determine the use of the social interactive media tools [Social Networking Tools (SNT), Social Bookmarking Tools (SBT), Image or Video Sharing Tools (IVShT), and Mashup Tools (MT)] in disseminating knowledge and information among librarians in the Limerick University, Ireland. Methodology: The study was a descriptive survey. The research population included all librarians in Glucksman library. A questionnaire survey was done to collect data. Statistical software, SPSS16 was used at two levels (descriptive and inferential statistics) for data analyzing. Findings: The findings show that the mean (out of 5.00) of using each of SMT in sharing knowledge by the librarians of Glucksman library is as the following: SNT (2.49), SBT (2.92), IVShT (2.99) and MT (2.5). It shows that most of their interaction related to share of image or video. Originality: SMT provides an excellent platform for the exchange information between students, faculty members, and the librarians themselves. The Glucksman library at the University of Limerick is using this technology. This paper gives an example of how using these tools in the field of Library and Information Science in Ireland.

642,"Complex scientific codes and the datasets they generate are in need of a sophisticated categorization environment that allows the community to store, search, and enhance metadata in an open, dynamic system. Currently, data is often presented in a read-only format, distilled and curated by a select group of researchers. We envision a more open and dynamic system, where authors can publish their data in a writeable format, allowing users to annotate the datasets with their own comments and data. This would enable the scientific community to collaborate on a higher level than before, where researchers could for example annotate a published dataset with their citations. Such a system would require a complete set of permissions to ensure that any individual's data cannot be altered by others unless they specifically allow it. For this reason datasets and codes are generally presented read-only, to protect the author's data; however, this also prevents the type of social revolutions that the private sector has seen with Facebook and Twitter. In this paper, we present an alternative method of publishing codes and datasets, based on Fluidinfo, which is an openly writeable and social metadata engine. We will use the specific example of the Einstein Toolkit, a shared scientific code built using the Cactus Framework, to illustrate how the code's metadata may be published in writeable form via Fluidinfo.","Seidel, Eric L.",ArXiv e-prints,552dd6a56c;X1923b61c0;X19c910d71;X1a0d3fca8;X3daeafa14;X4157e801c;X64d4f135e;X691f91eba;X8a1156c74;X9f9566c45;Xa651fe34e;Xccc23c93f;Xd8cc67ee2;Xe086d5bb1,14,Metadata Management in Scientific Computing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4135,2012

The unit of analysis is the geographical distance between those cities. In our macro-level trend analysis, covering the years 2000-2010, we observe that research collaboration distances have been increasing, while the share of collaborative contacts with foreign cities has leveled off. Collaboration distances and growth rates differ significantly between countries and between fields of science.

In this article, we examine a corpus of scientific abstracts and three forms of associated reactions: article downloads, citations, and bookmarks.

This study explores the properties of these social media-based metrics or ""altmetrics"", sampling 24,331 articles published by the Public Library of Science. We find that that different indicators vary greatly in activity. Around 5% of sampled articles are cited in Wikipedia, while close to 80% have been included in at least one Mendeley library. There is, however, an encouraging diversity; a quarter of articles have nonzero data from five or more different sources. Correlation and factor analysis suggest citation and altmetrics indicators track related but distinct impacts, with neither able to describe the complete picture of scholarly use alone. There are moderate correlations between Mendeley and Web of Science citation, but many altmetric indicators seem to measure impact mostly orthogonal to citation. Articles cluster in ways that suggest five different impact ""flavors"", capturing impacts of different types on different audiences; for instance, some articles may be heavily read and saved by scholars but seldom cited. Together, these findings encourage more research into altmetrics as complements to traditional citation measures.","Priem, Jason;Piwowar, Heather A.;Hemminger, Bradley M.",ArXiv

650,"There is an overall perception of increased interdisciplinarity in science, but this is difficult to confirm quantitatively owing to the lack of adequate methods to evaluate subjective phenomena. This is no different from the difficulties in establishing quantitative relationships in human and social sciences. In this paper we quantified the interdisciplinarity of scientific journals and science fields by using an entropy measurement based on the diversity of the subject categories of journals citing a specific journal. The methodology consisted in building citation networks using the Journal Citation Reports database, in which the nodes were journals and edges were established based on citations among journals. The overall network for the 11-year period (1999-2009) studied was small-world and scale free with regard to the in-strength. Upon visualizing the network topology an overall structure of the various science fields could be inferred, especially their interconnections. We confirmed quantitatively that science fields are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, with the degree of interdisplinarity (i.e. entropy) correlating strongly with the in-strength of journals and with the impact factor.","Nascimento Silva, Filipi;Aparecido Rodrigues, Francisco;Novais de Oliveira Junior, Osvaldo;da Fontoura Costa, Luciano",ArXiv e-prints,X0659f63c5;X0f026462b;X112745c64;X2abb24e41;X4c68c80c5;X68e4189dc;X91e2f3d93;X93199029f;Xadb3777fb;Xdcdcdea5f;Xe8d826339;Xeb448e8e0;Xff65d4c87,13,Quantifying the interdisciplinarity of scientific journals and fields,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4807,2012
651,"This study examines long-term trends and shifting behavior in the collaboration network of mathematics literature, using a subset of data from Mathematical Reviews spanning 1985-2009. Rather than modeling the network cumulatively, this study traces the evolution of the ""here and now"" using fixed-duration sliding windows. The analysis uses a suite of common network diagnostics, including the distributions of degrees, distances, and clustering, to track network structure. Several random models that call these diagnostics as parameters help tease them apart as factors from the values of others. Some behaviors are consistent over the entire interval, but most diagnostics indicate that the network's structural evolution is dominated by occasional dramatic shifts in otherwise steady trends. These behaviors are not distributed evenly across the network; stark differences in evolution can be observed between two major subnetworks, loosely thought of as ""pure"" and ""applied"", which approximately partition the aggregate. The paper characterizes two major events along the mathematics network trajectory and discusses possible explanatory factors.","Cory Brunson, Jason;Fassino, Steve;McInnes, Antonio;Narayan, Monisha;Richardson, Brianna;Franck, Christopher;Ion, Patrick;Laubenbacher, Reinhard",ArXiv e-prints,X01b004839;X048cf5808;X0aae3c331;X0b559beb5;X0d01666b0;X0d358c729;X0f17f1e6d;X14d793dc8;X22013b6dd;X228c4fc4b;X2acd8c062;X2d5ac6208;X32947bf4d;X33218a7e7;X39dfe0f6d;X3a1b35a3b;X3aacee174;X400f76d42;X4053828c2;X408bc509f;X417033711;X44524c5f0;X46be42b82;X46de5627c;X47d37ebc6;X491d70893;X493f8fd67;X4ab040308;X4e640ce8b;X4fde555ef;X549e8a565;X557f541cf;X5a3e2ca22;X5a55d35f2;X5c1696485;X606fa7fcc;X6106c105c;X64e6f2232;X65a764c98;X6922c1e2c;X6caae00cb;X7167c077d;X7199be483;X74a7aae1d;X751078d5e;X75fa94740;X77310f6d3;X7d5db3d35;X82690b573;X82f52bb9f;X86f68d0a4;X8b6157898;X8fa4ddfe4;X8fc8408bc;X91ac56412;X96c5a22ea;X9719e8bce;X9772d2f37;X9827d7f9c;X98715b6eb;X98fe88b85;X9a4cf8465;X9dfd71579;X9f57f05fb;Xa27d9952b;Xa927e9c6c;Xab0cd1eb0;Xab3a93e60;Xb0ce063f5;Xb32b84ef2;Xb4136d9e2;Xb5efef355;Xc069f6bff;Xc20340ad2;Xc3a0bf178;Xc4e40cc39;Xc9ef28da7;Xccc668e15;Xd0a69351e;Xd28120cd8;Xd2aee4a34;Xd48fa6f57;Xd6a71279c;Xd8c8cbcfa;Xdae5e9766;Xde0c69f86;Xe20a4eac8;Xe240c0e5d;Xe2cca337f;Xe4d28beb1;Xe6c5caa94;Xe998a58d5;Xf8af9a9db;Xfb62a6e93;Xfde6e028b;Xff3bd7e80,96,Evolutionary Events in a Mathematical Sciences Research Collaboration Network,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5158,2012
652,"The problem that the same information need can be expressed in a variety of ways is especially true for scientific literature. Each scientific discipline has its own domain-specific language and vocabulary. This language is coded into documentary tools like thesauri or classifications that are used to document and describe scientific documents. When we think of information retrieval as ""fundamentally a linguistic process"" (Blair, 2003) users have to be aware of the most relevant search terms - which are the controlled thesauri terms the documents are described with. This can be achieved with so-called search-term-recommenders (STR) that map free search terms of a lay user to controlled vocabulary terms which can then be used as a term suggestion or to do an automatic query expansion (Hienert, Schaer, Schaible, & Mayr, 2011). State-of-the-art repository software systems like DSpace or EPrints already offer some kind of term suggestion features in search or input forms but these implementations only work as simple auto completion mechanisms that don't incorporate any kind of semantic mapping. Such software systems would gain a lot in terms of usability and data consistency if tools like the proposed domain-specific STRs would be freely available. We aim to implement a rich toolbox of web services (like the mentioned domain-specific STRs) to support users and providers of online Digital Library (DL) or repository systems.","Schaer, Philipp;Lüke, Thomas;van Hoek, Wilko",ArXiv e-prints,X2abe57279;X2efb5ff29;X4327c26be;X7188a8017;X8103674a5;X911760f4f;X967f04c7d;Xa02827b36;Xb25684d38;Xcc3842ec5;Xd9d65d6f8;Xfdea7d14b,12,Building Custom Term Suggestion Web Services with OAI-Harvested Open Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5689,2012

In this paper we present an hybrid recommendation system to help readers decide which book to read next. We study book and author recommendation in an hybrid recommendation setting and test our approach in the LitRec data set. Our hybrid book recommendation approach purposed combines two item-based collaborative filtering algorithms to predict books and authors that the user will like. Author predictions are expanded in to a book list that is subsequently aggregated with the former list generated through the initial collaborative recommender. Finally, the resulting book list is used to yield the top-n book recommendations.

655,"We study the Japan and U.S. patent records of several decades to demonstrate the effect of collaboration on innovation. We find that statistically inventor teams slightly outperform solo inventors while company teams perform equally well as solo companies. By tracking the performance record of individual teams we find that inventor teams' performance generally degrades with more repeat collaborations. Though company teams' performance displays strongly bursty behavior, long-term collaboration does not significantly help innovation at all. To systematically study the effect of repeat collaboration, we define the repeat collaboration number of a team as the average number of collaborations over all the teammate pairs. We find that mild repeat collaboration improves the performance of Japanese inventor teams and U.S. company teams. Yet, excessive repeat collaboration does not significantly help innovation at both the inventor and company levels in both countries. To control for unobserved heterogeneity, we perform a detailed regression analysis and the results are consistent with our simple observations. The presented results reveal the intricate effect of collaboration on innovation, which may also be observed in other creative projects.","Inoue, Hiroyasu;Liu, Yang-Yu",ArXiv e-prints,X03ab63edf;X048b40b99;X11ae7cc27;X2ac4e488e;X37daf2236;X398f4f077;X4332b64f7;X50b485cdf;X518b80d01;X568c72e60;X58a569a20;X611959469;X749141f27;X7a2b7696e;X93827f2b3;X9b7a0ee21;Xa50b6f0b1;Xae8949ba3;Xbeb5d1fb4;Xc69cb08f4;Xd693a63f3;Xd8e1637c8;Xdf16c16db;Xdfcb6d974;Xe0f7a5334,25,Revealing the intricate effect of collaboration on innovation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2797,2013
656,"The large amount of information contained in bibliographic databases has recently boosted the use of citations, and other indicators based on citation numbers, as tools for the quantitative assessment of scientific research. Citations counts are often interpreted as proxies for the scientific influence of papers, journals, scholars, and institutions. However, a rigorous and scientifically grounded methodology for a correct use of citation counts is still missing. In particular, cross-disciplinary comparisons in terms of raw citation counts systematically favors scientific disciplines with higher citation and publication rates. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the citation patterns of millions of papers, and derive a simple transformation of citation counts able to suppress the disproportionate citation counts among scientific domains. We find that the transformation is well described by a power-law function, and that the parameter values of the transformation are typical features of each scientific discipline. Universal properties of citation patterns descend therefore from the fact that citation distributions for papers in a specific field are all part of the same family of univariate distributions.","Radicchi, Filippo;Castellano, Claudio",PLoS ONE,55481cae43;X5741e9895;Xdc487a05b;Xf4191a713,4,A Reverse Engineering Approach to the Suppression of Citation Biases Reveals Universal Properties of Citation Distributions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6742,2012
657,"This article examines the cognitive evolution and disciplinary diversity of nanotechnology as expressed through the terminology used in titles of nano journal articles. The analysis is based on the NanoBank bibliographic database of 287,106 nano articles published between 1981 and 2004. We perform multifaceted analyses of title words, focusing on 100 most frequent terms. Hierarchical clustering of title terms reveals three distinct time periods of cognitive development of nano research: formative (1981-1990), early (1991-1998), and current (after 1998). Early period is characterized by the introduction of thin film deposition techniques, while the current period is characterized by the increased focus on carbon nanotube and nanoparticle research. We introduce a method to identify disciplinary components of nanotechnology. It shows that the nano research is being carried out in a number of diverse parent disciplines. Currently only 5% of articles are published in dedicated nano-only journals. We find that some 85% of nano research today is multidisciplinary. Hierarchical clustering of disciplinary components reveals that the cognitive content of current nanoscience can be divided into nine clusters. Some clusters account for a large fraction of nano research and are identified with such parent disciplines as the condensed matter and applied physics, materials science, and analytical chemistry. Other clusters represent much smaller parts of nano research, but are as cognitively distinct. In the decreasing order of size, these fields are: polymer science, biotechnology, general chemistry, surface science, and pharmacology. Cognitive content of research published in nano-only journals is closest to nano research published in condensed matter and applied physics journals.","Milojević, Staša",ArXiv e-prints,X06b50dbf8;X0c5cc3198;X12ad5397a;X229a5c293;X2574b32e3;X29e6e596e;X2bc1575df;X2d5c1e9d9;X398043d97;X3cdfc35de;X40c9d2ff0;X49a0122dd;X5bb9a8ab0;X5f960338b;X6db800db7;X900e4ec25;X932899051;X9f92ac4c8;Xa627dd576;Xa8fd41c63;Xac3fa641c;Xb59d18e56;Xb63e4e72e;Xb94711310;Xc75ebc6be;Xc80387a56;Xc9045b4e8;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xd3cc85552;Xd40595885;Xd4be0a1a5;Xd5aae632b;Xe6c88196f;Xed4b81e60;Xf6ab1c973;Xf934c2f31;Xfa601a009,37,Multidisciplinary Cognitive Content of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0127,2012
658,"Understanding how institutional changes within academia may affect the overall potential of science requires a better quantitative representation of how careers evolve over time. Since knowledge spillovers, cumulative advantage, competition, and collaboration are distinctive features of the academic profession, both the employment relationship and the procedures for assigning recognition and allocating funding should be designed to account for these factors. We study the annual production n_{i}(t) of a given scientist i by analyzing longitudinal career data for 200 leading scientists and 100 assistant professors from the physics community. We compare our results with 21,156 sports careers. Our empirical analysis of individual productivity dynamics shows that (i) there are increasing returns for the top individuals within the competitive cohort, and that (ii) the distribution of production growth is a leptokurtic ""tent-shaped"" distribution that is remarkably symmetric. Our methodology is general, and we speculate that similar features appear in other disciplines where academic publication is essential and collaboration is a key feature. We introduce a model of proportional growth which reproduces these two observations, and additionally accounts for the significantly right-skewed distributions of career longevity and achievement in science. Using this theoretical model, we show that short-term contracts can amplify the effects of competition and uncertainty making careers more vulnerable to early termination, not necessarily due to lack of individual talent and persistence, but because of random negative production shocks. We show that fluctuations in scientific production are quantitatively related to a scientist's collaboration radius and team efficiency.","Petersen, A. M.;Riccaboni, M.;Stanley, H.

659,"In a recent paper entitled ""Inconsistencies of Recently Proposed Citation Impact Indicators and how to Avoid Them,"" Schreiber (2012, at arXiv:1202.3861) proposed (i) a method to assess tied ranks consistently and (ii) fractional attribution to percentile ranks in the case of relatively small samples (e.g., for n 〈 100). Schreiber's solution to the problem of how to handle tied ranks is convincing, in my opinion (cf. Pudovkin & Garfield, 2009). The fractional attribution, however, is computationally intensive and cannot be done manually for even moderately large batches of documents. Schreiber attributed scores fractionally to the six percentile rank classes used in the Science and Engineering Indicators of the U.S. National Science Board, and thus missed, in my opinion, the point that fractional attribution at the level of hundred percentiles-or equivalently quantiles as the continuous random variable-is only a linear, and therefore much less complex problem. Given the quantile-values, the non-linear attribution to the six classes or any other evaluation scheme is then a question of aggregation. A new routine based on these principles (including Schreiber's solution for tied ranks) is made available as software for the assessment of documents retrieved from the Web of Science (at http://www.leydesdorff.net/software/i3).","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X051e44aa4;X1500f80b3;X25db0ffdc;X2c0460254;X4120d4139;X4e060ec42;X56eb90aab;X5b194742b;X6991540ae;X6dcf58ec5;X73a553bde;X8b402a927;X9a303b69d;X9b4cf9695;Xa37a63bc5;Xa96de17aa;Xb50e05f0b;Xbddee45f2;Xc3e5924af;Xc41fc7808;Xd3f4b43bf;Xfa49946f2,22,Accounting for the Uncertainty in the Evaluation of Percentile Ranks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1894,2012

Text denoising is a method that extracts the denoised text, comprising the content-rich sentences, from full texts. The performance of the keyphrase indexer is demonstrated on three standard corpora collected from three domains, namely food and agriculture, high energy physics, and biomedical science. Maui is trained using the full texts and denoised texts. The indexer, using its trained models, then extracts keyphrases from test sets comprising full texts, and their denoised and noise parts (i.e., the part of texts that remains after denoising). Experimental findings show that against a gold standard, the denoised-text-trained indexer indexing full texts, performs either better than or as good as its benchmark performance produced by a full-text-trained indexer indexing full texts.","Shams, Rushdi;Mercer, Robert E.",ArXiv e-prints,X0455abc7d;X0bd7c7e23;X4f07eb73a;X650cc875e;X65e5a8367;X69f0cd41d;X6fb60d368;X9aaf252dd;Xc6bf0e024;Xeda8e0329;Xf2ec8245a;Xf78d28a87,12,Investigating Keyphrase Indexing with Text Denoising,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2231,2012

664,"In 2011, Thomson-Reuters introduced the Book Citation Index (BKCI) as part of the Science Citation Index (SCI). The interface of the Web of Science version 5 enables users to search for both ""Books"" and ""Book Chapters"" as new categories.

We explore the two categories with both BKCI and SCI, and in the sister social sciences (SoSCI) and the arts & humanities (A&HCI) databases. Book chapters in edited volumes can be highly cited. Books contain many citing references but are relatively less cited. This may find its origin in the slower circulation of books than of journal articles. It is possible to distinguish between monographs and edited volumes among the ""Books"" scientometrically. Monographs may be underrated in terms of citation impact or overrated using publication performance indicators because individual chapters are counted as contributions separately in terms of articles, reviews, and/or book chapters.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Felt, Ulrike",ArXiv e-prints,X01eca3845;X06ad0dfc3;X06e9c776e;X07ae95b00;X0a1c0feba;X0d1bbcd35;X0e1651da7;X0e634c57f;X0fbe438d5;X1d4f179a4;X1ef16eeab;X216cf3ca8;X2260f352b;X23fbdf352;X2492ae32b;X2c236e722;X2f9bc8a08;X33db5f5b9;X3529e3a96;X3954f5892;X3bfb2b214;X43c5e3905;X43fda881f;X4fea002a2;X56aaf9cb2;X56eb90aab;X57ed0d99d;X58c4fc03e;X5c3e2f892;X5f9ce3741;X5f9f1c4ba;X605f90897;X62f8706f2;X6a31d62fe;X6a826ad20;X6b161e37c;X6de1bfe0b;X6f79a43a6;X70219d323;X7098fe492;X735d96fd9;X7626ceb31;X78a5341d7;X7b7f282d1;X7db0ab6d2;X7f9b71bdc;X81cbd4617;X85ca6c41b;X8602bc083;X8779a2422;X88b9b257f;X8bc02de11;X92d5b79d0;X94074de5d;X956a57e73;X98c7583e4;X9a7b5d387;X9b483ef80;X9c7d6b577;X9c7fd8856;X9cae4d346;Xa0f9f14cc;Xacdcad731;Xae58e57d6;Xb12633e91;Xb1ebea430;Xb69ef527b;Xb71d52d08;Xb79b31e28;Xbc915ef9d;Xbe96cf295;Xc052a911c;Xc0e9a321a;Xc1d60fdf5;Xc21b855a4;Xc2e1ee8c4;Xc33a2625a;Xc6a177ddf;Xc74e9efee;Xc925db7d8;Xcb2d93431;Xcd63cb790;Xcee04cfdd;Xd26756079;Xd6c8e5e83;Xdbfea6663;Xdc3dfd3a5;Xdc95b9df1;Xe4b264ca4;Xe4b6caf0d;Xe7b54a018;Xebac61328;Xec5c49c17;Xee8290620;Xf555aaf08;Xf7d4ab313;Xf8f48800e;Xfc628894f,98,"Edited Volumes, Monographs, and Book Chapters in the Book Citation Index (BKCI) and Science Citation Index (SCI, SoSCI, A&HCI)",http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3717,2012

Open Data comprises text and semi-structured data, but also open multi-modal contents, including music, images, and videos. With the increasing amount of data that is published by governments (see, e.g., data.gov, data.gov.uk or data.gouv.fr), by international organizations (data.worldbank.org or data.undp.org) and by scientific communities (tdar.org, cds.u-strasbg.fr, GenBank, IRIS or KNB) explicitly under an Open Data policy, new challenges arise not only due to the scale at which this data becomes available.

669,"Did celebrity last longer in 1929, 1992 or 2009? We investigate the phenomenon of fame by mining a collection of news articles that spans the twentieth century, and also perform a side study on a collection of blog posts from the last 10 years. By analyzing mentions of personal names, we measure each person's time in the spotlight, using two simple metrics that evaluate, roughly, the duration of a single news story about a person, and the overall duration of public interest in a person. We watched the distribution evolve from 1895 to 2010, expecting to find significantly shortening fame durations, per the much popularly bemoaned shortening of society's attention spans and quickening of media's news cycles. Instead, we conclusively demonstrate that, through many decades of rapid technological and societal change, through the appearance of Twitter, communication satellites, and the Internet, fame durations did not decrease, neither for the typical case nor for the extremely famous, with the last statistically significant fame duration decreases coming in the early 20th century, perhaps from the spread of telegraphy and telephony. Furthermore, while median fame durations stayed persistently constant, for the most famous of the famous, as measured by either volume or duration of media attention, fame durations have actually trended gently upward since the 1940s, with statistically significant increases on 40-year timescales. Similar studies have been done with much shorter timescales specifically in the context of information spreading on Twitter and similar social networking sites.

670,"The first sentence of Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina is: ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" Here Tolstoy means that for a family to be happy, several key aspects must be given (such as good health of all family members, acceptable financial security, and mutual affection). If there is a deficiency in any one or more of these key aspects, the family will be unhappy. In this paper we introduce the Anna Karenina principle as a concept that can explain success in science. Here we will refer to three central areas in modern science in which scarce resources will most usually lead to failure: (1) peer review of research grant proposals and manuscripts (money and journal space as scarce resources), (2) citation of publications (reception as a scarce resource), and (3) new scientific discoveries (recognition as a scarce resource). If resources are scarce (journal space, funds, reception, and recognition), there can be success only when several key prerequisites for the allocation of the resources are fulfilled. If any one of these prerequisites is not fulfilled, the grant proposal, manuscript submission, the published paper, or the discovery will not be successful.","Bornmann, Lutz;Marx, Werner",ArXiv e-prints,53f87a4e26;5543f15fa7;X0592de50b;X0827b95e7;X08c80a7c9;X0a2d28041;X0aa4ea479;X0ab9548df;X0ba6784ca;X0cbe40e0c;X0d59c2096;X0efe1b620;X0f8f7202b;X11c5106d1;X1324562f5;X13965a17c;X141ff4e4b;X1446a0054;X14ebfe667;X156a61bcd;X15ac68ba1;X185ab2e0e;X189ad61ea;X19fbb9448;X1a48376ce;X1ac7870af;X1b5e7d1e1;X1bdea86c4;X1be4fe4e9;X1bff857f8;X1c2b4dccb;X1c3df15dc;X1cf20b153;X1d0220cb9;X1e77342b2;X1ea9626ff;X1f446b2b7;X20957181d;X20c27246b;X21d9c658e;X247e36c2c;X257426975;X261a76ff5;X265a47ad0;X26c9c29a0;X271eb28f8;X283c62bff;X2b1ea527f;X2cfe89f56;X2dc8c6d4f;X2e36daccc;X2ee9ddd50;X337e36a11;X349cf2769;X35a90eb7e;X3763b0003;X3776a3894;X37c90aff2;X384e73757;X3943155a9;X39a9ce923;X39f6cb021;X3a1fa2515;X3a99ad78b;X3b44f8e9b;X3b45eba9a;X3cbe9daf1;X3d5f09d03;X3e950bf16;X3f5c170c3;X3fb3b4441;X406c58976;X40d503a08;X41ada8332;X424ce25ba;X445fb7cfd;X460bbf60b;X46434f877;X46890b5c1;X472a87137;X4a9d6f7d2;X4b99071a0;X4ba0bab4f;X4eba21883;X4fdf89a09;X511a670d3;X52c6e753e;X52d37507c;X52d816012;X53825175d;X55f414e90;X56386bab1;X565f54955;X57ed4a99c;X5af66b1d8;X5ca437545;X5d3a5ab9e;X602f551a2;X60d8f07a4;X641d6e81f;X6595a2722;X67b792afe;X685a64c83;X69943ef7d;X6c2b75e2c;X6c49261e0;X6d259e3d2;X6d59316b5;X6da58c714;X6e41cd6ae;X70c4040c6;X71c109b89;X71dcecab2;X727e7e7fc;X7284324ce;X731ad73ea;X7373f1be2;X73eae8adf;X74444778e;X7627782ab;X773356da7;X7a46e50f4;X7a6996ada;X7a87e3749;X7c9f14a49;X7cf446183;X7d99be965;X7dcf02820;X7e8b9e2ac;X800c6f33e;X806e19fb7;X81ade80e9;X840b055d9;X84f18c62b;X85a26ce33;X87e65c114;X88326b21b;X8a9331544;X8b03551f7;X8ea50cf14;X8ecee1cb0;X8f7062b25;X8fb848b1e;X908e2bf46;X922a58bfe;X95ae1fa2b;X972d854fc;X985138ac0;X98abb98fa;X98e6f9748;X9a1f94a84;X9ae10824c;X9ccac08cb;X9f850853e;Xa0565ae19;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa28f024b3;Xa38c53a47;Xa3f430887;Xa436861ca;Xa508cd9db;Xa53e98c4f;Xa5acd7a76;Xa624eb01f;Xa73bec767;Xa7432601d;Xa8bffe7e4;Xa9003f171;Xac358679b;Xad12f6d98;Xad514e8fb;Xaf1d5be58;Xaf2d341e5;Xb1367150d;Xb358ad0b6;Xb387337d3;Xb4c0a3282;Xb4f82a954;Xb52faabdd;Xb54a10ef3;Xb5bbc2ba5;Xb5cab0d52;Xb735f5e8a;Xb76cecd2d;Xb7b0f9a5a;Xb8451c8dc;Xb9a757859;Xbb7892cb6;Xbc20f7276;Xbc5494d5f;Xbd87c1ce8;Xbe9ab588b;Xbebbfabbc;Xbf10a2c49;Xbf1fc9c9d;Xbf6cee93e;Xc007d91da;Xc104af7c4;Xc1d1be66c;Xc1e8336aa;Xc56010bb7;Xc56a52135;Xc5890f6e3;Xc6a3f8387;Xc73144180;Xc9153fc71;Xc954c472e;Xca309ff7e;Xcb499cc04;Xcc8e653f5;Xccb31a7bd;Xccf5730ef;Xcdc148bcc;Xcddea74b5;Xce18529f7;Xcf8114c93;Xd26481baf;Xd350af8b3;Xd45171b4d;Xd45e63e33;Xd5b5e0cbf;Xd68cf6091;Xd6bc1dc0b;Xd75d026ec;Xd9f0fcf52;Xda4301e46;Xdb96e7ade;Xdbea44bdd;Xdcd36884b;Xdd4089dbf;Xdd6d0ef12;Xdddc3beed;Xdec8a566b;Xe0a47d870;Xe0e15e84b;Xe15d843f7;Xe1f6933a6;Xe2fad88e8;Xe31118d8d;Xe3f467e7f;Xe4428e6c0;Xe45e1085c;Xe49b4a95b;Xe4f94c54a;Xe4fa4b373;Xe62cbffca;Xe68194df8;Xe74cc580d;Xe919805c5;Xe92f2c20f;Xea56724f1;Xec3e0b62a;Xed4f30079;Xee2daba55;Xf082512a5;Xf1041fa03;Xf1fcfe136;Xf32ab2e5a;Xf3f0db5e9;Xf41713fd2;Xf5e78ad65;Xf6a30b34e;Xf8ed369db;Xfa5847705;Xfa6172cfd;Xfa71ea7b5;Xfad0d49ac;Xfb3e8c75b;Xfb7ba5970;Xfc1f50c52;Xfce2285a4;Xffd1f1b07,273,The Anna Karenina principle: A concept for the explanation of success in science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0807,2011

Its traditional, idiosyncratic conceptualization and representation makes the scheme hard to maintain and requires custom implementations of search, query and annotation support.

672,"A new method of hierarchical clustering of graph vertexes is suggested. In the method, the graph partition is determined with an equivalence relation satisfying a recursive definition stating that vertexes are equivalent if the vertexes they point to (or vertexes pointing to them) are equivalent. Iterative application of the partitioning yields a hierarchical clustering of graph vertexes. The method is applied to the citation graph of hep-th. The outcome is a two-level classification scheme for the subject field presented in hep-th, and indexing of the papers from hep-th in this scheme. A number of tests show that the classification obtained is adequate.","Pivovarov, Grigorii;Trunov, Sergei",ArXiv e-prints,X6fc6944d8;X7bc44429b;X9d27e40b4;Xc25e17f3a,4,EqRank: A Self-Consistent Equivalence Relation on Graph Vertexes,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0308044,2003
673,"This paper describes the design and implementation of mechanisms for light-weight inclusion of formal mathematics in informal mathematical writings, particularly in a Web-based setting. This is conceptually done in three stages: (i) by choosing a suitable representation layer (based on RDF) for encoding the information about available resources of formal mathematics, (ii) by exporting this information from formal libraries, and (iii) by providing syntax and implementation for including formal mathematics in informal writings. We describe the use case of an author referring to formal text from an informal narrative, and discuss design choices entailed by this use case. Furthermore, we describe an implementation of the use case within the Agora prototype: a Wiki for collaborating on formalized mathematics.","Tankink, Carst;Lange, Christoph;Urban, Josef",ArXiv e-prints,X059c81276;X0939e13f5;X114423012;X19ae75079;X1b759dd87;X1be05beed;X1c72cc4de;X1e19adb65;X2130cc650;X23b81a2d4;X24aca0f80;X25969b159;X264a533f9;X273f1c2a9;X28788bbe3;X2d9931d3c;X2fc35593e;X31af35ab8;X323196cc2;X36bc06791;X393552260;X3ce5b5901;X3e2c83fb5;X3ffb67e3a;X45020d1ff;X46f1fa5dd;X470bb1abb;X4804036a3;X483d9c15e;X49cdfede4;X4ca1077ed;X4d19fba47;X4d8f01b4f;X57e6720b2;X5c01451c4;X5caec556e;X6047356b6;X61aae8c33;X62bb9d100;X64d4f135e;X65d2d5d47;X671a91082;X672d1f26f;X68c8d571a;X691f91eba;X6b4048de8;X6b4056d1c;X6cbf61610;X6cc33d3e9;X70632a4c9;X71e919385;X72fb6ae01;X7745a0722;X7e143fae0;X7f277af0b;X83f8602a3;X8424b55ad;X865c7597e;X88e2d0d96;X89acd7540;X8a91ae942;X8af0834e1;X8bd24414d;X8c1b2ba5d;X8def00c7b;X8ea243715;X9144a84be;X91ab1af93;X99602874a;X9a6535dce;X9ae812b9e;X9b3be2f8b;X9b9ec0683;X9d03c6398;X9fb9cf00d;Xa110328aa;Xa1ded85f4;Xa3452cd9b;Xa3fbe50bf;Xa41a52f0c;Xa5932fcc9;Xa5d846661;Xaf408ac9a;Xb0d9cdf46;Xb4f263f02;Xb6e855523;Xb76cc8e08;Xb8ccd9f01;Xbea40387e;Xc107070b3;Xc5058fb95;Xc57ad5a42;Xc581f4011;Xc65bf8b88;Xcaa097afd;Xcaff0a9db;Xcc097f739;Xcc3dd9b78;Xceedb1293;Xd06b7f1db;Xd3d8dc489;Xd5ce24668;Xd80a82861;Xdc9c273a3;Xdca5bdb5a;Xdcaf76514;Xde89d716f;Xe12de98a3;Xe29b0a897;Xe29f81ce6;Xe63af2aaa;Xe68c61753;Xf2785f752;Xf34aff11c;Xf44ccb782;Xf53304469;Xf767e2951;Xf9568edd5;Xfa87fa8d5;Xfbb158ae4;Xfc19bee70,121,Point-and-write --- Documenting Formal Mathematics by Reference,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5094,2012

675,"In this paper, we propose a user-based video indexing method, that automatically generates thumbnails of the most important scenes of an online video stream, by analyzing users' interactions with a web video player. As a test bench to verify our idea we have extended the YouTube video player into the VideoSkip system. In addition, VideoSkip uses a web-database (Google Application Engine) to keep a record of some important parameters, such as the timing of basic user actions (play, pause, skip). Moreover, we implemented an algorithm that selects representative thumbnails. Finally, we populated the system with data from an experiment with nine users. We found that the VideoSkip system indexes video content by leveraging implicit users interactions, such as pause and thirty seconds skip. Our early findings point toward improvements of the web video player and its thumbnail generation technique. The VideSkip system could compliment content-based algorithms, in order to achieve efficient video-indexing in difficult videos, such as lectures or sports.","Leftheriotis, Ioannis;Gkonela, Chrysoula;Chorianopoulos, Konstantinos",ArXiv e-prints,X188dcf4df;X391a09ecd;X3f12ea6e5;X4aca07190;X766f529f9;X896f49947;X8ea243715;Xd42592eb3,8,Efficient Video Indexing on the Web: A System that Leverages User Interactions with a Video Player,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6321,2012
676,"This dissertation reports a series of studies of conditions for entanglement in spin systems and multipartite entanglement. There have been numerous studies of entanglement in spin systems. These have usually focused on examining the entanglement between individual spins or determining whether the state of the system is completely separable. Here we present conditions that allow us to determine whether blocks of spins are entangled. We show that sometime these conditions can detect entanglement better than conditions involving individual spins. We apply these conditions to study entanglement in spin wave states, both when there are only a few magnons present and also at finite temperature. We introduce two entanglement conditions that take the form of inequalities involving expectation values of operators. These conditions are sufficient conditions for entanglement that is if they are satisfied the state is entangled, but if they are not, one can say nothing about the entanglement of the state. These conditions are quite flexible, because the operators in them are not specified, and they are particularly useful in detecting multipartite entanglement. We explore the range of utility of these conditions by considering a number of examples of entangled states, and seeing under what conditions entanglement in them can be detected by the inequalities presented here. We explore the possibility of using quantum walks on graphs to find extra edges on a graph. We focus our attention on star graph, whose edges are like spokes coming out of a central hub. If there are N spokes, we show that a quantum walk can find an extra edge connecting two of the spokes or a spoke with a loop on it in O(  N ) steps.","Zubiaga, Arkaitz",Ph.D. Thesis,5542d4aa0a;X053898fcd;X0a6a434ae;X0f929d743;X1114092b5;X4b420e3b6;X563d992d9;X60e410849;X670a36ef8;X820f87d41;X8638dbb73;X89a199d97;X8ea243715;X9cd9c1f28;Xa9c7e8a6d;Xac47f3f67;Xadeeba3fd;Xca5e992cb;Xcad9ef2b9;Xd0161fe7d;Xe5732a080;Xf03d2c44f;Xf3c07a298;Xffd5ebf07,24,Conditions for entanglement in spin systems and for multipartite entanglement,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6521,2012

678,"Over the past two decades, every scholarly publisher has migrated at least the mechanical aspects of their journal publishing so that they utilize digital means. The academy was comfortable with that for a while, but publishers are under increasing pressure to adapt further. At the American Astronomical Society (AAS), we think that means bringing our publishing program to the point of being fully digital, by establishing procedures and policies that regard the digital objects of publication primarily. We have always thought about our electronic journals as databases of digital articles, from which we can publish and syndicate articles one at a time, and we must now put flesh on those bones by developing practices that are consistent with the realities of article at a time publication online. As a learned society that holds the long-term rights to the literature, we have actively taken responsibility for the preservation of the digital assets that constitute our journals, and in so doing we have not forsaken the legacy pre-digital assets. All of us who serve as the long-term stewards of scholarship must begin to evolve into fully digital publishers.","Biemesderfer, Chris",ArXiv e-prints,,0,Fully Digital: Policy and Process Implications for the AAS,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6716,2012
679,"Google Scholar has been well received by the research community. Its promises of free, universal and easy access to scientific literature as well as the perception that it covers better than other traditional multidisciplinary databases the areas of the Social Sciences and the Humanities have contributed to the quick expansion of Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics: two new bibliometric products that offer citation data at the individual level and at journal level. In this paper we show the results of a experiment undertaken to analyze Google Scholar's capacity to detect citation counting manipulation.

680,"We propose a model to analyze citation growth and influences of fitness (competitiveness) factors in an evolving citation network. Applying the proposed method to modeling citations to papers and scholars in the InfoVis 2004 data, a benchmark collection about a 31-year history of information visualization, leads to findings consistent with citation distributions in general and observations of the domain in particular. Fitness variables based on prior impacts and the time factor have significant influences on citation outcomes. We find considerably large effect sizes from the fitness modeling, which suggest inevitable bias in citation analysis due to these factors. While raw citation scores offer little insight into the growth of InfoVis, normalization of the scores by influences of time and prior fitness offers a reasonable depiction of the field's development. The analysis demonstrates the proposed model's ability to produce results consistent with observed data and to support meaningful comparison of citation scores over time.","Ke, Weimao",ArXiv e-prints,X0b504e5da;X23109a4e4;X45020d1ff;X8b402a927;Xc5e2f0758,5,A Fitness Model for Scholarly Impact Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0540,2012

682,"Using the CD-ROM version of the Science Citation Index 2010 (N = 3,705 journals), we study the (combined) effects of (i) fractional counting on the impact factor (IF) and (ii) transformation of the skewed citation distributions into a distribution of 100 percentiles and six percentile rank classes (top-1%, top-5%, etc.). Do these approaches lead to field-normalized impact measures for journals? In addition to the two-year IF (IF2), we consider the five-year IF (IF5), the respective numerators of these IFs, and the number of Total Cites, counted both as integers and fractionally. These various indicators are tested against the hypothesis that the classification of journals into 11 broad fields by PatentBoard/National Science Foundation provides statistically significant between-field effects. Using fractional counting the between-field variance is reduced by 91.7% in the case of IF5, and by 79.2% in the case of IF2. However, the differences in citation counts are not significantly affected by fractional counting. These results accord with previous studies, but the longer citation window of a fractionally counted IF5 can lead to significant improvement in the normalization across fields.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Zhou, Ping;Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X05c471cf2;X374fd329e;X38ca9eca6;X500b82b8c;X6ba34de9e;X6d46addda;X711bf4303;X7b8722eb1;X7d512afb0;X7e8aca3df;X87e3015b7;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa3bc298f5;Xa9760fdb7;Xebd152b25;Xebf4227de;Xfbe7178dc,18,How Can Journal Impact Factors be Normalized across Fields of Science?

683,"A percentile-based bibliometric indicator is an indicator that values publications based on their position within the citation distribution of their field. The most straightforward percentile-based indicator is the proportion of frequently cited publications, for instance the proportion of publications that belong to the top 10% most frequently cited of their field. Recently, more complex percentile-based indicators were proposed. A difficulty in the calculation of percentile-based indicators is caused by the discrete nature of citation distributions combined with the presence of many publications with the same number of citations. We introduce an approach to calculating percentile-based indicators that deals with this difficulty in a more satisfactory way than earlier approaches suggested in the literature. We show in a formal mathematical framework that our approach leads to indicators that do not suffer from biases in favor of or against particular fields of science.","Waltman, Ludo;Schreiber, Michael",ArXiv e-prints,X00645a85c;X0d5bea7a7;X151cb6d99;X17c2a30ab;X1cb1e9cf8;X357d23217;X4fe498315;X56eb90aab;X57a5a1bd5;X5bcc5690e;X5d3123032;X6520d43bd;X67d2efd74;X6eec4bca8;X705c60ce2;X7188a8017;X735bdfefc;X7a19c5209;X8b1902d4d;X8cc608c1d;X9c46fdb05;X9cb351e37;Xa1aea7927;Xa1b994b71;Xa6f342840;Xb559a47de;Xc2a3a2477,27,On the calculation of percentile-based bibliometric indicators,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0646,2012

We outline a path that moves away from the existing model of scientific communication to improve the efficiency in meeting the purpose of public science - knowledge accumulation. We call for six changes: (1) full embrace of digital communication, (2) open access to all published research, (3) disentangling publication from evaluation, (4) breaking the ""one article, one journal"" model with a grading system for evaluation and diversified dissemination outlets, (5) publishing peer review, and, (6) allowing open, continuous peer review. We address conceptual and practical barriers to change, and provide examples showing how the suggested practices are being used already.

The citation impact values are normalized to four subject areas: natural sciences; engineering and technology; medical and health sciences; and agricultural sciences. The results show an increasing trend in citation impact values for France, the UK and especially for Germany across the last thirty years in all subject areas. The citation impact of papers from China is still at a relatively low level (mostly below the world average), but the country follows an increasing trend line. The USA exhibits a relatively stable pattern of high citation impact values across the years. With small impact differences between the publication years, the US trend is increasing in engineering and technology but decreasing in medical and health sciences as well as in agricultural sciences. Similar to the USA, Japan follows increasing as well as decreasing trends in different subject areas, but the variability across the years is small. In most of the years, papers from Japan perform below or approximately at the world average in each subject area.","Bornmann, Lutz;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X1f5d39e39;X2090b1f81;X264ea9ad6;X374fd329e;X414f21652;X53f52cf4a;X5dcee7c04;X5e2038a22;X6d7193d86;X7f3fcb4ac;X8b402a927;X8fc71947b;X998fc6716;X9bc2e85d9;X9c6ae7904;Xa1b994b71;Xa8fd41c63;Xb006fc97c;Xb4aa3beca;Xb4b6c3b87;Xb6b31ee28;Xbcf462da7;Xcf23e1b2a;Xd69b98c13;Xdea5317fe;Xe7b1701ed;Xf80dc5f90,27,Citation impact of papers published from six prolific countries: A national comparison based on InCites data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0680,2012
686,"Recommendation systems for different Document Networks (DN) such as the World Wide Web (WWW) and Digital Libraries, often use distance functions extracted from relationships among documents and keywords. For instance, documents in the WWW are related via a hyperlink network, while documents in bibliographic databases are related by citation and collaboration networks. Furthermore, documents are related to keyterms. The distance functions computed from these relations establish associative networks among items of the DN, referred to as Distance Graphs, which allow recommendation systems to identify relevant associations for individual users. However, modern recommendation systems need to integrate associative data from multiple sources such as different databases, web sites, and even other users. Thus, we are presented with a problem of combining evidence (about associations between items) from different sources characterized by distance functions. In this paper we describe our work on (1) inferring relevant associations from, as well as characterizing, semi-metric distance graphs and (2) combining evidence from different distance graphs in a recommendation system. Regarding (1), we present the idea of semi-metric distance graphs, and introduce ratios to measure semi-metric behavior. We compute these ratios for several DN such as digital libraries and web sites and show that they are useful to identify implicit associations. Regarding (2), we describe an algorithm to combine evidence from distance graphs that uses Evidence Sets, a set structure based on Interval Valued Fuzzy Sets and Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence. This algorithm has been developed for a recommendation system named TalkMine.","Rocha, L.

687,"This paper aims to offer insights into the usability, acceptance and limitations of e-readers with regard to the specific requirements of scholarly text work. To fit into the academic workflow non-linear reading, bookmarking, commenting, extracting text or the integration of non-textual elements must be supported. A group of social science students were questioned about their experiences with electronic publications for study purposes. This same group executed several text-related tasks with the digitized material presented to them in two different file formats on four different e-readers. Their performances were subsequently evaluated by means of frequency analyses in detail. Findings - e-Publications have made advances in the academic world; however e-readers do not yet fit seamlessly into the established chain of scholarly text-processing focusing on how readers use material during and after reading. Our tests revealed major deficiencies in these techniques. With a small number of participants (n=26) qualitative insights can be obtained, not representative results. Further testing with participants from various disciplines and of varying academic status is required to arrive at more broadly applicable results. Practical implications - Our test results help to optimize file conversion routines for scholarly texts. We evaluated our data on the basis of descriptive statistics and abstained from any statistical significance test. The usability test of e-readers in a scientific context aligns with both studies on the prevalence of e-books in the sciences and technical test reports of portable reading devices. Still, it takes a distinctive angle in focusing on the characteristics and procedures of textual work in the social sciences and measures the usability of e-readers and file-features against these standards.","Schomisch, Siegfried;Zens, Maria;Mayr, Philipp",ArXiv e-prints,X0650420d3;X0a35de976;X0d347e85e;X0d6ee9cc0;X0e47f8258;X12e9ba93a;X1c1f7ba02;X2126187f2;X22f8e57cd;X2456d0dbe;X24fe32a5a;X2b8c45117;X2c99ac038;X345b2d593;X36e382f83;X37e20148b;X38b142726;X3f3895728;X424523b0e;X4327c26be;X43a9718d2;X4a37c3f16;X4b0703a92;X4c139bc89;X4dde762f8;X51b86ae87;X5231b16c6;X5465b0e53;X59bf1ad94;X5ec135676;X5f470ea1f;X62979a041;X636df073e;X652cb48e7;X6a0960889;X6a6716032;X6a6c2e3fe;X6b1f1eba9;X6bf7d0eca;X6cb68fbfa;X6eef1469b;X70e9bcc4a;X77f7a4f4e;X7946cff11;X796a3e2b7;X7ca8190fd;X7debd97f8;X82d6c30bf;X83795c9ca;X86f7f710a;X8b9b5e467;X8c2ba3986;X8f9b48280;X928779e83;X93b7504ba;X948c543d0;X9df63b425;X9eb383eae;Xa27fd1f6f;Xa28953d2a;Xa915ea826;Xa9b7c866c;Xa9d7162ab;Xab93a4878;Xabf8ecca8;Xac6c506b4;Xb0a43436c;Xb0ddfff88;Xb1afcf2d0;Xb33cf29e2;Xb50e05f0b;Xb831d27b7;Xb90a9e8ff;Xbc4ca5cff;Xbcf345eea;Xbe2fe3617;Xbe9665da5;Xc2bab799c;Xc7d30ae9f;Xcac16a8a4;Xcc9eb67e2;Xcec8a602c;Xd4e4855bd;Xd6b364582;Xd7470d6fa;Xd827a40b8;Xdf88880d7;Xdf96fa2c0;Xdfa867b6a;Xe0a8b10db;Xe4a1aa633;Xe700e9935;Xe98ce3198;Xea4c18296;Xefa99e201;Xf172a18a7;Xf1ec812b4;Xf3a2f8410;Xf43983a0a;Xf9c9d2264;Xfaf96f47a;Xfef47238f,102,Are e-readers suitable tools for scholarly work?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1227,2012
688,"The literature search has always been an important part of an academic research. It greatly helps to improve the quality of the research process and output, and increase the efficiency of the researchers in terms of their novel contribution to science. As the number of published papers increases every year, a manual search becomes more exhaustive even with the help of today's search engines since they are not specialized for this task. In academics, two relevant papers do not always have to share keywords, cite one another, or even be in the same field. Although a well-known paper is usually an easy pray in such a hunt, relevant papers using a different terminology, especially recent ones, are not obvious to the eye. In this work, we propose paper recommendation algorithms by using the citation information among papers. The proposed algorithms are direction aware in the sense that they can be tuned to find either recent or traditional papers. The algorithms require a set of papers as input and recommend a set of related ones. If the user wants to give negative or positive feedback on the suggested paper set, the recommendation is refined. The search process can be easily guided in that sense by relevance feedback. We show that this slight guidance helps the user to reach a desired paper in a more efficient way. We adapt our models and algorithms also for the venue and reviewer recommendation tasks. Accuracy of the models and algorithms is thoroughly evaluated by comparison with multiple baselines and algorithms from the literature in terms of several objectives specific to citation, venue, and reviewer recommendation tasks. All of these algorithms are implemented within a publicly available web-service framework (http://theadvisor.osu.edu/) which currently uses the data from DBLP and CiteSeer to construct the proposed citation graph.","Küçüktunç, Onur;Saule, Erik;Kaya, Kamer;Çatalyürek, Ümit V.",ArXiv e-prints,X1d6a3ed6f;X326a67d75;X358a0f27a;X3c1b64ce4;X4b0703a92;X5e415907e;X7b4106193;X80b061437;X88d67228d;X8d0e86d31;X959cd01d6;Xc6fc8a16f;Xcacffa3a0;Xd649d11b3;Xe02c0e78f;Xe35ed2fad,16,Recommendation on Academic Networks using Direction Aware Citation Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1143,2012
689,"Allocation of research funding, as well as promotion and tenure decisions, are increasingly made using indicators and impact factors drawn from citations to published work. A debate among scientometricians about proper normalization of citation counts has resolved with the creation of an Integrated Impact Indicator (I3) that solves a number of problems found among previously used indicators. The I3 applies non-parametric statistics using percentiles, allowing highly-cited papers to be weighted more than less-cited ones. It further allows unbundling of venues (i.e., journals or databases) at the article level. Measures at the article level can be re-aggregated in terms of units of evaluation. At the venue level, the I3 creates a properly weighted alternative to the journal impact factor. I3 has the added advantage of enabling and quantifying classifications such as the six percentile rank classes used by the National Science Board's Science & Engineering Indicators.","Wagner, Caroline S.;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X003c016c0;X3d0492c2d;X4b0703a92;X56eb90aab;X6219ca39b;X694a99aca;Xb740c0e25;Xc6be86874,8,"An Integrated Impact Indicator (I3): A New Definition of ""Impact"" with Policy Relevance",http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1419,2012
690,"The transition from analogue to digital archives and the recent explosion of online content offers researchers novel ways of engaging with data. The crucial question for ensuring a balance between the supply and demand-side of data, is whether this trend connects to existing scholarly practices and to the average search skills of researchers. To gain insight into this process we conducted a survey among nearly three hundred (N= 288) humanities scholars in the Netherlands and Belgium with the aim of finding answers to the following questions: 1) To what extent are digital databases and archives used? 2) What are the preferences in search functionalities 3) Are there differences in search strategies between novices and experts of information retrieval? Our results show that while scholars actively engage in research online they mainly search for text and images. General search systems such as Google and JSTOR are predominant, while large-scale collections such as Europeana are rarely consulted. Searching with keywords is the dominant search strategy and advanced search options are rarely used. When comparing novice and more experienced searchers, the first tend to have a more narrow selection of search engines, and mostly use keywords. Our overall findings indicate that Google is the key player among available search engines. This dominant use illustrates the paradoxical attitude of scholars toward Google: while provenance and context are deemed key academic requirements, the workings of the Google algorithm remain unclear. We conclude that Google introduces a black box into digital scholarly practices, indicating scholars will become increasingly dependent on such black boxed algorithms. This calls for a reconsideration of the academic principles of provenance and context.","Kemman, Max;Kleppe, Martijn;Scagliola, Stef",ArXiv e-prints,54f8a0122f;X044687b49;X04effcad4;X063d49237;X06488a33f;X07ee3ada7;X0de4573de;X0f9e3a861;X112f39c4d;X1689eab18;X16d748ea1;X18b819e99;X1b5e2dd80;X1d90e9973;X1e19adb65;X2143701dc;X29c6f98d6;X2a2fa5cb4;X2b28eb7ec;X2b68ad0a8;X32edeb08d;X37c8171c9;X3d18f9a63;X3d690ba40;X3ffd3356c;X47e695617;X489a1f39b;X53d074521;X55c2cf1f4;X5e7219346;X643470502;X652a30ec3;X65cc7544a;X7070f45b3;X743a86d08;X7bded034a;X804a33fc7;X894ab8070;X8d3a48f23;X8e3b9e0c4;X9156758d1;X9922b6e93;X9a4c98464;X9ca8df520;X9db9cea94;X9f3e32889;Xa0f847f3a;Xa3ba5abdd;Xa407e4495;Xa5d4748e5;Xa8f934cf3;Xa9f4fce65;Xb74b8902f;Xb7eb334b5;Xbe87054ff;Xc30e3b9aa;Xc3552d5eb;Xc6a7d0cd6;Xc76d0b86d;Xce7c1c4a9;Xce8a19855;Xd09a5ec45;Xd155c62e0;Xdcfe0f5ad;Xe2d272df9;Xe359715d9;Xe5555f81f;Xe7e690cfc;Xe88aa7346;Xea21062ee;Xea9a18b9f;Xf6061b57e;Xf73f48721;Xfa188ff04;Xfb8c84ac8;Xfd6a66470,76,Just Google It - Digital Research Practices of Humanities Scholars,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2434,2013
691,"The scientific community of researchers in a research specialty is an important unit of analysis for understanding the field specific shaping of scientific communication practices. These scientific communities are, however, a challenging unit of analysis to capture and compare because they overlap, have fuzzy boundaries, and evolve over time. We describe a network analytic approach that reveals the complexities of these communities through examination of their publication networks in combination with insights from ethnographic field studies. We suggest that the structures revealed indicate overlapping sub- communities within a research specialty and we provide evidence that they differ in disciplinary orientation and research practices. By mapping the community structures of scientific fields we aim to increase confidence about the domain of validity of ethnographic observations as well as of collaborative patterns extracted from publication networks thereby enabling the systematic study of field differences. The network analytic methods presented include methods to optimize the delineation of a bibliographic data set in order to adequately represent a research specialty, and methods to extract community structures from this data. We demonstrate the application of these methods in a case study of two research specialties in the physical and chemical sciences.","Velden, Theresa;Lagoze, Carl",ArXiv e-prints,X1bc950393;X54e552d17;X573bdceef;X78dca00ea;X92c739f44;X95ad4144e;X9612bd0a7;X9ac3c6ae0;X9e79f1ed0;Xa1b994b71;Xa2eea5e9b;Xb66fd24ae;Xcbf99df89;Xdad6086b8;Xe3e18cb7e;Xf760b3345,16,The Extraction of Community Structures from Publication Networks to Support Ethnographic Observations of Field Differences in Scientific Communication,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2114,2012

Astronomy librarians are a breed apart, and are taking on new and non-traditional roles as information technology evolves. This talk will explore the future of librarians and librarianship through the lens of some of the recent talks given at the sixth ""Libraries and Information Services in Astronomy"" conference held in Pune, India in February 2010. We will explore the librarian's universe, illustrating how librarians use new technologies to perform such tasks as bibliometrics, how we are re-fashioning our library spaces in an increasingly digital world and how we are confronting the brave new world of Open Access, to name but a few topics.","Lagerstrom, Jill;Grothkopf, Uta",Future Professional Communication in Astronomy II,X38754a010;X45e0770d3;Xc144ca697;Xc1f5d6788;Xc3a51fbb2,5,Astronomy Librarian - Quo Vadis?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1184,2011
693,"Metrics based on percentile ranks (PRs) for measuring scholarly impact involves complex treatment because of various defects such as overvaluing or devaluing an object caused by percentile ranking schemes, ignoring precise citation variation among those ranked next to each other, and inconsistency caused by additional papers or citations. These defects are especially obvious in a small-sized dataset. To avoid the complicated treatment of PRs based metrics, we propose two new indicators - the citation-based indicator (CBI) and the combined impact indicator (CII). Document types of publications are taken into account. With the two indicators, one would no more be bothered by complex issues encountered by PRs based indicators. For a small-sized dataset with less than 100 papers, special calculation is no more needed. The CBI is based solely on citation counts and the CII measures the integrate contributions of publications and citations. Both virtual and empirical data are used so as to compare the effect of related indicators. The CII and the PRs based indicator I3 are highly correlated but the former reflects citation impact more and the latter relates more to publications.","Zhou, Ping;Zhong, Yongfeng",ArXiv e-prints,54c607f5c9;X07ee741e5;X1240db3b2;X25db0ffdc;X9bfdf7c88;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xab01a1fa1;Xd08ab1171;Xe889c8870,10,The citation-based indicator and combined impact indicator - New options for measuring impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2424,2012

However, the proliferation of distributed, inter-connected sources of information and services on the Web poses significant new challenges for managing consistently a huge number of large datasets and their interdependencies. In this paper we focus on the key problem of preserving evolving structured interlinked data.

700,"An academic scientist's professional success depends on publishing. Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive - getting it right - competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive - getting it published. We develop strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and self-serving biases.","Nosek, Brian A.;Spies, Jeffrey R.;Motyl, Matt",ArXiv e-prints,X00164ed3e;X011a5402c;X02c2d4758;X033a4f5e9;X035b7ee6c;X04158097c;X042c7a307;X045c12140;X05a99aebd;X05f6c665a;X060cb355d;X066e3b846;X0679280f9;X06d4e3293;X0a0c50c10;X0a1dbf5d0;X0afba20d1;X0c3f80e16;X11f0e9202;X14b889fd0;X16285e85d;X171f9bd3f;X17af74946;X1a7d22aaa;X1a7f0075d;X1aba48183;X1b46897e3;X1d50e6844;X1e5ae396d;X1e6fd045a;X1fe284e46;X1fe51751e;X202acad40;X218cdf0f9;X2198fecd5;X21cc66242;X21e328a42;X25564cf3f;X256ccf343;X268541f55;X26b2ded60;X26f239059;X274af5bcb;X27c8e85da;X286bf111e;X28ad8a16b;X28c7d1937;X2a160ee43;X2b03ed128;X2b9391606;X2b939f41a;X2ccccb4b3;X2ce86ef03;X2d57165d6;X2e9f3b051;X2ec13996b;X2f20c77ae;X31b2e26a0;X3387d88cf;X350829dcb;X35f7eb8fb;X3602b695f;X367f8025d;X37cc900d0;X37e64aa2d;X391d28363;X3d4001247;X3da556659;X3dc055223;X3e293639d;X407be245d;X41312d027;X43b276fa7;X43e2e8844;X453a162ba;X470147fe1;X47af0455e;X486ec9b04;X48d4c47fe;X49847030f;X499382b21;X4ab3c7eee;X4b8936859;X4c3b2f314;X4c675ab43;X4faa2781b;X50707ee9e;X51d67bced;X532ba3bd6;X544ae442e;X56f995dd9;X5822268d6;X586bb004d;X5a9d59edf;X5bea15148;X5dad6c436;X5f5087efd;X5f9a4a64c;X5fb3b1a47;X60def4d47;X60e923b34;X61fe26c4a;X62b162300;X640d90e34;X65dbb5334;X6736fdbcc;X67d22ec18;X6a0274d49;X6a7a7ab96;X6c105c0f7;X6cc1ac8c6;X6e79fd84b;X6f41bdad2;X6fedec9d8;X6ffe2d323;X70212c3be;X711b6c8db;X72aaca9b1;X733dd227e;X7499c077c;X750139dea;X76eddc29e;X7afecb6a1;X7cdddf75d;X7e4f3f4e1;X7f3b3efbd;X80129cac6;X80a2760c2;X80f0020e9;X842554139;X86645112c;X8913619d0;X89156d1f1;X8ac4df3a4;X8aeef7329;X8ed639b0a;X8efd489ba;X8f9b48280;X908b7704a;X912a35f56;X9181b8afd;X918fa00f7;X9203ada23;X92e96a8e0;X981dd90b0;X99b774f5d;X9a012a031;X9b8447f19;X9bc3e41cd;X9becf8476;X9c1a2a93f;X9f93b46ba;Xa043e3527;Xa18788109;Xa19df6e0e;Xa1aea7927;Xa4c6952bf;Xa4d748bb1;Xa4db0e021;Xa5e0ffc7b;Xa5e5ab416;Xa6155866e;Xa61a92cd9;Xa6266646e;Xa9325430b;Xa94b3b527;Xa966524f2;Xa97e8f7da;Xab3709c8f;Xac50e4a2e;Xac75f43ab;Xac9fe4dd4;Xadb1b5ed7;Xadc3c1e88;Xaec8580cf;Xaef2f2294;Xb090f5427;Xb183b2b67;Xb1a994c82;Xb224e40bd;Xb591e1ac7;Xb65bf0faa;Xb660ca8db;Xb6e99343c;Xb8ee1233d;Xb8f6a1c70;Xb8ff0b7ef;Xb93309449;Xb94560db2;Xba7c87061;Xbaad06a1d;Xbb0abe886;Xbb7b4aebe;Xbbe4dd7f7;Xbd8b935ea;Xbf818c842;Xbf8d07581;Xc0ddb3d35;Xc0ea0afd4;Xc15f8f730;Xc1fc2be0f;Xc42479e2e;Xc76799c14;Xc7bdef8b4;Xc80676bcd;Xc8bc062f6;Xc9898dd7b;Xca4e7d475;Xcbc2296d3;Xcc21df4d6;Xcc2e35a13;Xccac56226;Xcd4c2440b;Xcf0275449;Xd049f165d;Xd15264d94;Xd35a33baf;Xd4992a6ef;Xd69b92eef;Xd6d3670eb;Xd85132afc;Xd964314f8;Xdaf757de4;Xdbe7f8bbb;Xdd5616cea;Xdda124ad6;Xdf9611c55;Xe0173eb2b;Xe06fd0e24;Xe0dfb3e23;Xe159333dc;Xe24431cea;Xe25f1af81;Xe2aa2d248;Xe35ed8950;Xe59959af7;Xe5c87841f;Xe8ad8dd33;Xe8bc321d3;Xeb5ab88bd;Xeb99db30b;Xee13d561f;Xf058f75b1;Xf11eee175;Xf212c1960;Xf4f6e4499;Xf5c52c566;Xf63ca670b;Xf7b83f30d;Xf7c242a6f;Xf80dc5f90;Xf877623ba;Xfb8a26fa5;Xfeee48700;Xff4c908c4;Xff911782d,256,Scientific Utopia: II.

703,"In this paper we present a model based on the principles of Linked Data that can be used to describe the interrelationships of images, texts and other resources to facilitate the interoperability of repositories of medieval manuscripts or other culturally important handwritten documents. The model is designed from a set of requirements derived from the real world use cases of some of the largest digitized medieval content holders, and instantiations of the model are intended as the input to collection-independent page turning and scholarly presentation interfaces. A canvas painting paradigm, such as in PDF and SVG, was selected based on the lack of a one to one correlation between image and page, and to fulfill complex requirements such as when the full text of a page is known, but only fragments of the physical object remain. The model is implemented using technologies such as OAI-ORE Aggregations and OAC Annotations, as the fundamental building blocks of emerging Linked Digital Libraries. The model and implementation are evaluated through prototypes of both content providing and consuming applications. Although the system was designed from requirements drawn from the medieval manuscript domain, it is applicable to any layout-oriented presentation of images of text.","Sanderson, Robert;Albritton, Benjamin;Schwemmer, Rafael;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X04078c9cf;X130a7ab78;X140d3d8b6;X170d2c153;X1cda1dd4d;X200da1eff;X2553f3e9a;X4a72d91a2;X4b9840bd8;X4be87f561;X55bd90314;X6ae3553cc;X75fa19cdd;X7a5cac3bc;X81097cef0;X854cda1db;X9c3ec4816;X9c625fef9;Xa1b994b71;Xb65543532;Xc2f5fb051;Xd4c88e13b;Xdee8a795c;Xe3c5929d1;Xef960e214;Xfc440e438;Xfc7549c8d,27,SharedCanvas: A Collaborative Model for Medieval Manuscript Layout Dissemination,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2925,2011
704,"There has been a lively debate in many fields, including statistics and related applied fields such as psychology and biomedical research, on possible reforms of the scholarly publishing system. Currently, referees contribute so much to improve scientific papers, both directly through constructive criticism and indirectly through the threat of rejection.

705,"Historically, papers have been physically bound to the journal in which they were published but in the electronic age papers are available individually, no longer tied to their respective journals. Hence, papers now can be read and cited based on their own merits, independently of the journal's physical availability, reputation, or Impact Factor. We compare the strength of the relationship between journals' Impact Factors and the actual citations received by their respective papers from 1902 to 2009. Throughout most of the 20th century, papers' citation rates were increasingly linked to their respective journals' Impact Factors. However, since 1990, the advent of the digital age, the strength of the relation between Impact Factors and paper citations has been decreasing. This decrease began sooner in physics, a field that was quicker to make the transition into the electronic domain. Furthermore, since 1990, the proportion of highly cited papers coming from highly cited journals has been decreasing, and accordingly, the proportion of highly cited papers not coming from highly cited journals has also been increasing. Should this pattern continue, it might bring an end to the use of the Impact Factor as a way to evaluate the quality of journals, papers and researchers.","Lozano, George A.;Lariviere, Vincent;Gingras, Yves",ArXiv e-prints,54d5fb9e7a;X00bd80b2c;X00d07cc26;X020ea9137;X02fc48f3b;X03056c0d1;X03ab63edf;X043ceb40a;X048299ba0;X055ebb3ab;X05b00a650;X07b6e119a;X07bbe0aa2;X07c20c0b2;X08537be94;X08dd0b9f3;X0b24e6167;X0bb577a13;X0f3d31e05;X10486fe56;X120139485;X128a21354;X12df1aebc;X13caca68a;X14d8bf488;X167ba1db6;X17e3cf7b3;X19595c3d2;X19a419461;X1aacddc7c;X1bbbd8613;X1ccc3eab3;X1d12e2a9c;X1d54a57b9;X1ddd94d14;X202aba6a4;X2079fd236;X2347d0854;X23a14acc4;X243a32d8b;X24a7b4dd8;X276ecb6f7;X283592299;X2997914df;X2abb24e41;X2aca27552;X2adbd6e30;X2baf55aeb;X2d8bdf54e;X2dc0798ee;X2e520132e;X2ede2bd8b;X2f909457b;X304b52516;X3077d0b64;X319e43cf9;X31c3a664f;X31f8fedc6;X335b885ac;X33c7bf574;X34374cc7e;X348814447;X35676912a;X361f36206;X37206498f;X3763cf0f9;X37fe48d5f;X3931348bd;X3bb114ea2;X3cb6f2499;X3cf50454c;X3d1dadd34;X3da6d53b9;X3e351e79b;X3e3686134;X3e861284e;X405681e78;X4157e801c;X438cf79b6;X4422485ea;X44ff416a8;X46ee22bfa;X47c5aaa64;X49959ef38;X49bf33aca;X4b0703a92;X4c1b6d5d2;X4ddbe11c9;X4df2c070e;X5176d0037;X527d043c7;X52b39b86d;X533751398;X53a6fd4b1;X55d16dbfa;X5a04023e5;X5a6c7834c;X5d2f1264f;X5db747f61;X5f5a42405;X606834767;X6150d7aed;X623ea4191;X6270efe53;X656033cc9;X659416980;X6974142b8;X6a480f14d;X6bb5be94b;X6d042934a;X6d6d0261c;X6f537c9df;X71435e249;X717898dbc;X72ae8754f;X730e8daa9;X7322de7d2;X735766026;X74a769226;X74c43a30b;X78630706a;X7e1d5269b;X8066b6f9f;X8074c1786;X80a2760c2;X8154a33b0;X8249adb30;X824feb4c4;X82b0904d4;X842b4529c;X8553c233a;X855c05906;X85aa1c484;X85d4cea85;X86c487c6e;X87c29379d;X898d74472;X89db2b064;X8a28aba22;X8b371be38;X8d8368ebf;X90c326b2d;X9156758d1;X9193b8859;X91c0bdfad;X949aeebf6;X959cd01d6;X9894090bc;X98987b0c7;X989c4d74e;X98c3f5ed4;X992683069;X9b0020949;X9e0d872b0;X9ecb4b99b;X9ff0a4a55;Xa0809c730;Xa19df6e0e;Xa1b1c45b9;Xa1b994b71;Xa318b465e;Xa3acb144b;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa4a8ac029;Xa6ede1484;Xa8213beed;Xaa1279d3b;Xaee53314a;Xaf353ea0c;Xafe1ea12b;Xb00c25219;Xb12d4280a;Xb1875d7bd;Xb2d3295d2;Xb3510f4e7;Xb46e37eee;Xb5d10323d;Xb704d107a;Xb7cb1d98d;Xb90c2883c;Xb921ace92;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbbdc51016;Xbc97f1087;Xbcf693515;Xbcfec48e6;Xbd74eb4c2;Xbdb1deff2;Xbf65e73af;Xbfc4742a8;Xc0550e5db;Xc12e48f6a;Xc2ede0a07;Xc31fe8ad2;Xc4b73eef0;Xc5268eeff;Xc571696d8;Xc6b8fa295;Xca64e2993;Xcb405fb49;Xcc6088f51;Xcc7e5a444;Xcd9add8f9;Xcff5d4cb9;Xd011d9c1b;Xd0f4dfab3;Xd0f8ae26c;Xd18d7659f;Xd20c02f1f;Xd2aee4a34;Xd2e4d7f6d;Xd4b1f933f;Xd612a3b46;Xd68b837a4;Xd6f93799d;Xd79f506f1;Xd89d6612f;Xdacd6aa01;Xdc9dc0f61;Xe31e5d3f5;Xe39226f0f;Xe4373cc9b;Xe5283b6b2;Xe55a231ea;Xe919b82e7;Xec12c42c0;Xec32efea7;Xecba65123;Xef524ff51;Xf1ec580f1;Xf3b223276;Xf3d7c2573;Xf54c974b2;Xf63e724b1;Xf6ae2116e;Xf7432e2ed;Xf7626990a;Xf7adf186d;Xf9b026012;Xfb417aabc;Xfb7e78693;Xfdb2ccd7a;Xfe20a39c8;Xff4189165,245,The weakening relationship between the Impact Factor and papers' citations in the digital age,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4328,2012

707,"With the explosive growth of internet technology, easy transfer of digital multimedia is feasible. However, this kind of convenience with which authorized users can access information, turns out to be a mixed blessing due to information piracy. The emerging field of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems addresses issues related to the intellectual property rights of digital content. In this paper, an object-oriented (OO) DRM system, called ""Imaging System with Watermarking and Attack Resilience"" (ISWAR), is presented that generates and authenticates color images with embedded mechanisms for protection against infringement of ownership rights as well as security attacks. In addition to the methods, in the object-oriented sense, for performing traditional encryption and decryption, the system implements methods for visible and invisible watermarking. This paper presents one visible and one invisible watermarking algorithm that have been integrated in the system. The qualitative and quantitative results obtained for these two watermarking algorithms with several benchmark images indicate that high-quality watermarked images are produced by the algorithms. With the help of experimental results it is demonstrated that the presented invisible watermarking techniques are resilient to the well known benchmark attacks and hence a fail-safe method for providing constant protection to ownership rights.","Mohanty, Saraju P.",ArXiv e-prints,X1bae03497;X2672f9369;X3864c6cd9;X38b1c7b1e;X3cc7ebe6b;X40c57f4bc;X4f483f465;X529fc7172;X546c5946e;X6cc0e7269;X6f9d0c35d;X70f6a2897;X97afd26cb;X9b7dc69c1;X9d6382d53;X9fbf87f9a;Xa1fcfd999;Xa31ad9ba6;Xb7f729ca0;Xb8e9c65e5;Xc2d44547d;Xf2b0dc7cc,22,ISWAR: An Imaging System with Watermarking and Attack Resilience,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4489,2012

An intermediate report was released in November 2009 addressing the general issues of data preservation in HEP. This paper includes and extends the intermediate report. It provides an analysis of the research case for data preservation and a detailed description of the various projects at experiment, laboratory and international levels.

However, increasingly scholars are also visible on the Web, establishing presences in a growing variety of social ecosystems. But how wide and established is this presence, and how do measures of social Web impact relate to their more traditional counterparts? To answer this, we sampled 57 presenters from the 2010 Leiden STI Conference, gathering publication and citations counts as well as data from the presenters' Web ""footprints."" We found Web presence widespread and diverse: 84% of scholars had homepages, 70% were on LinkedIn, 23% had public Google Scholar profiles, and 16% were on Twitter. For sampled scholars' publications, social reference manager bookmarks were compared to Scopus and Web of Science citations; we found that Mendeley covers more than 80% of sampled articles, and that Mendeley bookmarks are significantly correlated (r=.45) to Scopus citation counts.","Bar-Ilan, Judit;Haustein, Stefanie;Peters, Isabella;Priem, Jason;Shema, Hadas;Terliesner, Jens",ArXiv e-prints,X03ab63edf;X042c7a307;X07c20c0b2;X08816bcd5;X0c3bbc4d7;X0dce840d8;X1064cbf87;X10981e54d;X1174adb42;X13660f829;X14ae07017;X1562586bb;X15fb2a1c1;X1689eab18;X16964cdc3;X1914ff73e;X19420e4e4;X1b3ac9b1b;X1ca5ccd6f;X242a0f12f;X25db0ffdc;X262e32a3c;X280394c01;X2abb24e41;X2baf55aeb;X2dc0798ee;X30cd2689b;X33ba397b6;X348814447;X37e72d3e8;X383496555;X39a8cac2d;X3a1db4ff7;X3da6d53b9;X3e1e4318b;X4070eec0d;X414dce407;X451378f08;X45a2270b8;X4b0703a92;X4c058a1f0;X4c1b6d5d2;X4d362501a;X4def7017e;X4fe498315;X527d043c7;X561ffdb47;X5778e4b1a;X58a4662eb;X5a04023e5;X5c4daf878;X5d2f1264f;X5ddd62ce0;X5fb0b969a;X61645a5d3;X624092295;X6611fef3f;X6974142b8;X699ee97d8;X6ea0208c4;X6f2ab6fb9;X6f412e63c;X70cf92421;X7133e65af;X74c1e3117;X7549f250d;X767622b31;X79cbdcb26;X7b7e2aa91;X7faeadb61;X8249adb30;X84897d25f;X86c487c6e;X88be1f8d8;X898d74472;X8c3a2176a;X8c8612c5e;X8dfc9c46e;X9156758d1;X959cd01d6;X9a9305255;X9d78f02d4;X9e8ea3448;X9f3896081;Xa1b994b71;Xa5a39af94;Xa9b7c866c;Xab017f597;Xac892ef50;Xafc83bd12;Xb1875d7bd;Xb42cd10be;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbc648fe35;Xc118e0e26;Xc2c53801d;Xc369f5355;Xc64e250c2;Xc86aa48f6;Xca20dbb99;Xccee73e30;Xcd3a91ebb;Xcddea854a;Xcea720adf;Xcf0b94bff;Xd0058c3de;Xd011d9c1b;Xd247a0029;Xd3462ddd4;Xd49d9ff73;Xd662c8d71;Xd72f8f49e;Xda7b026af;Xdc00e7eda;Xdcce21435;Xdcd26e03b;Xdd0895f9e;Xde455f245;Xdea503633;Xdf630e8a2;Xdfab3e826;Xe35ed2fad;Xe4c4a2357;Xe5283b6b2;Xe5956d6e5;Xe5d29871a;Xe7156ddb2;Xe7478ac97;Xe8e2c30b2;Xe8feb0269;Xf290b663b;Xf3b223276;Xf55cd5bd8;Xf74cec7ce;Xf78856bbc;Xfc17ea670;Xfc6141afb;Xfd5d23dee;Xfddcb3fd1,140,Beyond citations: Scholars' visibility on the social Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5611,2012
710,"This paper describes the first results obtained by implementing a novel approach to rank vertices in a heterogeneous graph, based on the PageRank family of algorithms and applied here to the bipartite graph of papers and authors as a first evaluation of its relevance on real data samples. With this approach to evaluate research activities, the ranking of a paper/author depends on that of the papers/authors citing it/him or her. We compare the results against existing ranking methods (including methods which simply apply PageRank to the graph of papers or the graph of authors) through the analysis of simple scenarios based on a real dataset built from DBLP and CiteseerX. The results show that in all examined cases the obtained result is most pertinent with our method which allows to orient our future work to optimizing the execution of this algorithm.","Burnside, Gerard;Hong, Dohy;Nguyen-Kim, Son;Liu, Liang",ArXiv e-prints,X082278616;X0e21838a2;X41abc1ee7;X661dc3f0a;X74a8abad9;X9e656b63b;Xafc83bd12;Xdcd4d3a49;Xee0fde90d,9,Publication Induced Research Analysis (PIRA) - Experiments on Real Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6373,2012
711,"The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) can be used as data exchange format in different domains. It allows different parties to exchange data by providing common understanding of the basic concepts in the domain. XML covers the syntactic level, but lacks support for reasoning. Ontology can provide a semantic representation of domain knowledge which supports efficient reasoning and expressive power. One of the most popular ontology languages is the Web Ontology Language (OWL). It can represent domain knowledge using classes, properties, axioms and instances for the use in a distributed environment such as the World Wide Web.

714,"For the study of citation networks, a challenging problem is modeling the high clustering. Existing studies indicate that the promising way to model the high clustering is a copying strategy, i.e., a paper copies the references of its neighbor as its own references. However, the line of models highly underestimates the number of abundant triangles observed in real citation networks and thus cannot well model the high clustering. In this paper, we point out that the failure of existing models lies in that they do not capture the connecting patterns among existing papers. By leveraging the knowledge indicated by such connecting patterns, we further propose a new model for the high clustering in citation networks. Experiments on two real world citation networks, respectively from a special research area and a multidisciplinary research area, demonstrate that our model can reproduce not only the power-law degree distribution as traditional models but also the number of triangles, the high clustering coefficient and the size distribution of co-citation clusters as observed in these real networks.","Ren, Fu-Xin;Shen, Hua-Wei;Cheng, Xue-Qi",Physica A Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,X3d2b105bc;X41e2f2816;X48ad0e866;X667f2f304;X67f1cff07;X7e1fd6b75;Xb50e05f0b;Xba0c7d846;Xce1f0fbe5;Xdcf416fae;Xe596b95bd;Xeb18b1b55;Xec3e0b62a,13,Modeling the clustering in citation networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4209,2012

However, SKOS vocabularies often differ in terms of quality, which reduces their applicability across system boundaries. Here we investigate how we can support taxonomists in improving SKOS vocabularies by pointing out quality issues that go beyond the integrity constraints defined in the SKOS specification. We identified potential quantifiable quality issues and formalized them into computable quality checking functions that can find affected resources in a given SKOS vocabulary. We implemented these functions in the qSKOS quality assessment tool, analyzed 15 existing vocabularies, and found possible quality issues in all of them.","Mader, Christian;Haslhofer, Bernhard;Isaac, Antoine",ArXiv e-prints,X036c5abea;X09f83a1a2;X0f41ed292;X1307f0178;X13104d0a8;X131550b48;X1be611d3b;X27c7ec194;X2b00d2266;X2eac18788;X387cc1ce5;X400e069fc;X4841749c0;X49cdfede4;X51e341467;X573bdceef;X619204005;X649f6a828;X73089dbed;X859fe3b63;X8d8e6fc59;X91a5d8d74;X9485900fd;X984f039b6;X9dcbcbd18;Xa0b556b01;Xa52c2188e;Xae73f80ba;Xbc7245404;Xbdd7cb30b;Xcc6a8e8aa;Xd72e4a5cf;Xed2e00b9f;Xee6ab24f4;Xf9e8193b0,35,Finding Quality Issues in SKOS Vocabularies,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1339,2012
716,"Attempts to understand the consequence of any individual scientist's activity within the long-term trajectory of science is one of the most difficult questions within the philosophy of science. Because scientific publications play such as central role in the modern enterprise of science, bibliometric techniques which measure the ``impact'' of an individual publication as a function of the number of citations it receives from subsequent authors have provided some of the most useful empirical data on this question. Until recently, Thompson/ISI has provided the only source of large-scale ``inverted'' bibliographic data of the sort required for impact analysis. In the end of 2004, Google introduced a new service, GoogleScholar, making much of this same data available. Here we analyze 203 publications, collectively cited by more than 4000 other publications. We show surprisingly good agreement between data citation counts provided by the two services. Data quality across the systems is analyzed, and potentially useful complementarities between are considered. The additional robustness offered by multiple sources of such data promises to increase the utility of these measurements as open citation protocols and open access increase their impact on electronic scientific publication practices.","Belew, Richard K.",ArXiv e-prints,X0485af992;X07c20c0b2;X120139485;X1e6fff284;X2aba446af;X2abb24e41;X2ef8a4546;X3d76238d5;X4b0703a92;X4c1b6d5d2;X4df216004;X50126a0b2;X51a4a14d7;X527d043c7;X56eb90aab;X5d2f1264f;X62857ac2a;X6d47c74f4;X74c43a30b;X8249adb30;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X97bf2236e;X9cd764f08;Xb1875d7bd;Xb276fa294;Xb50e05f0b;Xba9e90876;Xbd5f53904;Xc78c2896c;Xcb6c2cdfc;Xcfef00f56;Xda7b026af;Xede9e6758;Xf3b223276,35,Scientific impact quantity and quality: Analysis of two sources of bibliographic data,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0504036,2005
717,"According to current research in bibliometrics, percentiles (or percentile rank classes) are the most suitable method for normalising the citation counts of individual publications in terms of the subject area, the document type and the publication year. Up to now, bibliometric research has concerned itself primarily with the calculation of percentiles. This study suggests how percentiles can be analysed meaningfully for an evaluation study. Publication sets from four universities are compared with each other to provide sample data. These suggestions take into account on the one hand the distribution of percentiles over the publications in the sets (here: universities) and on the other hand concentrate on the range of publications with the highest citation impact - that is, the range which is usually of most interest in the evaluation of scientific performance.","Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X003f82480;X00975fc71;X064f94e14;X080050154;X08f7f111d;X0b6aa17b9;X0cb760a1b;X0de25aaaf;X0f4b69d35;X120e61da8;X12e182df5;X172ec1a77;X1772fe0a1;X1793666aa;X198e195c0;X19947d49f;X1adbff970;X1b10675de;X1b234e795;X1c08579cd;X1c230ce67;X1d51001cd;X1e108c0cd;X1e3139382;X1f3130d3e;X2370abf1e;X23e2435fd;X25a384ed9;X26840746d;X29450e064;X2e8d28ceb;X34c04e82e;X37af925d3;X399a7b9e7;X39ff9692c;X3a9b81087;X3f1cfc2b7;X3fcbd0790;X4127857f4;X43a89d60f;X4410058a4;X441f01ede;X4813d38da;X4b102aaf6;X4e6a1862a;X4f7ebc746;X508f12de7;X52840e0f5;X52f286a8a;X574845615;X57cc42830;X582d87a13;X599b80973;X5a2018267;X5ab27f815;X5b833bb93;X60432e28f;X625bd72d0;X6374b8178;X6426b0a72;X6439cde0d;X66c4c7896;X66d016141;X6787304e8;X679186e3a;X6a67a215e;X6cad10ae6;X6ce086677;X6dd8568e6;X6f6f9e933;X6fb17ffe3;X704bdf4de;X708ffa199;X70acb5481;X70f224af7;X71b760cf8;X721a0943f;X7309a609d;X734a1cdaa;X74559f994;X75cc42d2b;X7900170f5;X7a2839eec;X7a89e1063;X7c66515e2;X7d0c5038e;X7ed6aab25;X7ede86fc4;X81097cef0;X87a6bd722;X8b402a927;X8d3e65795;X8d8539fbd;X8e3349b2d;X8f987e401;X8fd87e3de;X90edeeead;X91fa32b77;X92dcad869;X9630237aa;X9639d59f9;X97144553d;X99d574778;X9cda01296;X9d05cfc6d;Xa01d679e7;Xa1aea7927;Xa1b994b71;Xa42cc7b28;Xa5751d2de;Xa59e678b1;Xa80bb253b;Xa9bfaaa6f;Xab6568282;Xac079cb5b;Xad641da51;Xae2a93dbc;Xb01d5e740;Xb5e0739b1;Xb8a5a4084;Xbae6d32d1;Xbf0d7a55b;Xbf4cf59fa;Xc271b3459;Xc273289d6;Xc279134c1;Xc8b3bfdf3;Xca2ae6425;Xcbc75bf2b;Xce50862f1;Xcf7b116e2;Xd4e92b5c4;Xd801ad787;Xd8da1a580;Xd9cba70ba;Xde4dfb7ee;Xdfc151109;Xe259ef44c;Xe3bb4bf2b;Xea7816211;Xecb903c0b;Xef8bc903f;Xef9998e60;Xf0f01af24;Xf109a69df;Xf1d862ebc;Xf1f525079;Xf350cbb87;Xf36d86e9a;Xf3f53fba5;Xf449368c1;Xf593393d4;Xf8083a60c;Xf92f9fda3;Xf9e6e5059;Xfa0868452;Xfa66f5b00;Xfb225f268;Xfbacd89c0;Xfc6c8fa23;Xfe5534078,161,"How to analyse percentile impact data meaningfully in bibliometrics: The statistical analysis of distributions, percentile rank classes and top-cited papers",http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1741,2012

719,"Statistical distributions with heavy tails are ubiquitous in natural and social phenomena. Since the entries in heavy tail have unproportional significance, the knowledge of its exact shape is very important. Citations of scientific papers form one of the best-known heavy tail distributions. Even in this case there is a considerable debate whether citation distribution follows the log-normal or power-law fit. The goal of our study is to solve this debate by measuring citation distribution for a very large and homogeneous data. We measured citation distribution for 418, 438 Physics papers published in 1980-1989 and cited by 2008. While the log-normal fit deviates too strong from the data, the discrete power-law function with the exponent γ = 3.15 does better and fits 99.955% of the data. However, the extreme tail of the distribution deviates upward even from the power-law fit and exhibits a dramatic ""runaway"" behavior. The onset of the runaway regime is revealed macroscopically as the paper garners 1000-1500 citations, however the microscopic measurements of autocorrelation in citation rates are able to predict this behavior in advance.","Golosovsky, M.;Solomon, S.",European Physical Journal Special Topics,X2b1536368;X2fac49605;X426cab82b;X43c7bb407;X94ba7afb2;Xc369f5355;Xd25ddc9c2;Xe685cf7a5,8,Runaway events dominate the heavy tail of citation distributions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1999,2012
720,Term suggestion or recommendation modules can help users to formulate their queries by mapping their personal vocabularies onto the specialized vocabulary of a digital library. While we examined actual user queries of the social sciences digital library Sowiport we could see that nearly one third of the users were explicitly looking for author names rather than terms. Common term recommenders neglect this fact. By picking up the idea of polyrepresentation we could show that in a standardized IR evaluation setting we can significantly increase the retrieval performances by adding topical-related author names to the query. This positive effect only appears when the query is additionally expanded with thesaurus terms.

We investigate the temporal evolution of bibliometric properties, like size of the discipline, productivity of scholars, and collaboration level in papers, as well as of large-scale network properties, like reachability and average separation distance among scientists, distribution of the number of scholar collaborators, network clustering and network assortativity by number of collaborators.","Franceschet, Massimo",ArXiv e-prints,X0c3ca1f1e;X17a4bfb2c;X2e408fc45;X44e4b6327;X56fdaaba6;X657f3a1a7;X6a28cd31d;X76f8a81fb;X89900e64f;Xe201ef00e;Xf0bef9ec6,11,Collaboration in computer science: a network science approach.

726,"Memory Bound Functions have been proposed for fighting spam, resisting Sybil attacks and other purposes. A particular implementation of such functions has been proposed in which the average effort required to generate a proof of effort is set by parameters E and l to E * l. The distribution of effort required to generate an individual proof about this average is fairly broad. When particular uses of these functions are envisaged, the choice of E and l, and the system design surrounding the generation and verification of proofs of effort, need to take the breadth of the distribution into account. We show the distribution for this implementation, discuss the system design issues in the context of two proposed applications, and suggest an improved implementation.","Rosenthal, David S.

727,"This paper discovers patterns of knowledge dissemination among scientific disciplines. While the transfer of knowledge is largely unobservable, citations from one discipline to another have been proven to be an effective proxy to study disciplinary knowledge flow. This study constructs a knowledge flow network in that a node represents a Journal Citation Report subject category and a link denotes the citations from one subject category to another. Using the concept of shortest path, several quantitative measurements are proposed and applied to a knowledge flow network. Based on an examination of subject categories in Journal Citation Report, this paper finds that social science domains tend to be more self-contained and thus it is more difficult for knowledge from other domains to flow into them; at the same time, knowledge from science domains, such as biomedicine-, chemistry-, and physics-related domains can access and be accessed by other domains more easily. This paper also finds that social science domains are more disunified than science domains, as three fifths of the knowledge paths from one social science domain to another need at least one science domain to serve as an intermediate. This paper contributes to discussions on disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity by providing empirical analysis.","Yan, Erjia",ArXiv e-prints,X037b0bf9a;X0cd282cd6;X163dcfd09;X2ff5ab9ce;X3c5b5142e;X41320a406;X4d2afb216;X52869b52c;X5441a2084;X597dd537e;X5e174a829;X5f9e90f59;X5fe8a7af4;X6e6716125;X70c0b45ca;X74cb266b9;X79efe5662;X9b1f52552;X9bc2e85d9;Xa1b994b71;Xa79ec93ae;Xaf854c44b;Xbaf26a80e;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xccac6254d;Xce542a7c0;Xe1f708de8;Xebb7a1538;Xec32fbffd;Xed730f4ba;Xfc7ef0f92;Xfdab100be;Xff1f977bf;Xfff3c4b2e,34,Finding knowledge paths among scientific disciplines,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2546,2013
728,"Most refereed journal articles today are published in subscription journals, accessible only to subscribing institutions, hence losing considerable research impact. Making articles freely accessible online (""Open Access,"" OA) maximizes their impact. Articles can be made OA in two ways: by self-archiving them on the web (""Green OA"") or by publishing them in OA journals (""Gold OA""). We compared the percent and growth rate of Green and Gold OA for 14 disciplines in two random samples of 1300 articles per discipline out of the 12,500 journals indexed by Thomson-Reuters-ISI using a robot that trawled the web for OA full-texts. We sampled in 2009 and 2011 for publication year ranges 1998-2006 and 2005-2010, respectively. Green OA (21.4%) exceeds Gold OA (2.4%) in proportion and growth rate in all but the biomedical disciplines, probably because it can be provided for all journals articles and does not require paying extra Gold OA publication fees. The spontaneous overall OA growth rate is still very slow (about 1% per year). If institutions make Green OA self-archiving mandatory, however, it triples percent Green OA as well as accelerating its growth rate.","Gargouri, Yassine;Larivière, Vincent;Gingras, Yves;Carr, Les;Harnad, Stevan",ArXiv e-prints,5537a3be9f;X020131530;X03815db94;X05051f60d;X05d226a03;X0970d64d1;X0de275e8a;X12a1fc7a4;X192109981;X1a9fe3a98;X235cdb554;X2446b2d25;X258e3abb1;X287d184dc;X29b214685;X31c6258d6;X32fb23ace;X4114f4fdc;X4327c26be;X4372454f2;X46491230e;X4879ac23e;X4b6cb1b84;X57f66fc98;X5868b22ef;X59a3e71e8;X5a04023e5;X5a72e6a96;X5f62b9fb6;X61da8b5b5;X6919d9d58;X6ad2713e4;X6c9c31507;X6ca4d31bb;X711cdd2db;X73f7e7b68;X7426e063c;X779f81312;X7b0d92ee4;X7b116c5e4;X7c6804b86;X7cfb9ba12;X7f930f7de;X831a9da15;X83f22a515;X864301e07;X86879847d;X8a253be59;X8e2c73bf1;X8ed626364;X8fed7ceb7;X8ff118870;X9728c2781;X997e03c0f;X9cfc4317d;X9f1f9977b;Xa418d1dc6;Xa51afcf1f;Xaa8df4d82;Xad2613844;Xb86bdf63c;Xbada48fed;Xbcffc22ba;Xc6e87aa04;Xc970cf359;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xceb661763;Xcf657c319;Xd143948e0;Xd37f91382;Xd44c6f6d4;Xd8a4a7a66;Xd8c4af0a5;Xd909a6f84;Xdb6f88a49;Xdb8e2b1b9;Xdc3843ce2;Xdc682c9d2;Xdd9ebd04f;Xdf3256b8f;Xe0ccbd9b4;Xe30093a0b;Xe35929e25;Xe6cb9f4b7;Xe8d0e1460;Xeb6d0b033;Xebc246d47;Xec02a9f7d;Xecbabd017;Xecde9a6d6;Xeddc7fa26;Xf0c0d4331;Xf231dcdf5;Xf49b9b605;Xf6b2725dd;Xfa8675101;Xfe9bef16d;Xff4189165,98,"Green and Gold Open Access Percentages and Growth, by Discipline",http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3664,2012
729,"Positional and relational perspectives on network data have led to two different research traditions in textual analysis and social network analysis, respectively. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) focuses on the latent dimensions in textual data; social network analysis (SNA) on the observable networks. The two coupled topographies of information-processing in the network space and meaning-processing in the vector space operate with different (nonlinear) dynamics. The historical dynamics of information processing in observable networks organizes the system into instantiations; the systems dynamics, however, can be considered as self-organizing in terms of fluxes of communication along the various dimensions that operate with different codes. The development over time adds evolutionary differentiation to the historical integration; a richer structure can process more complexity.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X0aacfccbb;X1f75234e5;X2ef8a4546;X31c1b272f;X3648f8741;X3e0102413;X3e11b0f57;X3fb3b4441;X496f1caf1;X4ab2d4ef5;X4ca06350a;X56e6eb902;X5d5121731;X60b91feb5;X616ebe6d2;X6219ca39b;X64516f0a4;X6ade536a6;X6b7ebe84a;X85ca6c41b;X87cb85486;X899b6d40a;X8a7c56b55;X8ab31f44d;X90dd774dc;Xa2a3416c0;Xa573c28be;Xa73ec8b50;Xa9630787d;Xb5197acc8;Xbc0bb839a;Xbf3656f18;Xc17f1608d;Xc25e17f3a;Xc7c5c6d5b;Xc9e6a69cf;Xcd799f293;Xd078861bb;Xd63e86c37;Xdb8f1766a;Xe48c743ee;Xeb1d5f9cf;Xf1677bf27;Xf56f47ae2;Xfa3982b83;Xfad7a52e0;Xfb0916b30;Xfe5534078;Xff6d7990e,49,"Advances in Science Visualization: Social Networks, Semantic Maps, and Discursive Knowledge",http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3746,2012

731,"There are different ways in which the authors of a scientific publication can determine the order in which their names are listed. Sometimes author names are simply listed alphabetically. In other cases, authorship order is determined based on the contribution authors have made to a publication. Contribution-based authorship can facilitate proper credit assignment, for instance by giving most credits to the first author. In the case of alphabetical authorship, nothing can be inferred about the relative contribution made by the different authors of a publication. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of the use of alphabetical authorship in scientific publishing. Our analysis covers all fields of science. We find that the use of alphabetical authorship is declining over time. In 2011, the authors of less than 4% of all publications intentionally chose to list their names alphabetically. The use of alphabetical authorship is most common in mathematics, economics (including finance), and high energy physics. Also, the use of alphabetical authorship is relatively more common in the case of publications with either a small or a large number of authors.","Waltman, Ludo",ArXiv e-prints,X0053ee661;X02c970af1;X036625a8f;X050ace3bd;X05f714678;X09347e2a3;X09e9f5297;X0ac59fbb8;X0be6bea2b;X0c32578c5;X116444709;X123562c86;X148fb0fc1;X17d8d8c2d;X195816ca1;X19647ec01;X1d3cc1926;X22f9a9621;X232a70306;X24b05fa4a;X256acb5ea;X2609ef184;X26911d5e6;X2b9178b02;X2d591d312;X2e54e05a3;X30fbb7c64;X34873dbd6;X34f1384ca;X350c3b1c8;X357e75833;X35cb9341d;X36341eea3;X36fc181c3;X37f4c5ea7;X3929bf415;X3c254ddcb;X3d7990b5d;X41c218b97;X44aafb55e;X4598b5d6c;X46dda9059;X480be5136;X4ad8af2b3;X4b0d5cb8f;X50d906423;X511f0f5b7;X535b8a3b0;X55ea03df7;X58db352a4;X5a8967716;X5ad9371d1;X5bf105c43;X5d11e8e6d;X650cf77de;X6805916ac;X6a4f85243;X6b3e91931;X6d5526b41;X6f2ab6fb9;X71e5fe7cb;X75f8c76d1;X7710dd268;X799bd9309;X7bce7b41d;X7c0daba33;X7cd2326d7;X7d6301019;X818743e47;X826deb4af;X84c06f067;X85c08fc80;X8664d518d;X8a25f9639;X8a4e1d75b;X8a99fe93a;X8ad0540db;X8bedb2a20;X8cad26a5b;X8eacea9c2;X959a23f7c;X9672f0778;X972f00399;X9ad58546c;Xa3251349d;Xa3dae98dc;Xa60dd75f8;Xa811b8894;Xaa45ed1bf;Xb4ba68d6e;Xb8d9c88b0;Xbc6ce1533;Xbdb6ed2b3;Xbe028b6de;Xbe531a683;Xbe5e6f319;Xbf1278128;Xc063dc2f7;Xc08098f12;Xc84287529;Xc8fc10ed2;Xccf27cd2c;Xcfb11bbeb;Xcfe1db110;Xd081fcaef;Xd664b8cc8;Xd8369ba55;Xdadc3f5ab;Xdb1789246;Xdf1115511;Xdf50c1c34;Xdf522a55a;Xe00d03a6a;Xe04ba4483;Xe46799866;Xe6c0be845;Xe8d44bbb7;Xeb8326d67;Xec7195739;Xedb6ed783;Xedd4391ec;Xee67b7978;Xef84a4d94;Xf274fb635;Xf40dee16c;Xf61a77d6c;Xf7895d1da;Xfa0e9efce;Xfa5cd97ac;Xffa2713b2,130,An empirical analysis of the use of alphabetical authorship in scientific publishing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4863,2012

734,"Several important and unique experimental high-energy physics programmes at a variety of facilities are coming to an end, including those at HERA, the B-factories and the Tevatron. The wealth of physics data from these experiments is the result of a significant financial and human effort, and yet until recently no coherent strategy existed for data preservation and re-use. To address this issue, an inter-experimental study group on data preservation and long-term analysis in high-energy physics was convened at the end of 2008, publishing an interim report in 2009. The membership of the study group has since expanded, including the addition of the LHC experiments, and a full status report has now been released. This report greatly expands on the ideas contained in the original publication and provides a more solid set of recommendations, not only concerning data preservation and its implementation in high-energy physics, but also the future direction and organisational model of the study group. The main messages of the status report were presented for the first time at the 2012 International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics and are summarised in these proceedings.","South, D.

In order to retain the full potential for future improvements, the H1 Collaboration aims for level 4 of the DPHEP recommendations, which requires the full simulation and reconstruction chain as well as the data to be preserved for future analysis. A major goal of the H1 project is therefore to provide secure, long-lived and validated access to the H1 data and analysis software, which is realised in collaboration with DESY-IT using virtualisation techniques. By implementing such a system, it is hoped that the lifetime of the unique ep collision data from HERA will be extended, providing the possibility for novel analysis in the future. The preservation of the data and software is performed alongside a consolidation programme of digital and non-digital documentation, some of which dates back to the early 1980s. A new organisational model of the H1 Collaboration, reflecting the change to the long term phase, is to be adopted in July 2012.","South, D.

The focus of this research is to determine whether science fiction is primarily English speaking and Western or global; being created and consumed by people in non-Western, non-English speaking countries? Science fiction's international presence was found in three ways, by network analysis, by examining a online retailer and with a survey. Condor, a program developed by GalaxyAdvisors was used to determine if science fiction is being talked about by non-English speakers. An analysis of the international Amazon.com websites was done to discover if it was being consumed worldwide. A survey was also conducted to see if people had experience with science fiction. All three research methods revealed similar results. Science fiction was found to be international, with science fiction creators originating in different countries and writing in a host of different languages.

739,"In previous work we reported that resources linked in tweets disappeared at the rate of 11% in the first year followed by 7.3% each year afterwards. We also found that in the first year 6.7%, and 14.6% in each subsequent year, of the resources were archived in public web archives. In this paper we revisit the same dataset of tweets and find that our prior model still holds and the calculated error for estimating percentages missing was about 4%, but we found the rate of archiving produced a higher error of about 11.5%. We also discovered that resources have disappeared from the archives themselves (7.89%) as well as reappeared on the live web after being declared missing (6.54%). We have also tested the availability of the tweets themselves and found that 10.34% have disappeared from the live web. To mitigate the loss of resources on the live web, we propose the use of a ""tweet signature"". Using the Topsy API, we extract the top five most frequent terms from the union of all tweets about a resource, and use these five terms as a query to Google. We found that using tweet signatures results in discovering replacement resources with 70+% textual similarity to the missing resource 41% of the time.","SalahEldeen, Hany M.;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X022f37ea1;X09ad954ac;X0ff0d1f17;X133b7182a;X1e32c1983;X262b07104;X30493cd2c;X465556c35;X586bb004d;X60a1d83dc;X6d83fa608;X8063ea673;X8dbb97f50;X98238ba37;X9b24df573;X9c1a2a93f;X9f1409357;Xa70ee2c98;Xae97ded41;Xb3083d556;Xb3503a869;Xbb7f5dfaa;Xbd5a53673;Xc2fff1b33;Xc914f3c45;Xd37f91382;Xe576031b7;Xfcc1e3885,28,Resurrecting My Revolution: Using Social Link Neighborhood in Bringing Context to the Disappearing Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2648,2013
740,"Shared reference is an essential aspect of meaning. It is also indispensable for the semantic web, since it enables to weave the global graph, i.e., it allows different users to contribute to an identical referent. For example, an essential kind of referent is a geographic place, to which users may contribute observations. We argue for a human-centric, operational approach towards reference, based on respective human competences. These competences encompass perceptual, cognitive as well as technical ones, and together they allow humans to inter-subjectively refer to a phenomenon in their environment. The technology stack of the semantic web should be extended by such operations. This would allow establishing new kinds of observation-based reference systems that help constrain and integrate the semantic web bottom-up.","Scheider, Simon;Janowicz, Krzysztof;Adams, Benjamin",ArXiv e-prints,X2580b344d;X26b91c329;X28b4baf59;Xbbc32c05d;Xc76ad0775;Xf21823188,6,The observational roots of reference of the semantic web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6347,2012

742,"Assessing the impact of astronomical facilities rests upon an evaluation of the scientic discoveries which their data have enabled. Telescope bibliographies, which link data products with the literature, provide a way to use bibliometrics as an impact measure for the underlying observations. In this paper we argue that the creation and maintenance of telescope bibliographies should be considered an integral part of an observatory's operations. We review the existing tools, services, and work ows which support these curation activities, giving an estimate of the eort and expertise required to maintain an archive-based telescope bibliography.","Accomazzi, Alberto;Henneken, Edwin;Erdmann, Christopher;Rots, Arnold",Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Conference Series,4201071e72;54e84f48c5;55369f9a1d;X205e01bf6;X4c54e740f;X6607ab402;X6c22c1843;X864da676c;Xa60ea3d3b;Xb09e40e27;Xba88f1f44;Xca4874172;Xddef15c98,13,Telescope bibliographies: an essential component of archival data management and operations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6352,2012
743,"Rather than ""measuring"" a scientist impact through the number of citations which his/her published work can have generated, isn't it more appropriate to consider his/her value through his/her scientific network performance illustrated by his/her co-author role, thus focussing on his/her joint publications, - and their impact through citations? Whence, on one hand, this paper very briefly examines bibliometric laws, like the $h$-index and subsequent debate about co-authorship effects, but on the other hand, proposes a measure of collaborative work through a new index. Based on data about the publication output of a specific research group, a new bibliometric law is found. Let a co-author $C$ have written $J$ (joint) publications with one or several colleagues. Rank all the co-authors of that individual according to their number of joint publications, giving a rank $r$ to each co-author, starting with $r=1$ for the most prolific. It is empirically found that a very simple relationship holds between the number of joint publications $J$ by coauthors and their rank of importance, i.e. $J \propto 1/r$. Thereafter, in the same spirit as for the Hirsch core, one can define a ""co-author core"", and introduce indices operating on an author. It is emphasized that the new index has a quite different (philosophical) perspective that the $h$-index. In the present case, one focusses on ""relevant"" persons rather than on ""relevant"" publications. Although the numerical discussion is based on one case, there is little doubt that the law can be verified in many other situations. Therefore, variants and generalizations could be later produced in order to quantify co-author roles, in a temporary or long lasting stable team(s), and lead to criteria about funding, career measurements or even induce career strategies.","Ausloos, Marcel",ArXiv e-prints,X0e633f694;X161d96a58;X1e80dc089;X2260f352b;X2bb186016;X2c3fce2a9;X40017beb6;X47719bde4;X4ff79da36;X50cd743f2;X53b926103;X6e69708cf;X76349e296;X8359548ee;Xa3f0e8eba;Xa6b0e234d;Xc118e0e26;Xc3a9c0808;Xdda241ed4;Xeef04a9d9,20,A scientometrics law about co-authors and their ranking.

This paper describes an approach to integrated inference for extraction and coreference based on conditionally-trained undirected graphical models. We discuss the advantages of conditional probability training, and of a coreference model structure based on graph partitioning. On a data set of research paper citations, we show significant reduction in error by using extraction uncertainty to improve coreference citation matching accuracy, and using coreference to improve the accuracy of the extracted fields.","Wellner, Ben;McCallum, Andrew;Peng, Fuchun;Hay, Michael",ArXiv e-prints,X32deba8b2;X62445b6cb;X6b5c785fd;X74cce6577;X795eac02a;Xa1d7b19e8;Xadafcb5cb;Xc23c66c02;Xc3d0e9fbe;Xd54a1ef78;Xf43de10d9,11,"An Integrated, Conditional Model of Information Extraction and Coreference with Applications to Citation Matching",http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4157,2012

The individual $h$-index is strongly correlated with the square root of the total citations $N_C$: $h \approx 0.53 \sqrt{N_C}$. For academic ages ranging from 12 to 24 years, the distribution of the time scaled index $h/\sqrt{A_A}$ is approximately time-independent and it is well described by the Gompertz function. The time scaled index $h/\sqrt{A_A}$ has an average approximately equal to 3.8 and a standard deviation approximately equal to 1.6. Finally, the time scaled index $h/\sqrt{A_A}$ appears to be strongly correlated with the contemporary $h$-index $h_c$.","Mannella, Riccardo;Rossi, Paolo",ArXiv e-prints,X140bf4422;X1e8614d92;X21a90dd55;X26458c432;X39acf7a59;X4390dead2;Xc433d6f75;Xd62b2b90f,8,On the time dependence of the $h$-index,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3499,2012
747,"The project which led to this report was funded by JISC in 2010--2011 as part of its 'Managing Research Data' programme, to examine the way in which Big Science data is managed, and produce any recommendations which may be appropriate. Big science data is different: it comes in large volumes, and it is shared and exploited in ways which may differ from other disciplines. This project has explored these differences using as a case-study Gravitational Wave data generated by the LSC, and has produced recommendations intended to be useful variously to JISC, the funding council (STFC) and the LSC community. In Sect. 1 we define what we mean by 'big science', describe the overall data culture there, laying stress on how it necessarily or contingently differs from other disciplines. In Sect. 2 we discuss the benefits of a formal data-preservation strategy, and the cases for open data and for well-preserved data that follow from that. This leads to our recommendations that, in essence, funders should adopt rather light-touch prescriptions regarding data preservation planning: normal data management practice, in the areas under study, corresponds to notably good practice in most other areas, so that the only change we suggest is to make this planning more formal, which makes it more easily auditable, and more amenable to constructive criticism. In Sect. 3 we briefly discuss the LIGO data management plan, and pull together whatever information is available on the estimation of digital preservation costs. The report is informed, throughout, by the OAIS reference model for an open archive.","Gray, Norman;Carozzi, Tobia;Woan, Graham",ArXiv e-prints,X01d9a8f15;X066efb484;X098a77aad;X0d26990dd;X175d2f91d;X2347d0854;X2a5a98c32;X2d7333ef5;X31f8fedc6;X321afe71a;X358ded770;X35f031a9a;X403513c65;X47118ca2d;X4b6cb1b84;X4e4be3875;X4fb8d6e08;X54f74b5e9;X5655beba8;X5f9607489;X60af20a37;X65a7e0b26;X6627ebe36;X664ea2547;X670dcdcaa;X68e169ca4;X6ed9dca8f;X6f70af1b7;X7851f8e85;X78f3f1285;X82d26ae85;X8565f9b00;X87400eaf8;X882099dce;X8f546fb94;X9894090bc;X98ff1ca62;X9a68e8b17;Xa4be958ce;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xadd704ea2;Xae582a4c1;Xb18a40531;Xb19f34dbf;Xb38b0a8ac;Xb40dc0687;Xb687dd025;Xb6fc8f8a3;Xb8aaffa6f;Xc433d6f75;Xc54e7f700;Xc5a5ab9e3;Xd0b0ce986;Xd4cef2813;Xd8d60ede5;Xe2c858a24;Xe4706134e;Xea594c56b;Xec48a29e0;Xf434ad2c2;Xf52efcf4f;Xf5a83abcf;Xf959e818c;Xfdf3fada9,64,Managing Research Data in Big Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3923,2012
748,"This study provides quantitative evidence on how the use of journal rankings can disadvantage interdisciplinary research in research evaluations. Using publication and citation data, it compares the degree of interdisciplinarity and the research performance of a number of Innovation Studies units with that of leading Business & Management schools in the UK. On the basis of various mappings and metrics, this study shows that: (i) Innovation Studies units are consistently more interdisciplinary in their research than Business & Management schools; (ii) the top journals in the Association of Business Schools' rankings span a less diverse set of disciplines than lower-ranked journals; (iii) this results in a more favourable assessment of the performance of Business & Management schools, which are more disciplinary-focused. This citation-based analysis challenges the journal ranking-based assessment. In short, the investigation illustrates how ostensibly 'excellence-based' journal rankings exhibit a systematic bias in favour of mono-disciplinary research. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications of these phenomena, in particular how the bias is likely to affect negatively the evaluation and associated financial resourcing of interdisciplinary research organisations, and may result in researchers becoming more compliant with disciplinary authority over time.","Rafols, Ismael;Leydesdorff, Loet;O'Hare, Alice;Nightingale, Paul;Stirling, Andy",ArXiv e-prints,55467316aa;X00f79a919;X022e150c6;X06b750084;X06b7d808f;X0c4fc62a8;X0fb7c4410;X1261a81ee;X15d9d0546;X170d313ab;X198a0df0d;X19f46f1f4;X1d1a1f379;X1de78096b;X213f4f8e8;X21b3eda91;X2e5b137c7;X2e738fda5;X31fff79b0;X3450ec3dc;X34d28859d;X34e3f2efc;X38d0a1927;X39f227fa9;X3abdb10ae;X3bc9a87f9;X3c10c77d5;X3c57f5d37;X3ebb18fd8;X403aec0b5;X404686f61;X41e058bb7;X46bbf61d9;X4948a03e0;X4d1375428;X4ded0edb3;X510400d0e;X55270b966;X59c0e811f;X5e1509c67;X63c2e2142;X67b95a961;X68efdf2b9;X6ca30ad7e;X6cdcc140f;X792c1fc52;X7cf22e1f3;X7da5285a7;X88a9dfc40;X94701fa85;X9890b6195;X995412727;X9b53fe00f;Xa1b994b71;Xa1dd52a73;Xa3898cd8b;Xa3ce0487f;Xa6266646e;Xa74b09aa4;Xa89210bc0;Xaaffd7c99;Xaf026f528;Xb1b66f205;Xb38edbb17;Xb76c94143;Xb90b1c181;Xc43f9ab97;Xc4a828d2e;Xc60597252;Xc6a143e77;Xca800fb0e;Xca93aaa72;Xcd797bd41;Xcf268fc54;Xcf2e9cc27;Xd3f83e16a;Xdbda036ca;Xdc0362e63;Xdf54afe8f;Xe3e059de2;Xe3e18cb7e;Xe81c8ba05;Xeaab46fc9;Xec5e4f59b;Xef3800cb2;Xf03ac0070;Xf17b806e1;Xf37f3b68b;Xf3e76ed91;Xf51f59fbb;Xff1610fdf,91,How journal rankings can suppress interdisciplinary research.

The information from interviews and relative data revealed that both Superstar and Sursen have serious copyright infringement which is an important problem impeding the further development of the eBook market. The questionnaire explored awareness, purchase, reading and other experiences of eBook end-users. Questions indicated that readers were attracted by the technical advantages including costless to copy, easy to transfer, searchable and easy to store, but did not want to pay for eBooks. Because the computers, especially desktop PCs, were the main device for reading and the CRT displays were massive used while there were few dedicated reading device in the market, many eBook end-users still preferred to read extended passages of text on papers rather than screens. Today the copyrights issue, user acceptance and the reading device are three significant obstacles for eBook industry in China.","Shen, Liang",ArXiv e-prints,X00e75f766;X0492ca181;X0b4e3e89e;X0c80feccb;X1c6012a45;X227f24915;X2281073ab;X28a332df6;X2915f1a03;X2c0e94bef;X2cbd52110;X384c754d2;X3cb657ba5;X3d60c1ba9;X3f208e043;X40d8d885d;X416788ba1;X45bda380f;X4b2cfe67f;X4d29152cd;X4e450d35c;X4f58a03c5;X4fa07d87a;X4fcf27729;X5420b81d1;X662a40c78;X66ae5cb9e;X6a0b10c3b;X7a02c5d58;X7c36ebb34;X7e8b95530;X7f95bf70d;X8207c723c;X8733e2a6e;X8bff7bcdf;X8c5ca9a95;X997e2cdb3;Xa1a952279;Xaa93d331d;Xac3f42cc1;Xb0881b9c5;Xb13a73abc;Xb71d8cbda;Xb8d0d8ee3;Xbad2a48b5;Xbd6506daa;Xd383ea054;Xd4174e8e7;Xd98dc121b;Xdb95117c7;Xdf0d828ac;Xe072597e4;Xe111830f0;Xe998a58d5;Xec0799d07;Xf0a3c194b;Xf11ef6c36;Xf121b4a36;Xf39517ffc;Xf49504b95,60,Developments and Obstacles in Chinese eBook Market,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3964,2012
750,"ECML PKDD is the main European conference on machine learning and data mining. Since its foundation it implemented the publication model common in computer science: there was one conference deadline; conference submissions were reviewed by a program committee; papers were accepted with a low acceptance rate. Proceedings were published in several Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial (LNAI) volumes, while selected papers were invited to special issues of the Machine Learning and Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery journals. In recent years, this model has however come under stress. Problems include: reviews are of highly variable quality; the purpose of bringing the community together is lost; reviewing workloads are high; the information content of conferences and journals decreases; there is confusion among scientists in interdisciplinary contexts. In this paper, we present a new publication model, which will be adopted for the ECML PKDD 2013 conference, and aims to solve some of the problems of the traditional model. The key feature of this model is the creation of a journal track, which is open to submissions all year long and allows for revision cycles.","Blockeel, Hendrik;Kersting, Kristian;Nijssen, Siegfried;Zelezny, Filip",ArXiv e-prints,550c54f1fb;X064c6949f;X0e7d1f693;X128aac026;X1932e8e8e;X1a6b7a400;X251137045;X2876d7d44;X2c0550829;X40fa69bbe;X48f3ed594;X57d30f73a;X5c13e6370;X63e8d2422;X6607600bd;X6816f91d0;X68951ba7a;X73d5adeb0;X7f229280b;X856831a6e;X8b86b7577;X8f6f3b2aa;X99b3a7c01;X99dc36e52;X9ad60ef2e;X9f1ce7bbf;Xa70353f50;Xa736b2590;Xaac089888;Xac0d7bd3e;Xb10328fd9;Xb6505a060;Xb6863f39e;Xbcfa6332f;Xbdc1f67d3;Xc631a9416;Xcb857dfe6;Xd0777ddc9;Xd4b552706;Xd7a722b85;Xde50dbf05;Xdf0ef2563;Xdfd9a308d;Xf1d038db5;Xf8155cb0a;Xf828343d9,46,A Revised Publication Model for ECML PKDD,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6324,2012
751,"Bibliometric indexes are customary used in evaluating the impact of scientific research, even though it is very well known that in different research areas they may range in very different intervals. Sometimes, this is evident even within a single given field of investigation making very difficult (and inaccurate) the assessment of scientific papers. On the other hand, the problem can be recast in the same framework which has allowed to efficiently cope with the ordering of web-pages, i.e., to formulate the PageRank of Google. For this reason, we call such problem the PaperRank problem, here solved by using a similar approach to that employed by PageRank. The obtained solution, which is mathematically grounded, will be used to compare the usual heuristics of the number of citations with a new one here proposed. Some numerical tests show that the new heuristics is much more reliable than the currently used ones, based on the bare number of citations.

754,"The history of the occupations ""author"" and ""photographer"" provides an insightful perspective on copyright and creativity. The concept of the romantic author, associated with personal creative genius, gained prominence in the eighteenth century. However, in the U.S. in 1900 only about three thousand persons professed their occupation to be ""author."" Self-professed ""photographers"" were then about ten times as numerous as authors. Being a photographer was associated with manufacturing and depended only on mastering technical skills and making a living. Being an author, in contrast, was an elite status associated with science and literature. Across the twentieth century, the number of writers and authors grew much more rapidly than the number of photographers. The relative success of writers and authors in creating jobs seems to have depended not on differences in copyright or possibilities for self-production, but on greater occupational innovation. Creativity in organizing daily work is an important form of creativity.","Galbi, Douglas A.",ArXiv e-prints,X06d4e3293;X158e1754e;X3bedc8c50;X5bf3a28e4;Xe25f1af81,5,Copyright and Creativity: Authors and Photographers,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0311054,2003
755,"This study presents the basic lines of electronic administration in Spain. The complexity of the Spanish political-administrative system makes such a study challenging, in view of the considerable degree of autonomy and competences of the regional administrative bodies and local agencies with respect to the central government, the former being more visible in the 17 regions of Spain. Nonetheless, the central government maintains a series of legal instruments that allow a certain common framework of action to be imposed, aside from what is put into effect through diverse programs aimed precisely to develop common tools for the regions and municipalities of Spain. After an introduction that provides some necessary background, this study describes the legislative framework in which Spain's electronic administrative system has developed. The data included in the study refer to investment in information and communication technologies (ICT) and the services offered by the different Administrations on the internet; internet access by citizens, homes, businesses, and employees, as well as the interactivity existing with administrations by means of the internet; the origins and rise of various political initiatives of the Central Government involving electronic administration; and finally, the situation of civil service personnel, as catalysts of the success of Information Society in the Public Administration within Spain.","Munoz-Canavate, Antonio;Hipola, Pedro",ArXiv e-prints,54dd33816c;X04d7a5df8;X07720317f;X07c6e13de;X0f366624c;X120139485;X25d60accb;X34a699b95;X4152b0976;X53381b780;X55cf42030;X5921dbfdb;X8cc34742c;X91a414357;X9a7891770;X9f47f8bdf;Xb23fead6b;Xcceb08ea4;Xcf0762fe1;Xd7bd3deea;Xe69769f7c;Xeaa7baf5b;Xf2b8d91cd,23,Electronic administration in Spain: from its beginnings to the present,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0259,2012

757,"Using the database of the PuertoTerm project, an indexing system based on the cognitive model of Brigitte Enders was built. By analyzing the cognitive strategies of three abstractors, we built an automat that serves to simulate human indexing processes. The automat allows the texts integrated in the system to be assessed, evaluated and grouped by means of the bipartite spectral graph partitioning algorithm, which also permits visualization of the terms and the documents. The system features an ontology and a database to enhance its operativity. As a result of the application, we achieved better rates of exhaustivity in the indexing of documents, as well as greater precision and retrieval of information, with high levels of efficiency.","Leiva-Mederos, Amed;Senso, Jose A.;Dominguez-Velasco, Sandor;Hipola, Pedro",ArXiv e-prints,X71b609480;X7fcb64047;X8ee2c7184;Xc4b215b20;Xe4c97fe28,5,An Automat for the Semantic Processing of Structured Information,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0359,2012
758,"In recent years, Semantic web has become a topic of active research in several fields of computer science and has applied in a wide range of domains such as bioinformatics, life sciences, and knowledge management. The two fast-developing research areas semantic web and web mining can complement each other and their different techniques can be used jointly or separately to solve the issues in both areas. In addition, since shifting from current web to semantic web mainly depends on the enhancement of knowledge, web mining can play a key role in facing numerous challenges of this changing. In this paper, we analyze and classify the application of divers web mining techniques in different challenges of the semantic web in form of an analytical framework.","Hassanzadeh, Hamed;Keyvanpour, Mohammad Reza",ArXiv e-prints,X076b09f89;X07ee741e5;X1d3303ef1;X1e7c9098f;X2945dcece;X36bc06791;X37206498f;X3abea341b;X4519d8b92;X574a69bb6;X64eb5ee10;X6b18e8c58;X8170a91a3;X83647d150;X839937b2c;X86a92e04d;X98e082180;X9f3f4faa8;Xa03bec809;Xaba4614ab;Xb7c117544;Xbec9fe124;Xc91888512;Xe3ff27609;Xec4cb92e0;Xec70d4851,26,Semantic Web Requirements through Web Mining Techniques,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0690,2012

762,"A new method for visualizing the relatedness of scientific areas is developed that is based on measuring the overlap of researchers between areas. It is found that closely related areas have a high propensity to share a larger number of common authors. A methodology for comparing areas of vastly different sizes and to handle name homonymy is constructed, allowing for the robust deployment of this method on real data sets. A statistical analysis of the probability distributions of the common author overlap that accounts for noise is carried out along with the production of network maps with weighted links proportional to the overlap strength. This is demonstrated on two case studies, complexity science and neutrino physics, where the level of relatedness of areas within each area is expected to vary greatly. It is found that the results returned by this method closely match the intuitive expectation that the broad, multidisciplinary area of complexity science possesses areas that are weakly related to each other while the much narrower area of neutrino physics shows very strongly related areas.","Serpa, F.

763,"The New York Public Library is participating in the Chronicling America initiative to develop an online searchable database of historically significant newspaper articles. Microfilm copies of the newspapers are scanned and high resolution Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software is run on them. The text from the OCR provides a wealth of data and opinion for researchers and historians. However, categorization of articles provided by the OCR engine is rudimentary and a large number of the articles are labeled editorial without further grouping. Manually sorting articles into fine-grained categories is time consuming if not impossible given the size of the corpus. This paper studies techniques for automatic categorization of newspaper articles so as to enhance search and retrieval on the archive. We explore unsupervised (e.g. KMeans) and semi-supervised (e.g. constrained clustering) learning algorithms to develop article categorization schemes geared towards the needs of end-users. A pilot study was designed to understand whether there was unanimous agreement amongst patrons regarding how articles can be categorized. It was found that the task was very subjective and consequently automated algorithms that could deal with subjective labels were used. While the small scale pilot study was extremely helpful in designing machine learning algorithms, a much larger system needs to be developed to collect annotations from users of the archive. The ""BODHI"" system currently being developed is a step in that direction, allowing users to correct wrongly scanned OCR and providing keywords and tags for newspaper articles used frequently. On successful implementation of the beta version of this system, we hope that it can be integrated with existing software being developed for the Chronicling America project.","Dutta, Haimonti;Chan, William;Shankargouda, Deepak;Pooleery, Manoj;Radeva, Axinia;Rego, Kyle;Xie, Boyi;Passonneau, Rebecca;Lee, Austin;Taranto, Barbara",ArXiv e-prints,X0d1938e3a;X32e11b1d0;X6310b8fdd;X67a491dd4;X6d2e01660;X733ffb119;X91f714a7b;Xa44271ed3;Xaa6720edb;Xae53384d8;Xb5c8db97d;Xbc211a2a6;Xc9b80b73f;Xd78c7781e;Xdd74e7937,15,Leveraging Subjective Human Annotation for Clustering Historic Newspaper Articles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3530,2012
764,"When eliciting opinions from a group of experts, traditional devices used to promote honest reporting assume that there is an observable future outcome. In practice, however, this assumption is not always reasonable. In this paper, we propose a scoring method built on strictly proper scoring rules to induce honest reporting without assuming observable outcomes. Our method provides scores based on pairwise comparisons between the reports made by each pair of experts in the group. For ease of exposition, we introduce our scoring method by illustrating its application to the peer-review process. In order to do so, we start by modeling the peer-review process using a Bayesian model where the uncertainty regarding the quality of the manuscript is taken into account. Thereafter, we introduce our scoring method to evaluate the reported reviews. Under the assumptions that reviewers are Bayesian decision-makers and that they cannot influence the reviews of other reviewers, we show that risk-neutral reviewers strictly maximize their expected scores by honestly disclosing their reviews. We also show how the group's scores can be used to find a consensual review. Experimental results show that encouraging honest reporting through the proposed scoring method creates more accurate reviews than the traditional peer-review process.","Carvalho, Arthur;Dimitrov, Stanko;Larson, Kate",ArXiv e-prints,X0272ad899;X05966c92e;X0fd102280;X206f62660;X2b28eb7ec;X31b74f6a8;X390d78673;X4819583c5;X4c17360c5;X5f824737a;X5ff20e822;Xa96b18625;Xb76f232e8;Xb78624e91;Xc022645f4;Xd3c45bc26;Xd6f3f047a;Xd8472558d;Xf7f4e0440;Xfb00c2a0b;Xfb6d1e9c1,21,Inducing Honest Reporting Without Observing Outcomes: An Application to the Peer-Review Process,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3197,2013

766,"Different scientific fields have different citation practices. Citation-based bibliometric indicators need to normalize for such differences between fields in order to allow for meaningful between-field comparisons of citation impact. Traditionally, normalization for field differences has usually been done based on a field classification system. In this approach, each publication belongs to one or more fields and the citation impact of a publication is calculated relative to the other publications in the same field. Recently, the idea of source normalization was introduced, which offers an alternative approach to normalize for field differences. In this approach, normalization is done by looking at the referencing behavior of citing publications or citing journals. In this paper, we provide an overview of a number of source normalization approaches and we empirically compare these approaches with a traditional normalization approach based on a field classification system. We also pay attention to the issue of the selection of the journals to be included in a normalization for field differences. Our analysis indicates a number of problems of the traditional classification-system-based normalization approach, suggesting that source normalization approaches may yield more accurate results.","Waltman, Ludo;van Eck, Nees Jan",ArXiv e-prints,X00645a85c;X02aa453d8;X0daf0ffbf;X0f191c6cf;X169a82678;X1882ec132;X1d524ee7e;X1fe7148b5;X25db0ffdc;X2a33181d3;X2b2544bd2;X2ce12da9b;X380d11e17;X3d32f5cba;X3dbbe27ae;X55a7d70c9;X55ff57b1c;X56ec5b4d8;X5891891ba;X5c5e770d0;X5df479f21;X60b08f912;X64d4f135e;X6513e904e;X6520d43bd;X67defd867;X6df6bc8b2;X6e837321f;X73d4a43e9;X7408a9987;X7668464ed;X76f335d88;X79141b5ed;X7b7e8674b;X7d91af924;X7e9a514c5;X7fe2a12a6;X8e509506e;X912d21855;X94000e6f2;X94ba7afb2;X94e2c59ab;X9b004f9bd;Xa19a3d80f;Xa1b994b71;Xad214eb69;Xb1595a9d5;Xb3fb3c7f3;Xbc0bb839a;Xc09333151;Xc8896d096;Xcb7c97e82;Xdd74e7937;Xde76b7f0a;Xf3de84e97;Xf8663f239;Xfbf8513b2,57,Source normalized indicators of citation impact: An overview of different approaches and an empirical comparison,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6122,2012
767,"The amount of electronic documents in the Internet grows very quickly. How to effectively identify subjects for documents becomes an important issue. In past, the researches focus on the behavior of nouns in documents. Although subjects are composed of nouns, the constituents that determine which nouns are subjects are not only nouns. Based on the assumption that texts are well-organized and event-driven, nouns and verbs together contribute the process of subject identification. This paper considers four factors: 1) word importance, 2) word frequency, 3) word co-occurrence, and 4) word distance and proposes a model to identify subjects for textual documents. The preliminary experiments show that the performance of the proposed model is close to that of human beings.","Chen, Kuang-hua",ArXiv e-prints,X4a7743cb5;X63064a668;X8ae9aa57c;X8bc89facd,4,Automatic Identification of Subjects for Textual Documents in Digital Libraries,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902002,1999

Traditional scientific research reports are yielding to interactive documents which expose their internal structure and are richly linked to other materials. In these changes, there are opportunities to take advantage of the structure in scientific research reports which previously have not been systematically captured. Thus, we explore ways of capturing more of the structure of research in reports about the research and we use that structure to support the development of a new generation of document browsers which include novel interaction widgets. We apply the browsers incorporating the conceptual modeling framework to full-text research reports from the Public Library of Science (PLoS).

770,"Nobel Prizes are commonly seen to be among the most prestigious achievements of our times. Based on mining several million citations, we quantitatively analyze the processes driving paradigm shifts in science. We find that groundbreaking discoveries of Nobel Prize Laureates and other famous scientists are not only acknowledged by many citations of their landmark papers. Surprisingly, they also boost the citation rates of their previous publications. Given that innovations must outcompete the rich-gets-richer effect for scientific citations, it turns out that they can make their way only through citation cascades. A quantitative analysis reveals how and why they happen. Science appears to behave like a self-organized critical system, in which citation cascades of all sizes occur, from continuous scientific progress all the way up to scientific revolutions, which change the way we see our world. Measuring the ""boosting effect"" of landmark papers, our analysis reveals how new ideas and new players can make their way and finally triumph in a world dominated by established paradigms. The underlying ""boost factor"" is also useful to discover scientific breakthroughs and talents much earlier than through classical citation analysis, which by now has become a widespread method to measure scientific excellence, influencing scientific careers and the distribution of research funds. Our findings reveal patterns of collective social behavior, which are also interesting from an attention economics perspective. Understanding the origin of scientific authority may therefore ultimately help to explain, how social influence comes about and why the value of goods depends so strongly on the attention they attract.","Mazloumian, Amin;Eom, Young-Ho;Helbing, Dirk;Lozano, Sergi;Fortunato, Santo",PLoS ONE,,0,How Citation Boosts Promote Scientific Paradigm Shifts and Nobel Prizes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1917,2011

772,"The SNIP (source normalized impact per paper) indicator is an indicator of the citation impact of scientific journals. The indicator, introduced by Henk Moed in 2010, is included in Elsevier's Scopus database. The SNIP indicator uses a source normalized approach to correct for differences in citation practices between scientific fields. The strength of this approach is that it does not require a field classification system in which the boundaries of fields are explicitly defined. In this paper, a number of modifications that will be made to the SNIP indicator are explained, and the advantages of the resulting revised SNIP indicator are pointed out. It is argued that the original SNIP indicator has some counterintuitive properties, and it is shown mathematically that the revised SNIP indicator does not have these properties. Empirically, the differences between the original SNIP indicator and the revised one turn out to be relatively small, although some systematic differences can be observed. Relations with other source normalized indicators proposed in the literature are discussed as well.","Waltman, Ludo;van Eck, Nees Jan;van Leeuwen, Thed N.;Visser, Martijn S.",ArXiv e-prints,X064d9c02d;X0c969299c;X11d8cb8e3;X155be70e2;X1d90e9973;X338d05d5b;X3762a024e;X3d0ee7151;X4036940d2;X4263cb484;X45da3f6bb;X4a3e92645;X539f33979;X5e740fa7b;X60ce60346;X6223d3cc6;X6b5393307;X6d401a5eb;X72206ea34;X75ae9ac0a;X85091d8f0;X874dea9e4;X8c03a86ed;X8e8475fca;X9a14eb4d9;X9a539225b;X9c8e43f43;Xa1b994b71;Xa31ec3676;Xa3b6252f4;Xa5d266d0d;Xa73cf9da6;Xab2205eb5;Xb655cae98;Xb739f61d1;Xb88e26baa;Xc7f61bb6d;Xca5f5cd22;Xce1afae47;Xd3eb820a6;Xda2df683b;Xdea020f9a;Xe04d25006;Xe40294514;Xe7b63682f;Xf73fdf7f5,46,Some modifications to the SNIP journal impact indicator,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0785,2012
773,"Modern information and communication technologies, especially the Internet, have diminished the role of spatial distances and territorial boundaries on the access and transmissibility of information. This has enabled scientists for closer collaboration and internationalization. Nevertheless, geography remains an important factor affecting the dynamics of science. Here we present a systematic analysis of citation and collaboration networks between cities and countries, by assigning papers to the geographic locations of their authors' affiliations. The citation flows as well as the collaboration strengths between cities decrease with the distance between them and follow gravity laws. In addition, the total research impact of a country grows linearly with the amount of national funding for research & development. However, the average impact reveals a peculiar threshold effect: the scientific output of a country may reach an impact larger than the world average only if the country invests more than about 100,000 USD per researcher annually.","Pan, Raj Kumar;Kaski, Kimmo;Fortunato, Santo",Scientific Reports,X10c833095;X1a7e1cef8;X208dc404e;X4ba1391b7;X57bab293e;X5d26a6a30;X8047aa4b8;X863fda346;X8c46bc694;X98ee84b59;Xaf95f0a06;Xb1cc0a94c;Xe20ec1b64;Xe61c609ec;Xe900aa7a2,15,World citation and collaboration networks: uncovering the role of geography in science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0781,2012
774,"The rate at which scholarly literature is being produced has been increasing at approximately 3.5 percent per year for decades. This means that during a typical 40 year career the amount of new literature produced each year increases by a factor of four. The methods scholars use to discover relevant literature must change. Just like everybody else involved in information discovery, scholars are confronted with information overload. Two decades ago, this discovery process essentially consisted of paging through abstract books, talking to colleagues and librarians, and browsing journals. A time-consuming process, which could even be longer if material had to be shipped from elsewhere. Now much of this discovery process is mediated by online scholarly information systems. All these systems are relatively new, and all are still changing. They all share a common goal: to provide their users with access to the literature relevant to their specific needs. To achieve this each system responds to actions by the user by displaying articles which the system judges relevant to the user's current needs. Recently search systems which use particularly sophisticated methodologies to recommend a few specific papers to the user have been called ""recommender systems"". These methods are in line with the current use of the term ""recommender system"" in computer science. We do not adopt this definition, rather we view systems like these as components in a larger whole, which is presented by the scholarly information systems themselves. In what follows we view the recommender system as an aspect of the entire information system; one which combines the massive memory capacities of the machine with the cognitive abilities of the human user to achieve a human-machine synergy.","Kurtz, Michael J.;Henneken, Edwin A.",,5174c8aa52;54b5ac3661;54f54bd48e;54f64f34a4;54f76bf004;551d925756;5527a2e8c4;552bac1d7e;55439f536e;X09e694bcf;X0e207f731;X131aef4a8;X1c0ecc3c8;X1c59a724e;X1f334322f;X2044ea6b4;X22764b6bc;X25bd6525e;X29582186d;X2e4ddaa41;X3116b8c8f;X3516b5303;X471fc699a;X4c57ad757;X5a04023e5;X6599c53c5;X6fa11531a;X72a959d45;X7bd6dcf35;X8f546fb94;X936fd70ac;Xa39a670b8;Xa9ff48e47;Xab88586b1;Xb1fdd8a74;Xc0f07874f;Xc8b6dbca9;Xcb63a796d;Xce33fc03a;Xcea8ab05d;Xd86029bd1;Xdad6086b8;Xdf639ab3c;Xe1a19cdbd;Xe5dc13361,45,Finding and Recommending Scholarly Articles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1318,2014

776,"Scientists of many countries in which English is not the primary language routinely use a variety of manuscript preparation, correction or editing services, a practice that is openly endorsed by many journals and scientific institutions. These services vary tremendously in their scope; at one end there is simple proof-reading, and at the other extreme there is in-depth and extensive peer-reviewing, proposal preparation, statistical analyses, re-writing and co-writing. In this paper, the various types of service are reviewed, along with authorship guidelines, and the question is raised of whether the high-end services surpass most guidelines' criteria for authorship. Three other factors are considered. First, the ease of collaboration possible in the internet era allows multiple iterations between authors and the editing service, so essentially, papers can be co-written. Second, 'editing services' often offer subject-specific experts who comment not only on the language, but interpret and improve scientific content. Third, the trend towards heavily multi-authored papers implies that the threshold necessary to earn authorship is declining. The inevitable conclusion is that at some point the contributions by 'editing services' should be deemed sufficient to warrant authorship. Trying to enforce any guidelines would likely be futile, but nevertheless, it might be time to revisit the ethics of using some of the high-end 'editing services'. In an increasingly international job market, recognizing this problem might prove progressively more important in authorship disputes, the allocation of research grants, and hiring decisions","Lozano, George A.",ArXiv e-prints,X07bbe0aa2;X07d1dd6ad;X08c862cd2;X0cca2d2d8;X1338f9f7b;X16784a5ef;X19c920485;X1ea8a7208;X1f4232835;X1fb3248b2;X2381e9ac1;X23d756c68;X25f460580;X260a59d54;X2678b6822;X2bfa3ec91;X2cd954196;X3152e7afc;X315cb814c;X38c415e59;X396f5eced;X39938392b;X3bae553fa;X3e5ee72ad;X3ef5d53b7;X40bed1fba;X426bf4a22;X48aa71f0a;X51f0bb7d0;X52fb62010;X53a65a35d;X54f74b5e9;X5735bda4b;X57c9a7522;X5b0b2739c;X624dc8453;X63a05bb1a;X6597d0b4a;X66c63cb76;X685a64c83;X699344eea;X6f7a1ad6b;X6f96bdf77;X734a1cdaa;X781a22f83;X7aaab3612;X7b19b50fa;X7f346c0bf;X84cc3ee87;X85592a938;X858b8d0b5;X8785c459f;X893970215;X8b7a9b464;X926e29b15;X9501a0e4a;Xa04d0307b;Xa1b994b71;Xa3c4c1209;Xa5641a8bc;Xa8bd7846e;Xaa1c28694;Xafd699ae7;Xb3510f4e7;Xb3c9a1ea6;Xb64a212ce;Xb95ac0559;Xb976f265a;Xba48d1e2f;Xc02687cbf;Xc06dd2c1a;Xc2fa25343;Xc555af188;Xcf4cf1018;Xd54acce0b;Xd584b978a;Xd86ecaf96;Xd96e6a3c5;Xdda486290;Xdefb87556;Xe1a3344a8;Xe3da5e8ff;Xe4510c596;Xea997f8a3;Xec9cd5a48;Xf3f3d563a;Xf5c0d2220;Xfc3d0effe,88,Ethics of using language editing services in an era of digital communication and heavily multiauthored papers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2401,2013
777,"To mine large digital libraries in humanistically meaningful ways, scholars need to divide them by genre. This is a task that classification algorithms are well suited to assist, but they need adjustment to address the specific challenges of this domain. Digital libraries pose two problems of scale not usually found in the article datasets used to test these algorithms. 1) Because libraries span several centuries, the genres being identified may change gradually across the time axis. 2) Because volumes are much longer than articles, they tend to be internally heterogeneous, and the classification task needs to begin with segmentation. We describe a multi-layered solution that trains hidden Markov models to segment volumes, and uses ensembles of overlapping classifiers to address historical change. We test this approach on a collection of 469,200 volumes drawn from HathiTrust Digital Library. To demonstrate the humanistic value of these methods, we extract 32,209 volumes of fiction from the digital library, and trace the changing proportions of first- and third-person narration in the corpus. We note that narrative points of view seem to have strong associations with particular themes and genres.","Underwood, Ted;Black, Michael L.;Auvil, Loretta;Capitanu, Boris",ArXiv e-prints,X06aef228e;X1f1b6800c;X2080ae2a0;X2229244c2;X2609524b8;X27bfad980;X2c4d2e510;X2c8732e96;X359c03d95;X385009923;X3dca16ec8;X406b49eaa;X508939e00;X5a3f6d17a;X5dddeec58;X5e4227295;X63c0ace15;X68d67ba65;X6f785dc5d;X73aa45bac;X78d6c882d;X89e41d74c;X8a19e8b55;X8b409f409;X8e2c73bf1;X95605d584;X98119d4b9;X9e6abee78;Xa2b415f0b;Xa7de6e152;Xa82182b97;Xaef9ae75b;Xb2f367cd9;Xb3040917d;Xbc721a6cc;Xcbd1e25f0;Xcbdbea342;Xcd0ae6e89;Xdad64783e;Xdf2026438;Xe0cfcd483;Xe3d1b50a5;Xe6cb9f4b7;Xe94a9b94b;Xec728acbe;Xf212c1960;Xf5aa69e99,47,Mapping Mutable Genres in Structurally Complex Volumes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3323,2013

779,"Conventional Web archives are created by periodically crawling a web site and archiving the responses from the Web server. Although easy to implement and common deployed, this form of archiving typically misses updates and may not be suitable for all preservation scenarios, for example a site that is required (perhaps for records compliance) to keep a copy of all pages it has served. In contrast, transactional archives work in conjunction with a Web server to record all pages that have been served. Los Alamos National Laboratory has developed SiteSory, an open-source transactional archive written in Java solution that runs on Apache Web servers, provides a Memento compatible access interface, and WARC file export features. We used the ApacheBench utility on a pre-release version of to measure response time and content delivery time in different environments and on different machines. The performance tests were designed to determine the feasibility of SiteStory as a production-level solution for high fidelity automatic Web archiving. We found that SiteStory does not significantly affect content server performance when it is performing transactional archiving. Content server performance slows from 0.076 seconds to 0.086 seconds per Web page access when the content server is under load, and from 0.15 seconds to 0.21 seconds when the resource has many embedded and changing resources.","Brunelle, Justin F.;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X143b2a24a;X154b2cb97;X27a254e61;X3ffa72008;X4489e9a13;X563d992d9;X6597ae9c1;X6909385ed;X699ee97d8;X6bfc76615;X7793f5670;X90acbb8c6;X9d8588c10;X9fa9df499;Xc863923e0;Xc895bec51;Xcf967d0dd;Xe8bca3d22;Xef524ff51;Xfa4d65e21;Xfd8f3f9ac,21,Evaluating the SiteStory Transactional Web Archive With the ApacheBench Tool,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1811,2012
780,"Authorship and citation practices evolve with time and differ by academic discipline. As such, indicators of research productivity based on citation records are naturally subject to historical and disciplinary effects. We observe these effects on a corpus of astronomer career data constructed from a database of refereed publications. We employ a simple mechanism to measure research output using author and reference counts available in bibliographic databases to develop a citation-based indicator of research productivity. The total research impact (tori) quantifies, for an individual, the total amount of scholarly work that others have devoted to his/her work, measured in the volume of research papers. A derived measure, the research impact quotient (riq), is an age independent measure of an individual's research ability. We demonstrate that these measures are substantially less vulnerable to temporal debasement and cross-disciplinary bias than the most popular current measures. The proposed measures of research impact, tori and riq, have been implemented in the Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System.","Pepe, Alberto;Kurtz, Michael J.",PLoS ONE,413dc5cd37;51081f9ead;521d90067e;54c127faff;54e780f55b;X04db9b81f;X08f046cdd;X0b4466646;X0d6622bbe;X0d8835461;X0e1047a51;X11ba3ea66;X1bad98107;X1f6441314;X1fc5d26a5;X24475cd66;X245762e66;X267ee1972;X26fd0ad0c;X2b5f1c262;X3062ca364;X381938c57;X3a0b664b9;X432dca82e;X59cb86555;X6e34e7495;X70133249a;X719f84705;X7819d89d0;X7886b1381;X7cebd6e55;X83051e0c5;X849e3d8a5;X87a02aae0;X9461c3e16;X9915620cc;X9b70288de;X9eec06fcd;Xa1b994b71;Xaf2b6e946;Xb3363675e;Xb4211c045;Xb53a4c137;Xb63674ec6;Xb9d9cb802;Xbd1803ce0;Xc4531642f;Xcbdeb5a6e;Xce553d597;Xdad6086b8;Xdccb27760;Xdd74e8e64;Xecc461310;Xf2554aae0;Xf4d85c182,55,A Measure of Total Research Impact Independent of Time and Discipline,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2124,2012
781,"Mathematical knowledge is a central component in science, engineering, and technology (documentation). Most of it is represented informally, and -- in contrast to published research mathematics -- subject to continual change. Unfortunately, machine support for change management has either been very coarse grained and thus barely useful, or restricted to formal languages, where automation is possible. In this paper, we report on an effort to extend change management to collections of semi-formal documents which flexibly intermix mathematical formulas and natural language and to integrate it into a semantic publishing system for mathematical knowledge. We validate the long-standing assumption that the semantic annotations in these flexiformal documents that drive the machine-supported interaction with documents can support semantic impact analyses at the same time. But in contrast to the fully formal setting, where adaptations of impacted documents can be automated to some degree, the flexiformal setting requires much more user interaction and thus a much tighter integration into document management workflows.","Autexier, Serge;David, Catalin;Dietrich, Dominik;Kohlhase, Michael;Zholudev, Vyacheslav",ArXiv e-prints,X0b3e26a84;X0e5f08279;X1dc0eda37;X24ec0a821;X32e991ed5;X579c44ba2;X6b7a809b6;X87b34b86b;X8c1b2ba5d;X9c5031496;Xd97f05818;Xe449fd885;Xe7fcadda0,13,"Workflows for the Management of Change in Science, Technologies, Engineering and Mathematics",http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2392,2011

Unfortunately, the technology for publishing information on the web always outstrips our technology for preservation.

784,"In computer science, conferences and journals conduct peer review in order to decide what to publish. Many have pointed out the inherent weaknesses in peer review, including those of bias, quality, and accountability. Many have suggested and adopted refinements of peer review, for instance, double blind peer review with author rebuttals. In this essay, I argue that peer review as currently practiced conflates the sensible idea of getting comments on a paper with the irrevocably-flawed one that we either accept or reject the paper, which I term gatekeeping. If we look at the two separately, then it is clear that the ills associated with current peer review systems are not due to the practice of getting comments, but due to the practice of gatekeeping. True peer review constitutes my proposal for replacing existing peer review systems. It embraces the idea of open debate on the merits of a paper; however, it rejects unequivocally the exercise of gatekeeping. True peer review offers all the benefits of current peer review systems but has none of its weaknesses. True peer review will lead to a truly engaged community of researchers and therefore better science.","Chopra, Amit K.",ArXiv e-prints,X0c977492c;X134017e4b;X1a8c10384;X24b6fd1f1;X35b354514;X4f5a262a8;X519289c37;X668461bdc;X685a64c83;Xe3e18cb7e;Xe74f27f46;Xed0e43df5,12,True Peer Review,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2807,2012
785,"Social media content has grown exponentially in the recent years and the role of social media has evolved from just narrating life events to actually shaping them. In this paper we explore how many resources shared in social media are still available on the live web or in public web archives. By analyzing six different event-centric datasets of resources shared in social media in the period from June 2009 to March 2012, we found about 11% lost and 20% archived after just a year and an average of 27% lost and 41% archived after two and a half years. Furthermore, we found a nearly linear relationship between time of sharing of the resource and the percentage lost, with a slightly less linear relationship between time of sharing and archiving coverage of the resource. From this model we conclude that after the first year of publishing, nearly 11% of shared resources will be lost and after that we will continue to lose 0.02% per day.","SalahEldeen, Hany M.;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X01d0b15b1;X041593b2e;X07bbe0aa2;X08f1a3841;X0984b2eb2;X09f687a3e;X0ada1cefa;X0bcd8cc22;X0c29ffb76;X0c977492c;X0fac0db83;X14430fd3c;X17cdd4694;X17ea163e3;X194874893;X19db86498;X1a6f98f82;X1aacddc7c;X1c1f7ba02;X1c9e43307;X1d2d82e2d;X1d732b9d8;X1d90e9973;X1ea01b15a;X1f045566c;X203281d33;X2053da1e6;X2413d146d;X264d0e1f5;X271f16011;X27dbf1355;X28ca7e2ad;X2abc108c7;X2b363dc5e;X2baf55aeb;X2bef756b1;X2c593432b;X2dd1f5347;X2fad963fc;X326ee913b;X32da62bf3;X33cf9f5d4;X3561c01c2;X36226aff0;X393604e08;X394f12121;X3acaba943;X3b5955009;X3b6041b44;X3bfbedd42;X3d0ee7151;X400c0e6ce;X4187b23f5;X42af29032;X452c676c0;X454565300;X467ba096e;X46b4e462a;X483d9c15e;X48fa010e2;X4a74e8905;X4bfc12569;X4d90c8f80;X4fba005f9;X5076842b7;X543ffc1f9;X55990a250;X55e2b2118;X55ea507a4;X574fd9087;X57bd720ce;X59bf6b63e;X5a070b9db;X5a31f365f;X5a4016468;X5b8133647;X5c83115ba;X5f2508c14;X6071bc931;X607f8e9ca;X61c1b5bdf;X66fb22e3d;X68395619c;X6a045a10d;X6aeb95471;X6af033fc6;X6d6fc2c93;X6e915df65;X6fe2a7942;X717e2b595;X723ae5bb4;X7278f133e;X74fd1d084;X7515e9b0c;X755efe0ad;X77f71bc3f;X7c32c1e25;X7c769db74;X7e4866e42;X7f39393cb;X803cc2326;X814ae60f8;X82788635c;X86ce23595;X8711d9973;X8737ef4c8;X884609663;X8972ba11a;X899673f92;X89e6ff194;X8e38c37e0;X8ecad0fc0;X90e588427;X9177e04ab;X93e030bac;X94d41a7e7;X95bdf1a64;X981348d7d;X98ee84b59;X9c57d01ec;X9c8e43f43;Xa1102b55e;Xa2d482f1a;Xa5d1989e2;Xa7feef932;Xafb1ed816;Xb255d8d21;Xb36ebe813;Xb5c6ea541;Xb5ca1723a;Xb71e0ed71;Xb9157a9a9;Xb943c9c56;Xbeacbccc7;Xc0391e33b;Xc6c1553a6;Xc77bb352b;Xc7af3279d;Xc92494c55;Xc9898dd7b;Xc9afbdcf3;Xcaad23951;Xcbb6bdf82;Xcd8ef4b92;Xd3b00cfcd;Xd52bb1b27;Xd5f61635b;Xd711e8bda;Xd7f574eaa;Xd801d4b47;Xdfe4a29ad;Xe19d1656e;Xe2180e111;Xe2402ee7e;Xe2d995a88;Xe3290c603;Xe39332865;Xe3d2fb081;Xe85501db4;Xe8eae89fd;Xe9a8295f3;Xead41f9f3;Xebd592b48;Xed6d2dfcf;Xed9103b86;Xefcae3230;Xf1ebbbcb7;Xf3f0db5e9;Xf4c6b439c;Xf5c7f0d04;Xffb420a00,171,Losing My Revolution: How Many Resources Shared on Social Media Have Been Lost?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3026,2012
786,"""Bibliometrics"", ""scientometrics"", ""informetrics"", and ""webometrics"" can all be considered as manifestations of a single research area with similar objectives and methods, which we call ""information metrics"" or iMetrics. This study explores the cognitive and social distinctness of iMetrics with respect to the general information science (IS), focusing on a core of researchers, shared vocabulary and literature/knowledge base. Our analysis investigates the similarities and differences between four document sets. The document sets are drawn from three core journals for iMetrics research (Scientometrics, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, and Journal of Informetrics). We split JASIST into document sets containing iMetrics and general IS articles. The volume of publications in this representation of the specialty has increased rapidly during the last decade. A core of researchers that predominantly focus on iMetrics topics can thus be identified. This core group has developed a shared vocabulary as exhibited in high similarity of title words and one that shares a knowledge base. The research front of this field moves faster than the research front of information science in general, bringing it closer to Price's dream.","Milojević, Staša;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X0130ad4d1;X0c977492c;X11a28a9fa;X22d1907bb;X2e549a112;X2ec6d36dd;X362595914;X3e792542a;X490c92a24;X4ce0b7a79;X5498c30f9;X5b704857f;X61e93bd4f;X6219ca39b;X6b4d19804;X6bbdea456;X6fcd87547;X70aa3bac7;X721357126;X738645145;X73c28f353;X76349e296;X864367d32;X96a215fe3;Xa1b994b71;Xa4c6bd550;Xb06aa336d;Xb2f1366d7;Xb5a15fa0e;Xb9bf8edcb;Xc4063b4d5;Xc54ba6dd1;Xcde083206;Xd05f4d902;Xd1cf1bdc2;Xdbb0ff0b7;Xf381e4948;Xfa8197277;Xfb2269d44,39,Information Metrics (iMetrics): A Research Specialty with a Socio-Cognitive Identity?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3406,2012
787,"In science mapping, bibliographic coupling (BC) has been a standard tool for discovering the cognitive structure of research areas, such as constituent subareas, directions, schools of thought, or paradigms. Modelled as a set of documents, research areas are often sorted into document clusters via BC representing a thematic unit each. In this paper we propose an alternative method called age-sensitive bibliographic coupling: the aim is to enable the standard method to produce historically valid thematic units, that is, to yield document clusters that represent the historical development of the thematic structure of the subject as well. As such, the method is expected to be especially beneficial for investigations on science dynamics and the history of science. We apply the method within a bibliometric study in the modern history of bioscience, addressing the development of a complex, interdisciplinary discourse called the Species Problem.","Soos, Sandor",ArXiv e-prints,X1cf5ef267;X3b7054707;X4e7a951ec;X500e3fc4d;X58b1a6749;X5f62b9fb6;X61171c21f;X62c43997d;X77e435135;X78be21c9c;X811fdf671;X8af6955be;Xa0c327b3d;Xa3251349d;Xb244c7803;Xb248bc2a5;Xb25bdb72e;Xc4ffa59ab;Xc7bd90912;Xcaf3f7ce8,20,Age-sensitive bibliographic coupling with an application in the history of science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3608,2012

790,"The birth and decline of disciplines are critical to science and society. How do scientific disciplines emerge? No quantitative model to date allows us to validate competing theories on the different roles of endogenous processes, such as social collaborations, and exogenous events, such as scientific discoveries. Here we propose an agent-based model in which the evolution of disciplines is guided mainly by social interactions among agents representing scientists. Disciplines emerge from splitting and merging of social communities in a collaboration network. We find that this social model can account for a number of stylized facts about the relationships between disciplines, scholars, and publications. These results provide strong quantitative support for the key role of social interactions in shaping the dynamics of science. While several ``science of science'' theories exist, this is the first account for the emergence of disciplines that is validated on the basis of empirical data.","Sun, Xiaoling;Kaur, Jasleen;Milojević, Staša;Flammini, Alessandro;Menczer, Filippo",Scientific Reports,X0eab81ce2;X12f52890d;X2baf55aeb;X2bec4dc11;X396ad4c23;X3c64a71a5;X53c6b3df1;X5c440fab4;X736d78ef9;X8ecb588bf;X96e763355;X995412727;X9feb5ae2e;Xa1b994b71;Xbb120b58d;Xc1f88a133;Xc2195d0d3;Xcacce7ad2;Xd8e1637c8;Xdaeaef3db;Xe26aae5ac;Xf1c1e2f22;Xf7b521a3c;Xf877ea20c,24,Social Dynamics of Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4950,2013
791,"Comments are special types of publications whose aim is to correct or criticize previously published papers. For this reason, comments are believed to make commented papers less worthy or trusty to the eyes of the scientific community, and thus predestined to have low scientific impact. Here, we show that such belief is not supported by empirical evidence. We consider thirteen major publication outlets in science, and perform systematic comparisons between the citations accumulated by commented and non commented articles. We find that (i) commented papers are, on average, much more cited than non commented papers, and (ii) commented papers are more likely to be among the most cited papers of a journal. Since comments are published soon after criticized papers, comments should be viewed as early indicators of the future impact of criticized papers.","Radicchi, Filippo",Scientific Reports,X07c20c0b2;X0b90108b3;X120139485;X1d54a57b9;X285421fbe;X2dc0798ee;X348814447;X3da6d53b9;X48221d263;X48a935bd2;X4c1b6d5d2;X527d043c7;X5d2f1264f;X632219ca8;X65f6f8ec0;X6974142b8;X73d38ed8a;X74c43a30b;X78141efdd;X8249adb30;X8614c806a;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X9390c77c2;X9dc71f356;Xa14f38f4b;Xafc83bd12;Xb1875d7bd;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xc30e3b9aa;Xc8748143b;Xd011d9c1b;Xd4b29b9d8;Xd69b98c13;Xe2a7cc2ac;Xe5283b6b2;Xf3b223276;Xff47dc274,39,In science “there is no bad publicity”: Papers criticized in comments have high scientific impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4997,2012
792,"The paper introduces scholarly Information Retrieval (IR) as a further dimension that should be considered in the science modeling debate. The IR use case is seen as a validation model of the adequacy of science models in representing and predicting structure and dynamics in science. Particular conceptualizations of scholarly activity and structures in science are used as value-added search services to improve retrieval quality: a co-word model depicting the cognitive structure of a field (used for query expansion), the Bradford law of information concentration, and a model of co-authorship networks (both used for re-ranking search results). An evaluation of the retrieval quality when science model driven services are used turned out that the models proposed actually provide beneficial effects to retrieval quality. From an IR perspective, the models studied are therefore verified as expressive conceptualizations of central phenomena in science. Thus, it could be shown that the IR perspective can significantly contribute to a better understanding of scholarly structures and activities.","Mutschke, Peter;Mayr, Philipp;Schaer, Philipp;Sure, York",ArXiv e-prints,X0e2233956;X194ca5b6f;X1b99e2c48;X281a0dc6b;X2a794c1d2;X396407ff4;X3ec715cf2;X4b0703a92;X4b211b8f8;X580c6c903;X5abb65e96;X649dd9b87;X774cc8bbc;X7c328d18f;Xa1b994b71;Xa7d69d3f2;Xbd6506daa;Xc84461c0b;Xd9b4cfb04;Xda2cb0168;Xdb4f71760,21,Science Models as Value-Added Services for Scholarly Information Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2441,2011
793,"Literature search is arguably one of the most important phases of the academic and non-academic research. The increase in the number of published papers each year makes manual search inefficient and furthermore insufficient. Hence, automatized methods such as search engines have been of interest in the last thirty years. Unfortunately, these traditional engines use keyword-based approaches to solve the search problem, but these approaches are prone to ambiguity and synonymy. On the other hand, bibliographic search techniques based only on the citation information are not prone to these problems since they do not consider textual similarity. For many particular research areas and topics, the amount of knowledge to humankind is immense, and obtaining the desired information is as hard as looking for a needle in a haystack. Furthermore, sometimes, what we are looking for is a set of documents where each one is different than the others, but at the same time, as a whole we want them to cover all the important parts of the literature relevant to our search. This paper targets the problem of result diversification in citation-based bibliographic search. It surveys a set of techniques which aim to find a set of papers with satisfactory quality and diversity. We enhance these algorithms with a direction-awareness functionality to allow the users to reach either old, well-cited, well-known research papers or recent, less-known ones. We also propose a set of novel techniques for a better diversification of the results. All the techniques considered are compared by performing a rigorous experimentation. The results show that some of the proposed techniques are very successful in practice while performing a search in a bibliographic database.","Küçüktunç, Onur;Saule, Erik;Kaya, Kamer;Çatalyürek, Ümit V.",ArXiv e-prints,509ac2f300;X00aec6d50;X0a067c4aa;X0e325a5e4;X0e5c02f87;X13fd931ff;X25738593d;X2d0454223;X2d7d9d257;X30945bfc3;X32cfc5db3;X358a0f27a;X36c4a4922;X38a848d43;X39aeb101d;X48213288a;X65fef8241;X8468b0ff2;X8aeadcbd9;X8c6c502f6;X9cd27b529;Xa33e8819d;Xa6ef77dfc;Xb1d4ae118;Xb434989a9;Xce5e92e49;Xd92b00d23;Xdad6086b8;Xe3a4748d2;Xf2422c8d3;Xfd6d017b4,31,Diversifying Citation Recommendations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5809,2012

797,"Background: Citation analysis has become an important tool for research performance assessment in the medical sciences. However, different areas of medical research may have considerably different citation practices, even within the same medical field. Because of this, it is unclear to what extent citation-based bibliometric indicators allow for valid comparisons between research units active in different areas of medical research. Methodology: A visualization methodology is introduced that reveals differences in citation practices between medical research areas. The methodology extracts terms from the titles and abstracts of a large collection of publications and uses these terms to visualize the structure of a medical field and to indicate how research areas within this field differ from each other in their average citation impact. Results: Visualizations are provided for 32 medical fields, defined based on journal subject categories in the Web of Science database. The analysis focuses on three fields. In each of these fields, there turn out to be large differences in citation practices between research areas. Low-impact research areas tend to focus on clinical intervention research, while high-impact research areas are often more oriented on basic and diagnostic research. Conclusions: Popular bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index and the impact factor, do not correct for differences in citation practices between medical fields. These indicators therefore cannot be used to make accurate between-field comparisons. More sophisticated bibliometric indicators do correct for field differences but still fail to take into account within-field heterogeneity in citation practices. As a consequence, the citation impact of clinical intervention research may be substantially underestimated in comparison with basic and diagnostic research.","van Eck, Nees Jan;Waltman, Ludo;van Raan, Anthony F.

798,"A desirable goal of scientific management is to introduce, if it exists, a simple and reliable way to measure the scientific excellence of publicly-funded research institutions and universities to serve as a basis for their ranking and financing. While citation-based indicators and metrics are easily accessible, they are far from being universally accepted as way to automate or inform evaluation processes or to replace evaluations based on peer review. Here we consider absolute measurements of research excellence at an amalgamated, institutional level and specific measures of research excellence as performance per head. Using biology research institutions in the UK as a test case, we examine the correlations between peer-review-based and citation-based measures of research excellence on these two scales. We find that citation-based indicators are very highly correlated with peer-evaluated measures of group strength but are poorly correlated with group quality. Thus, and almost paradoxically, our analysis indicates that citation counts could possibly form a basis for deciding on how to fund research institutions but they should not be used as a basis for ranking them in terms of quality.","Mryglod, O.;Kenna, R.;Holovatch, Yu.;Berche, B.",ArXiv e-prints,X0716f2c8f;X0d74db05f;X162289e0e;X2479f89d2;X393d5395d;X44b004c6e;X4ff4aa954;X5a04023e5;X6c74a1aa2;X79723ef24;X8670e1498;X92fba0127;X978142a9b;X9b5425294;Xa1b994b71;Xa53ea4545;Xb3911572c;Xb41475c95;Xbf6486c2b;Xc256dc31b;Xdad6086b8;Xe57f6296a;Xf9669f57f;Xfe1dbc03b,24,Absolute and specific measures of research group excellence,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0732,2012
799,"I will propose a new way of advancing white dwarf research. Open science is a method of doing research that lets everyone who has something to say about the subject take partin the problem solving process.  Already now, the amount of information we gather from observations, theory and modeling is too vast for any one individual to comprehend and turn into knowledge. And the amount ofinformation just keeps growing in the future. A platform that promotes sharing of thoughts and ideas allows us to pool our collective knowledge of white dwarfs and get a clearpicture of our research field. It will also make it possible for researchers in fields closely related to ours (AGB stars, planetary nebulae etc.) to join the scientific discourse.   In the first stage this project would allow us to summarize what we know and what we don't, and what we should search for next. Later, it could grow into a large collaboration thatwould have the impact to, for example, suggest instrument requirements for future telescopes to satisfy the needs of the white dwarf community, or propose large surveys.   A simple implementation would be a wiki page for collecting knowledge combined with a forum for more extensive discussions. These would be simple and cheap to maintain. A largecommunity effort on the whole would be needed for the project to succeed, but individual workload should stay at a low level.","Vornanen, T.",18th European White Dwarf Workshop.,X178dd6f76;X1b174fff3;X22096a56a;X267288b22;X3df444a47;X48165aa43;X509ecb0b5;X5d2fc8824;X6f76727f5;X710a48d75;X750661f39;X8286959f5;X83f8602a3;Xa71117dab;Xbcb58a407;Xc9f9f5d7d;Xda3a2b6ba;Xf33e27e7d,18,Open Science Project in White Dwarf Research,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0713,2013
800,"We put under experimental scrutiny the preferential attachment model that is commonly accepted as a generating mechanism of the scale-free complex networks. To this end we chose a citation network of physics papers and traced the citation history of 40 195 papers published in one year. Contrary to common belief, we find that the citation dynamics of the individual papers follows the superlinear preferential attachment, with the exponent α=1.25-1.3. Moreover, we show that the citation process cannot be described as a memoryless Markov chain since there is a substantial correlation between the present and recent citation rates of a paper. Based on our findings we construct a stochastic growth model of the citation network, perform numerical simulations based on this model and achieve an excellent agreement with the measured citation distributions.","Golosovsky, Michael;Solomon, Sorin",Physical Review Letters,X549477331;X65db559ff;X6d1be79d0;X6e29272b8;X70c2babfc;Xc76d0928b;Xc8f0662a1;Xce93e3fe1;Xd3a4c62ab;Xdec7c7873,10,Stochastic Dynamical Model of a Growing Citation Network Based on a Self-Exciting Point Process,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0756,2012
801,"Although user access patterns on the live web are well-understood, there has been no corresponding study of how users, both humans and robots, access web archives. Based on samples from the Internet Archive's public Wayback Machine, we propose a set of basic usage patterns: Dip (a single access), Slide (the same page at different archive times), Dive (different pages at approximately the same archive time), and Skim (lists of what pages are archived, i.e., TimeMaps). Robots are limited almost exclusively to Dips and Skims, but human accesses are more varied between all four types. Robots outnumber humans 10:1 in terms of sessions, 5:4 in terms of raw HTTP accesses, and 4:1 in terms of megabytes transferred. Robots almost always access TimeMaps (95% of accesses), but humans predominately access the archived web pages themselves (82% of accesses). In terms of unique archived web pages, there is no overall preference for a particular time, but the recent past (within the last year) shows significant repeat accesses.","AlNoamany, Yasmin;Weigle, Michele C.;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X0a86127d0;X0a9b62ecc;X333c897e2;X5535fa7d6;X5e3dd2a28;X61d4a7fc4;X770e5ded7;X7c2728dd0;X9868f667f;X9d0c16700;Xad63ebb71;Xb60b8ceb4;Xbcc5ad134;Xc1b45f555;Xd2bfdad3a;Xdb105c239;Xe44bfe222;Xecc1989a1;Xf03fbbf0e;Xfa71a0ad7;Xfceb5bde6,21,Access Patterns for Robots and Humans in Web Archives,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4009,2013
802,"Are editorial decisions biased? A recent discussion in Learned Publishing has focused on one aspect of potential bias in editorial decisions, namely seasonal (e.g., monthly) variations in acceptance rates of research journals. In this letter, we contribute to the discussion by analyzing data from Physical Review Letters (PRL), a journal published by the American Physical Society. We studied the 190,106 papers submitted to PRL from January 1990 until September 2012. No statistically significant variations were found in the monthly acceptance rates. We conclude that the time of year that the authors of a paper submit their work to PRL has no effect on the fate of the paper through the review process.","Antonoyiannakis, Manolis",ArXiv e-prints,550f66ec6c;X0306bd660;X03a9c40a1;X03bd168f1;X044b17010;X04d5041e9;X055f954ff;X060bf9f94;X060ee5ff4;X0620cab54;X06414dc59;X094f1a76c;X0972feeca;X0b3aec6bb;X0b80a88ec;X0bf5b063b;X0c8593903;X0d5dd3425;X0d82dafdd;X0e746043b;X117b4c832;X11af3ced6;X11dd64f28;X1227ea209;X12db0539b;X132d9380c;X139792942;X14983bdd4;X153d3584f;X1625d6a00;X16409d716;X172c91749;X19f802fe1;X19f81ca05;X19f9f1618;X1a548c17e;X1b2a0e3d4;X1b948abe8;X1ba1775b4;X1bd2e7d54;X1f3b9c846;X21d6064a1;X21f02154c;X22429f77b;X22efd8cbf;X2315846ba;X2373d498d;X247d70306;X24984b812;X264308584;X2748303e2;X2a05325a9;X2acd8c062;X2c5e186b7;X2c718ad93;X2d99e0cff;X2f462f42c;X30456dd72;X30a6653be;X32ae867fc;X33cf0404b;X33ef97c81;X3530dc2a0;X35736b024;X38575e34c;X386352f0f;X3aafd2cd9;X3afc77138;X3b3d80ed3;X3b5b747d1;X3b5c5875e;X3bee459ae;X3c4d9a759;X3d7574feb;X3db3c560f;X3de04e46b;X3e3baf894;X3e9f1436f;X3f4474ea4;X4039d5986;X43ba45dbf;X44f9768cf;X4503d6e83;X4587abe2b;X4689b415f;X46b2e4910;X475a8ef18;X47911eaf1;X484249038;X48f9c6a35;X49f33294b;X4a92765e6;X4ad3e3e93;X4cbe51394;X4da764d83;X4f1e5fd91;X4ff59dac5;X50f983cf3;X5111d1d2f;X5158c0681;X53bbe64f2;X545334e7f;X54a91c3a0;X55e3aa359;X568bf4164;X56c19885e;X57cfc400e;X5a1b3b6e6;X5ad21d756;X5af19ce49;X5b5eff6c1;X5b8f206a9;X5ba6ebd76;X5c2e20c76;X5c7dd7e9f;X5d31a968e;X6060d1865;X606e69242;X6071a783b;X6207fa7e6;X6345c7f2f;X63aea976f;X64609428c;X6493ce3cb;X655d4980d;X65994dcca;X662033f22;X682f9ad60;X695121270;X69dd8ef31;X6a7cc5f12;X6f048906c;X703874efe;X703e3db9b;X70989da6e;X70be2c71f;X717f9d604;X71d89e4ad;X72570b7ea;X732379607;X737ddb4a0;X73b475644;X744f6e920;X74c1e3117;X75a6b8dd7;X75ea0dbff;X7655b7945;X76f6c7754;X7972a8aa2;X7a2782ab9;X7a5ec8ed9;X7b68d456f;X7bc99a29f;X7ca9bbac5;X7d208ce22;X7e37d464c;X7f7f43e59;X7f94e378d;X80b061437;X810d39cb3;X8196c8303;X81f8e457d;X8356da11f;X838c64150;X83d807fc7;X844fad759;X84e4d762a;X85abc8110;X8635832fe;X8676d6e6d;X871c6678f;X87d4136c0;X882d25e37;X888f6fbdd;X88b953892;X88fe2ef57;X8a1b1fb8f;X8a74382c3;X8af263452;X8e30360b5;X8e63bf593;X8ff720d9d;X903967f76;X9051e0730;X90a5ca683;X91ba6d8af;X91e30af27;X923e7f8ea;X9423313e9;X94a501a4b;X9551f8121;X95b13005f;X9703b3c14;X97980b3d8;X9886c4d2f;X996d6d505;X99a3fd186;X99b75db5f;X99e528d29;X9b38e35ae;X9bc15baf1;X9c16effee;X9d16b459c;X9d8288891;X9e5d97a58;X9f4dfdead;X9f84469a8;Xa034e828b;Xa088cc370;Xa184ec962;Xa2145781d;Xa525d9dd5;Xa559b02af;Xa59526fde;Xa5a562b47;Xa6b0bdb51;Xa7693ab89;Xa7f5ff8b8;Xa89bc78d4;Xa8f0631e0;Xa9b7c866c;Xa9fc206a6;Xaa86a983e;Xaa8be8d67;Xabc3b20cb;Xabffe8160;Xac0c27afc;Xac7bf2369;Xad00419c5;Xae4aaedf0;Xaf535e50d;Xb03072843;Xb2d3295d2;Xb3083d556;Xb33033d01;Xb41b00495;Xb494f20a7;Xb73a0325f;Xb7ac6e472;Xb89c928c9;Xb8eac228a;Xba5e2b840;Xbbc4303f1;Xbbeee5f38;Xbcf26fc75;Xbd90b9fda;Xbe0839881;Xbeb9401ea;Xbf17cd3c6;Xbf44a4a7d;Xbf990e689;Xc01375a25;Xc0ceadece;Xc13527386;Xc31eacafb;Xc3362fa59;Xc37f6cfb8;Xc41c79f26;Xc4f69a2fb;Xc52a39115;Xc7de57a3d;Xc89e8c9ba;Xc8df74ded;Xc8f628580;Xca73f0e55;Xca7858d9e;Xcafa7a534;Xcc3842ec5;Xccf5a9379;Xcd7228171;Xcd8c72ec1;Xcdb51d5b0;Xce2e2c652;Xcead543d9;Xcefca4d1a;Xcf20d6ec6;Xcfb9f28ab;Xd033a9c17;Xd1e9d13b1;Xd24740371;Xd247a0029;Xd439113a6;Xd4e2ab11c;Xd52bec62f;Xd64ba6919;Xd6560448e;Xd6b76f166;Xd7ed5c213;Xd85656f33;Xd92dd709e;Xd946396e6;Xdc3e655a9;Xdc505ef6c;Xdca407a49;Xde0872ca3;Xde166fb83;Xde8e34664;Xdfe318e8b;Xe01f84745;Xe04d25006;Xe1b21aa4b;Xe48b5c1dc;Xe50399168;Xe60fb5ce6;Xe76ef98fe;Xe780d78ec;Xe808b3aad;Xe82dc19aa;Xe888b10cc;Xe9212cce4;Xe93f54cd9;Xea38677fd;Xebdce064f;Xec4d9e188;Xec7bb353a;Xec863f682;Xeca082d8c;Xed3a8ac3e;Xeea6429e0;Xeeb63b9f0;Xeeca2fe86;Xef37c8dc5;Xef4ad6951;Xef5cecb2a;Xefb99a26c;Xf0ee97000;Xf1ca20ce8;Xf22f9a7fa;Xf33cf3f16;Xf39a6db0b;Xf780a3da4;Xf89f960b7;Xf8c3d696e;Xfa0e9efce;Xfa3b1192f;Xfdf512e2f;Xfe1ff2fb8;Xfeb952832,338,Acceptance Rates in Physical Review Letters: No Seasonal Bias,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1552,2013
803,"The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is an open access digital library portal for researchers in astronomy and physics, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) under a NASA grant, successfully serving the professional science community for two decades. Currently there are about 55,000 frequent users (100+ queries per year), and up to 10 million infrequent users per year. Access by the general public now accounts for about half of all ADS use, demonstrating the vast reach of the content in our databases. The visibility and use of content in the ADS can be measured by the fact that there are over 17,000 links from Wikipedia pages to ADS content, a figure comparable to the number of links that Wikipedia has to OCLC's WorldCat catalog. The ADS, through its holdings and innovative techniques available in ADS Labs, offers an environment for information discovery that is unlike any other service currently available to the astrophysics community. Literature discovery and review are important components of science education, aiding the process of preparing for a class, project, or presentation. The ADS has been recognized as a rich source of information for the science education community in astronomy, thanks to its collaborations within the astronomy community, publishers and projects like ComPADRE. One element that makes the ADS uniquely relevant for the science education community is the availability of powerful tools to explore aspects of the astronomy literature as well as the relationship between topics, people, observations and scientific papers. The other element is the extensive repository of scanned literature, a significant fraction of which consists of historical literature.","Henneken, E.

804,"Newspapers are documents made of news item and informative articles. They are not meant to be red iteratively: the reader can pick his items in any order he fancies. Ignoring this structural property, most digitized newspaper archives only offer access by issue or at best by page to their content. We have built a digitization workflow that automatically extracts newspaper articles from images, which allows indexing and retrieval of information at the article level. Our back-end system extracts the logical structure of the page to produce the informative units: the articles. Each image is labelled at the pixel level, through a machine learning based method, then the page logical structure is constructed up from there by the detection of structuring entities such as horizontal and vertical separators, titles and text lines. This logical structure is stored in a METS wrapper associated to the ALTO file produced by the system including the OCRed text. Our front-end system provides a web high definition visualisation of images, textual indexing and retrieval facilities, searching and reading at the article level. Articles transcriptions can be collaboratively corrected, which as a consequence allows for better indexing. We are currently testing our system on the archives of the Journal de Rouen, one of France eldest local newspaper. These 250 years of publication amount to 300 000 pages of very variable image quality and layout complexity.

805,"Modern science is a main driver of technological innovation. The efficiency of the scientific system is of key importance to ensure the competitiveness of a nation or region. However, the scientific system that we use today was devised centuries ago and is inadequate for our current ICT-based society: the peer review system encourages conservatism, journal publications are monolithic and slow, data is often not available to other scientists, and the independent validation of results is limited. The resulting scientific process is hence slow and sloppy. Building on the Innovation Accelerator paper by Helbing and Balietti [1], this paper takes the initial global vision and reviews the theoretical and technological building blocks that can be used for implementing an innovation (in first place: science) accelerator platform driven by re-imagining the science system. The envisioned platform would rest on four pillars: (i) Redesign the incentive scheme to reduce behavior such as conservatism, herding and hyping; (ii) Advance scientific publications by breaking up the monolithic paper unit and introducing other building blocks such as data, tools, experiment workflows, resources; (iii) Use machine readable semantics for publications, debate structures, provenance etc. in order to include the computer as a partner in the scientific process, and (iv) Build an online platform for collaboration, including a network of trust and reputation among the different types of stakeholders in the scientific system: scientists, educators, funding agencies, policy makers, students and industrial innovators among others. Any such improvements to the scientific system must support the entire scientific process (unlike current tools that chop up the scientific process into disconnected pieces), must facilitate and encourage collaboration and interdisciplinarity (again unlike current tools), must facilitate the inclusion of intelligent computing in the scientific process, must facilitate not only the core scientific process, but also accommodate other stakeholders such science policy makers, industrial innovators, and the general public. We first describe the current state of the scientific system together with up to a dozen new key initiatives, including an analysis of the role of science as an innovation accelerator. Our brief survey will show that there exist many separate ideas and concepts and diverse stand-alone demonstrator systems for different components of the ecosystem with many parts are still unexplored, and overall integration lacking. By analyzing a matrix of stakeholders vs. functionalities, we identify the required innovations. We (non-exhaustively) discuss a few of them: Publications that are meaningful to machines, innovative reviewing processes, data publication, workflow archiving and reuse, alternative impact metrics, tools for the detection of trends, community formation and emergence, as well as modular publications, citation objects and debate graphs. To summarize, the core idea behind the Innovation Accelerator is to develop new incentive models, rules, and interaction mechanisms to stimulate true innovation, revolutionizing the way in which we create knowledge and disseminate information.","van Harmelen, F.;Kampis, G.;Börner, K.;van den Besselaar, P.;Schultes, E.;Goble, C.;Groth, P.;Mons, B.;Anderson, S.;Decker, S.;Hayes, C.;Buecheler, T.;Helbing, D.",European Physical Journal Special Topics,X01fa47ba5;X10726dddd;X17b052198;X3ee41c49b;X4a637dbae;X525266222;X552afbfae;X568c72e60;X5aef82973;X61eaf27f5;X6538ecced;X7ed78c93a;X8057490eb;X80db8546b;X8f9485ae3;X97ec26e6f;X9f11f9080;Xac7d78017;Xae11164ec;Xcf8fbd0c6;Xe6e16274b;Xeedffcd94,22,Theoretical and technological building blocks for an innovation accelerator,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1480,2012
806,"Is software obsolescence a significant risk? To explore this issue, we analysed a corpus of over 2.5 billion resources corresponding to the UK Web domain, as crawled between 1996 and 2010. Using the DROID and Apache Tika identification tools, we examined each resource and captured the results as extended MIME types, embedding version, software and hardware identifiers alongside the format information. The combined results form a detailed temporal format profile of the corpus, which we have made available as open data. We present the results of our initial analysis of this dataset. We look at image, HTML and PDF resources in some detail, showing how the usage of different formats, versions and software implementations has changed over time. Furthermore, we show that software obsolescence is rare on the web and uncover evidence indicating that network effects act to stabilise formats against obsolescence.","Jackson, Andrew N.",ArXiv e-prints,54f8bc8d87;X05df8797c;X0b9b663f5;X115d8f554;X14430fd3c;X14a9e5ac5;X1ac60ddf3;X1b8309d99;X1f1b6800c;X24f9ed3e0;X36bd20a2e;X3c0c3d37d;X3f77abd6c;X59a7e32f2;X5a72e6a96;X6275854b6;X63e7a359e;X65bd09864;X66735eea7;X6683680dc;X6d7d5cb61;X6f31d3d48;X74708af87;X8420aeb35;X8580d5eaa;X8994d8a9f;X8cecb3bf8;X921ae3168;X9c8e43f43;X9d6dc6a23;Xa0d73a1ec;Xa24ea98ac;Xadb2ce1d6;Xb2d0066dc;Xb3cfe05e1;Xc13363b72;Xc8e728305;Xceb661763;Xd162aea3e;Xdd740391e;Xe161457a9;Xe3b9b3ef9,42,Formats over Time: Exploring UK Web History,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1714,2012

808,"References are an essential component of research articles and therefore of scientific communication. In this study we investigate referencing (citing) behavior in five diverse fields (astronomy, mathematics, robotics, ecology and economics) based on 213,756 core journal articles. At the macro level we find: (a) a steady increase in the number of references per article over the period studied (50 years), which in some fields is due to a higher rate of usage, while in others reflects longer articles and (b) an increase in all fields in the fraction of older, foundational references since the 1980s, with no obvious change in citing patterns associated with the introduction of the Internet. At the meso level we explore current (2006-2010) referencing behavior of different categories of authors (21,562 total) within each field, based on their academic age, productivity and collaborative practices. Contrary to some previous findings and expectations we find that senior researchers use references at the same rate as their junior colleagues, with similar rates of re-citation (use of same references in multiple papers). High Modified Price Index (MPI, which measures the speed of the research front more accurately than the traditional Price Index) of senior authors indicates that their research has the similar cutting-edge aspect as that of their younger colleagues. In all fields both the productive researchers and especially those who collaborate more use a significantly lower fraction of foundational references and have much higher MPI and lower re-citation rates, i.e., they are the ones pushing the research front regardless of researcher age. This paper introduces improved bibliometric methods to measure the speed of the research front, disambiguate lead authors in co-authored papers and decouple measures of productivity and collaboration.","Milojević, Staša",PLoS ONE,X01add5125;X112f39c4d;X114c73560;X12fb13aa7;X16d7ea532;X3134932c9;X32d41d9d2;X3d654a5ed;X3ea0e6cba;X3f5898d72;X3f85b0388;X40fd8e59c;X4157e801c;X4f7e327b0;X51103e090;X6816ac152;X6f73e9099;X72ede7437;X826c70ab2;Xa11ba5ae3;Xa1b994b71;Xa2ab14915;Xa6cb5d1b4;Xab72bf994;Xac7d17919;Xb903f0e80;Xba6b39ce3;Xbc9da54f1;Xbea40387e;Xc88e830c4;Xd22bb8342;Xdc7b77586;Xdfaaf9831;Xe8ed76778;Xf5a44f9af;Xfa1748b57;Xff3bdb73f,37,"How Are Academic Age, Productivity and Collaboration Related to Citing Behavior of Researchers?",http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3727,2012
809,"The proliferation of the Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) has resulted in the creation of a large number of service providers, all harvesting from either data providers or aggregators. If data were available regarding the similarity of metadata records, service providers could track redundant records across harvests from multiple sources as well as provide additional end-user services. Due to the large number of metadata formats and the diverse mapping strategies employed by data providers, similarity calculation requirements necessitate the use of information retrieval strategies. We describe an OAI-PMH aggregator implementation that uses the optional ``〈about〉'' container to re-export the results of similarity calculations. Metadata records (3751) were harvested from a NASA data provider and similarities for the records were computed. The results were useful for detecting duplicates, similarities and metadata errors.","Harrison, Terry L.;Elango, Aravind;Bollen, Johan;Nelson, Michael",ArXiv e-prints,X5daa3e99a;X92c8b8366;Xcd3a3136c;Xd48dfe068,4,Initial Experiences Re-Exporting Duplicate and Similarity Computation with an OAI-PMH aggregator,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0401001,2004

Based on web access logs, we analyze what users are looking for, why they come to IA, where they come from, and how pages link to IA. We find that users request English pages the most, followed by the European languages. Most human users come to web archives because they do not find the requested pages on the live web. About 65% of the requested archived pages no longer exist on the live web. We find that more than 82% of human sessions connect to the Wayback Machine via referrals from other web sites, while only 15% of robots have referrers.

818,"We have now tested the Finch Committee's Hypothesis that Green Open Access Mandates are ineffective in generating deposits in institutional repositories. With data from ROARMAP on institutional Green OA mandates and data from ROAR on institutional repositories, we show that deposit number and rate is significantly correlated with mandate strength (classified as 1-12): The stronger the mandate, the more the deposits. The strongest mandates generate deposit rates of 70%+ within 2 years of adoption, compared to the un-mandated deposit rate of 20%. The effect is already detectable at the national level, where the UK, which has the largest proportion of Green OA mandates, has a national OA rate of 35%, compared to the global baseline of 25%. The conclusion is that, contrary to the Finch Hypothesis, Green Open Access Mandates do have a major effect, and the stronger the mandate, the stronger the effect (the Liege ID/OA mandate, linked to research performance evaluation, being the strongest mandate model). RCUK (as well as all universities, research institutions and research funders worldwide) would be well advised to adopt the strongest Green OA mandates and to integrate institutional and funder mandates.","Gargouri, Yassine;Lariviere, Vincent;Gingras, Yves;Brody, Tim;Carr, Les;Harnad, Stevan",ArXiv e-prints,X00aec6d50;X05420c43f;X1a3eea16b;X1e79150a2;X2e180d82c;X3db5ff619;X55e3aa359;X573bdceef;X5928625db;X5d5511297;X62907ea68;X6ba3c6ebb;X74c1e3117;X74d880b51;X9cb01d7b9;X9ed2cef66;Xb267e1b00;Xc063a16d2;Xd247a0029;Xd280b556c;Xd539f57bd;Xfa36a82ac,22,Testing the Finch Hypothesis on Green OA Mandate Ineffectiveness,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8174,2012
819,"The pervasive use of information and communication technology (ICT) in modern societies enables countless opportunities for individuals, institutions, businesses and scientists, but also raises difficult ethical and social problems. In particular, ICT helped to make societies more complex and thus harder to understand, which impedes social and political interventions to avoid harm and to increase the common good. To overcome this obstacle, the large-scale EU flagship proposal FuturICT intends to create a platform for accessing global human knowledge as a public good and instruments to increase our understanding of the information society by making use of ICT-based research. In this contribution, we outline the ethical justification for such an endeavor. We argue that the ethical issues raised by FuturICT research projects overlap substantially with many of the known ethical problems emerging from ICT use in general. By referring to the notion of Value Sensitive Design, we show for the example of privacy how this core value of responsible ICT can be protected in pursuing research in the framework of FuturICT.

820,"Percentiles have been established in bibliometrics as an important alternative to mean-based indicators for obtaining a normalized citation impact of publications. Percentiles have a number of advantages over standard bibliometric indicators used frequently: for example, their calculation is not based on the arithmetic mean which should not be used for skewed bibliometric data. This study describes the opportunities and limits and the advantages and disadvantages of using percentiles in bibliometrics. We also address problems in the calculation of percentiles and percentile rank classes for which there is not (yet) a satisfactory solution. It will be hard to compare the results of different percentile-based studies with each other unless it is clear that the studies were done with the same choices for percentile calculation and rank assignment.","Bornmann, Lutz;Leydesdorff, Loet;Mutz, Ruediger",ArXiv e-prints,X00eed5396;X0128f100f;X03414b8d1;X037fb65a5;X06353f90a;X06bd188dd;X06df488ab;X0736307bc;X07d31e3f2;X088448d43;X08e41c06f;X09f12661b;X0b511c69b;X0d0efe05a;X0e10345df;X0e20be7a2;X0ed668c88;X1082c927d;X10998af37;X10f6dc261;X11037c71f;X115647b69;X1201f5345;X121a9c216;X12c4877da;X13bb82248;X13ef366c8;X149dca121;X14bc993d7;X14ced7f8c;X155967f10;X156c5beab;X164da8c0e;X1708e4161;X173117070;X17d7367a5;X1873695b7;X1882ec132;X188514383;X192931e25;X1a161c833;X1a79563e9;X1a86f4473;X1c461a64c;X1c57600cf;X1d19e6063;X1d243aa68;X1d906fb44;X1e0c4c541;X1e4ec237d;X1ea6e0659;X1ed907ffd;X1fb1c12e8;X2101b6707;X21afac525;X2255e0453;X235968e78;X24391b3e9;X24c41dbb6;X257031ce7;X25f6b477b;X2647b91c8;X28723591a;X28dacc153;X2a048f110;X2a8ed8872;X2a9f0f0cf;X2a9f1f740;X2b73afe82;X2ba61f300;X2c0ef526c;X2d2b08f8f;X2ec5bc59b;X2ef8a4546;X2f6ff9089;X2ffdaa19f;X30474b390;X3136b762b;X318ead84a;X31fbf1e99;X32664eb28;X32deca385;X356c67b39;X3642fb27c;X365e7534c;X3795999d4;X3861dccb4;X386b500b3;X38b46e281;X39bb67679;X39c476578;X3a58df7ab;X3aac4b2e6;X3cfd96c49;X3d0d3ac2d;X3d9898391;X3e0bca827;X3e12d7960;X3e8601395;X3f89b3d88;X3ff1f6580;X41585935a;X4175a5dad;X432c542fa;X46308e9df;X463355d35;X47956364b;X4b3356601;X4b779acd9;X4c2490783;X4d2d5e03e;X4f2e665f4;X4fa983b20;X517f5c497;X5200bbf4d;X52ef74d56;X530cc234f;X540a618a7;X571ded4a8;X57d2a59ed;X582d87a13;X585fae680;X5886cd6fa;X59ac47c88;X59b88467a;X59f424796;X5ad4813d7;X5c926595c;X5d8d9b927;X5e67a2cb1;X5eac806aa;X5ec26c828;X61af479e3;X628f9541a;X637adc202;X641337b0f;X64a87d440;X64bed2c54;X64c2af929;X64da73e4e;X65b13ee8e;X65dd118c2;X665e24540;X67a5a10b9;X67e8f4adb;X68354938a;X685c0c513;X685d71fe9;X68a5c01e7;X6a5eea318;X6b47b92c5;X6bede4d74;X6c1c25560;X6c7f58756;X6cf80c48d;X6d5cf759f;X6e5dbfe51;X6f07e889f;X6f27c4d67;X6f5a84ceb;X706e59cd7;X7172b892f;X71c4c2cb3;X71e943583;X721e97fbb;X72788f107;X73090f997;X734a1cdaa;X73b54a1e0;X73b633fb8;X73c49f09a;X74e31ac5e;X74f1a43c4;X75ac8b0c0;X761c4b6ab;X770f52617;X7768424b6;X791568d25;X79b4e2794;X7b0b8f636;X7b5cdcb41;X7bda82c30;X7c86b2477;X7ca529a4b;X7d163150b;X7d29baa5f;X7f7697dcf;X7fc39b74f;X7fdfbf9e0;X808173f21;X80a83d607;X81bb430a1;X823ef5b38;X825bf1fef;X85b425dc1;X8602b5331;X86c3126b0;X87c6d0bae;X89680fc78;X8997c9d6e;X8acaecd5d;X8b1ae0f64;X8b46494cc;X8d394c785;X8d40f45e3;X8d68daf96;X8e2d36909;X8ed048db9;X907b4f860;X90cc3484d;X92bc679d4;X932951982;X93e88b0cf;X95bc9b3a8;X965df635c;X96aacea47;X97c63cb73;X984264063;X98c664691;X99a04745b;X99ccdff2e;X9a2620dd6;X9a3045911;X9a82d95a0;X9c0baf391;X9cda01296;X9d05cfc6d;X9dae0d383;X9ed1edbc3;Xa0a453e62;Xa1aea7927;Xa1b994b71;Xa4a288142;Xa592d9f36;Xa5e755511;Xa5fce5a2b;Xa65f8f68d;Xa69bacedc;Xa750e2bfe;Xa7756dd42;Xa79ece2d5;Xa7cd9dbd3;Xa9d99f154;Xa9fc5e9f1;Xaa54190e0;Xac2b18038;Xac847c7d9;Xad100054b;Xad2f23dc4;Xafb5a6ab6;Xb031622ad;Xb0e9cbacd;Xb110d848f;Xb158565b4;Xb198fa13a;Xb29537ec2;Xb2a9f5529;Xb2fae47fa;Xb31407350;Xb34570094;Xb464d6a63;Xb4c658af3;Xb50e05f0b;Xb5fb79bab;Xb6a06d625;Xb813b4e74;Xb8db92021;Xba2e8a546;Xbbd933b53;Xbbe25de31;Xbc05dedba;Xbccab90b1;Xbd1a8adf1;Xbd9a4f279;Xbdc063766;Xbee371879;Xbf44bc0a3;Xbf4cf59fa;Xc06401ba8;Xc08a0069a;Xc09b2deee;Xc16cf73d1;Xc17823bbc;Xc1c16a7a9;Xc3e6f9d2d;Xc4936ae7e;Xc7b171aed;Xc80d6058f;Xc80e08158;Xc874d4430;Xc94ca59e9;Xca391df6d;Xca8038752;Xcb43bf4d2;Xcb9ae327d;Xcc158edcf;Xcc5620271;Xcc6ac3623;Xcc9dd593a;Xcd495c9e7;Xcd7ed9259;Xcfa2deea8;Xd1287555e;Xd3aae216d;Xd546b7e21;Xd5b153f77;Xd6222df2f;Xd692585f4;Xd89aad089;Xd9cac14be;Xda45862b8;Xdac96e3c8;Xdb384694f;Xdb6db4ba1;Xdbdf47cbd;Xdc4072c2e;Xdc4bd0fbd;Xdc7ef63bb;Xdccb98e2f;Xdcf615e47;Xdd934e629;Xddd3f0129;Xdecbc604b;Xdee32e596;Xdf54123a1;Xdf65a9c83;Xdf8f3164d;Xdfba8bf81;Xe1acffd48;Xe39afca06;Xe4c7cbf5a;Xe5d995f1a;Xe6e51fb36;Xe96948132;Xea659d0ee;Xea728c50f;Xebe5282e1;Xec0e55081;Xec5c53726;Xef58a649c;Xef6d0e4b2;Xf0ad5bd07;Xf1a8d33a7;Xf32e3a0f6;Xf4a52b4de;Xf4d53ede6;Xf74fcf631;Xf83cc08c8;Xf88ee8a76;Xf8b55fa75;Xf8f6dcf6f;Xf92097f6c;Xf9385efc0;Xfa4597747;Xfa82730a3;Xfc0890ecb;Xfc80bd5d9;Xfd7a8e4a8;Xfd9159c24;Xfd95a9761;Xfe772bc9e;Xfe9c92844;Xfef47238f;Xff638d951;Xff7e10aeb;Xff833bb4c;Xffd6b7ec6,367,The use of percentiles and percentile rank classes in the analysis of bibliometric data: Opportunities and limits,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0381,2012

In order to improve its information retrieval and word similarity ranking capabilities, the goal of this thesis is to enhance Invenio by bridging it with modern external information retrieval systems. In the first part a comparison of various information retrieval systems such as Solr and Xapian is made. In the second part a system-independent bridge for word similarity ranking is designed and implemented. Subsequently, Solr and Xapian are integrated in Invenio via adapters to the bridge. In the third part scalability tests are performed.

Our approach focuses on the positions of journals in the multidimensional space spanned by the aggregated journal-journal citations.

826,"Many memory institutions hold large collections of hand-held media, which can comprise hundreds of terabytes of data spread over many thousands of data-carriers. Many of these carriers are at risk of significant physical degradation over time, depending on their composition. Unfortunately, handling them manually is enormously time consuming and so a full and frequent evaluation of their condition is extremely expensive. It is, therefore, important to develop scalable processes for stabilizing them onto backed-up online storage where they can be subject to highquality digital preservation management. This goes hand in hand with the need to establish efficient, standardized ways of recording metadata and to deal with defective data-carriers. This paper discusses processing approaches, workflows, technical set-up, software solutions and touches on staffing needs for the stabilization process. We have experimented with different disk copying robots, defined our metadata, and addressed storage issues to scale stabilization to the vast quantities of digital objects on hand-held data-carriers that need to be preserved. Working closely with the content curators, we have been able to build a robust data migration workflow and have stabilized over 16 terabytes of data in a scalable and economical manner.","Dappert, Angela;Jackson, Andrew N.;Kimura, Akiko",ArXiv e-prints,X18432c7f1;X1d71eb338;X33dc7bfe9;X3c9a989d1;X42a6d550e;X446ef7a89;X53298d1bb;X5b0876d2f;X7188a8017;X7793f5670;X8b926d5a4;X8eb4aea57;X99d1cea72;X9c0180e14;X9f030c9b6;Xa27655af1;Xaa54df3fe;Xacac3135e;Xb45caad8b;Xdf330bd40;Xe7494b36c;Xf2ae37ad0,22,Developing a Robust Migration Workflow for Preserving and Curating Hand-held Media,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4932,2013
827,"The data of F1000 provide us with the unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between peers' ratings and bibliometric metrics on a broad and comprehensive data set with high-quality ratings. F1000 is a post-publication peer review system of the biomedical literature. The comparison of metrics with peer evaluation has been widely acknowledged as a way of validating metrics. Based on the seven indicators offered by InCites, we analyzed the validity of raw citation counts (Times Cited, 2nd Generation Citations, and 2nd Generation Citations per Citing Document), normalized indicators (Journal Actual/Expected Citations, Category Actual/Expected Citations, and Percentile in Subject Area), and a journal based indicator (Journal Impact Factor). The data set consists of 125 papers published in 2008 and belonging to the subject category cell biology or immunology. As the results show, Percentile in Subject Area achieves the highest correlation with F1000 ratings; we can assert that for further three other indicators (Times Cited, 2nd Generation Citations, and Category Actual/Expected Citations) the 'true' correlation with the ratings reaches at least a medium effect size.","Bornmann, Lutz;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X04f1619d7;X1424994f0;X2e06a9848;X2ef8a4546;X32d41d9d2;X3404e2d3b;X3c67b9e96;X3e281220e;X6219ca39b;X63aba6843;Xa1b994b71;Xaaca6b13b;Xb0dc10a9d,13,The validation of (advanced) bibliometric indicators through peer assessments: A comparative study using data from InCites and F1000,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1154,2012
828,"Gender disparities appear to be decreasing in academia according to a number of metrics, such as grant funding, hiring, acceptance at scholarly journals, and productivity, and it might be tempting to think that gender inequity will soon be a problem of the past. However, a large-scale analysis based on over eight million papers across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities re- reveals a number of understated and persistent ways in which gender inequities remain. For instance, even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders, close inspection reveals that, in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions. Moreover, women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single-authored papers. Academics should be aware of the subtle ways that gender disparities can appear in scholarly authorship.","West, Jevin D.;Jacquet, Jennifer;King, Molly M.;Correll, Shelley J.;Bergstrom, Carl T.",PLoS ONE,X013c6e792;X03ab63edf;X048640e99;X067cacacc;X07d96066a;X0c1c0fad8;X103425ac5;X12f8e6c7b;X1424994f0;X1bfe13218;X1f03aa6bd;X229e91fe2;X285a458c8;X293ab6c4e;X350e9f941;X3c4b0ebf0;X3ec83ba4f;X3f4474ea4;X40919240b;X45260bd7a;X4955cf3a4;X4a9ca096b;X51b66769f;X561ca2ea3;X5f5dfedd6;X655353254;X6b44a3a1e;X6e1f06c0a;X7248b54d7;X72617f820;X84e468156;X8bd340ef4;X8e6ced7ac;X90b4a4dfe;X933b1aaa4;X933bf6f41;X96a0a25ae;X985b6e56d;X9c12bfc21;X9e2e04236;Xa1840dc21;Xa418d1dc6;Xa70ee2c98;Xab01a1fa1;Xab5ac3292;Xac56a145a;Xb60e330fe;Xbc9f62809;Xbcd42ac20;Xbe6f16eef;Xca3e7688c;Xce691d640;Xce940cf1c;Xcfdc45122;Xd0c88690d;Xd23386e53;Xd6a2c8f70;Xd8b4170df;Xd96b39737;Xd9b1ef027;Xda177ea79;Xdad6086b8;Xdd94923b0;Xe132bbe50;Xe68f13e23;Xe71289a4e;Xe8b77a68e;Xee8290620;Xef8a170ca;Xf212c1960;Xf81825ffc;Xf8ed3c158;Xf970ba3b4;Xfa1084066;Xfa848a6c8;Xfab973073,76,The Role of Gender in Scholarly Authorship,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1759,2013
829,"This paper presents a new framework for adding semantics into e-learning system. The proposed approach relies on two principles. The first principle is the automatic addition of semantic information when creating the mathematical contents. The second principle is the collaborative tagging and annotation of the e-learning contents and the use of an ontology to categorize the e-learning contents. The proposed system encodes the mathematical contents using presentation MathML with RDFa annotations. The system allows students to highlight and annotate specific parts of the e-learning contents. The objective is to add meaning into the e-learning contents, to add relationships between contents, and to create a framework to facilitate searching the contents. This semantic information can be used to answer semantic queries (e.g., SPARQL) to retrieve information request of a user. This work is implemented as an embedded code into Moodle e-learning system.","Abu Doush, Iyad;Alkhateeb, Faisal;Maghayreh, Eslam Al;Alsmadi, Izzat;Samarah, Samer",ArXiv e-prints,X0ed3bd462;X11cf79bd3;X1424994f0;X225fd6d44;X23c9b5ad0;X2a69bb4f9;X2a9e69ddb;X30226269d;X34a16a953;X354753009;X3762ac493;X383ac591f;X38575e34c;X3c1ae418c;X3de8dbc83;X3e78de64b;X416d1adbb;X43a7b7795;X43ec65d73;X4401b1f98;X4804036a3;X495093cc5;X4ba254738;X539f231a8;X573a74a80;X59e22d7e3;X6461d8616;X65c26f040;X69abfe2f2;X69dc64344;X792831853;X961989696;X9631dfde5;Xa78605c5d;Xab3bbe526;Xb713d0a26;Xbdd7cb30b;Xbdfd27768;Xc2180344b;Xc2d515fc3;Xc7c5c6d5b;Xd2bfdad3a;Xd9ffe3dd8;Xdc9fd728d;Xe0ab136d5;Xe66955475;Xe9a7bd2fb;Xea4c72e58;Xeb63db49d;Xedd6262a8;Xeec35cce4;Xf477d87d3;Xf53bfcc52;Xf7309031b,54,"Annotations, Collaborative Tagging, and Searching Mathematics in E-Learning",http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1780,2012

We compare (i) normalization by counting citations in proportion to the length of the reference list (1/N of references) with (ii) rescaling by dividing citation scores by the arithmetic mean of the citation rate of the cluster. Rescaling is analytical and therefore independent of the quality of the attribution to the sets, whereas fractional counting provides an empirical strategy for normalization among sets (by evaluating the between-group variance).

Some diseases have their own characteristics changed rapidly at different places of the world and are reported on documents as unrelated and heterogeneous information which may be going unnoticed and may not be quickly available. This research presents an Ontology based theoretical framework in the context of medical intelligence and country/region. Ontology is designed for storing information about rapidly spreading and changing diseases with incorporating existing disease taxonomies to genetic information of both humans and infectious organisms. It further maps disease symptoms to diseases and drug effects to disease symptoms. The machine understandable disease ontology represented as a website thus allows the drug effects to be evaluated on disease symptoms and exposes genetic involvements in the human diseases. Infectious agents which have no known place in an existing classification but have data on genetics would still be identified as organisms through the intelligence of this system.

835,"Recent studies of urban scaling show that important socioeconomic city characteristics such as wealth and innovation capacity exhibit a nonlinear, particularly a power law scaling with population size. These nonlinear effects are common to all cities, with similar power law exponents. These findings mean that the larger the city, the more disproportionally they are places of wealth and innovation. Local properties of cities cause a deviation from the expected behavior as predicted by the power law scaling. In this paper we demonstrate that universities show a similar behavior as cities in the distribution of the gross university income in terms of total number of citations over size in terms of total number of publications. Moreover, the power law exponents for university scaling are comparable to those for urban scaling. We find that deviations from the expected behavior can indeed be explained by specific local properties of universities, particularly the field-specific composition of a university, and its quality in terms of field-normalized citation impact. By studying both the set of the 500 largest universities worldwide and a specific subset of these 500 universities -- the top-100 European universities -- we are also able to distinguish between properties of universities with as well as without selection of one specific local property, the quality of a university in terms of its average field-normalized citation impact. It also reveals an interesting observation concerning the working of a crucial property in networked systems, preferential attachment.","van Raan, Anthony F.

Compared to the mapping and ranking approaches introduced hitherto, our underlying statistics (multi-level models) are analytically oriented by allowing (1) the estimation of values for the number of excellent papers for an institution which are statistically more appropriate than the observed values; (2) the calculation of confidence intervals as measures of accuracy for the institutional citation impact; (3) the comparison of a single institution with an ""average"" institution in a subject area, and (4) the direct comparison of at least two institutions.","Bornmann, Lutz;Stefaner, Moritz;de Moya Anegon, Felix;Mutz, Ruediger",ArXiv e-prints,5524e948c5;552e073b99;X00624616f;X0132a81eb;X02abfae3c;X02ae88878;X032ace793;X042a050de;X053c7258a;X0635a577e;X07dee1843;X0abaa8f20;X0adada3ee;X0db381e88;X0db56f852;X0dbbb0972;X0e2ca3415;X0eb3a4498;X0f35fca44;X129122d70;X12ab8830b;X15544d7a4;X160273605;X164fc53db;X1793b859d;X186b5e696;X195a39334;X19a86026d;X1a52845fe;X1b428b7a5;X1bad98107;X1c042c328;X1c230ce67;X208037920;X219b3f31b;X22536283a;X23f773098;X24beb5516;X24fe68af1;X259c6008e;X26cb07366;X2797017d3;X27ae97f36;X2822f2666;X2837611ed;X2876e8c4a;X29e70a84f;X2af782b94;X2b6269b9f;X2baf55aeb;X2c7b46496;X2ce5435b7;X2d4246209;X2d733121b;X2d90e5f86;X2d99e0cff;X2e8717b2b;X2ec51b86f;X30d3ed839;X310cb2ee6;X3180fa987;X31a969bb2;X31c5c4933;X323f960f4;X328b461d6;X32fccc2b6;X335ea4223;X34077ab2f;X34582af56;X34af25ddd;X3724e203a;X38c68364e;X38e78e6b0;X391ee52e1;X392b4c695;X3981040fd;X3a2e6b2ec;X3a8b1bec5;X3ac9dfdf2;X3ba6d4c21;X3c552a0bf;X3c9f72cf8;X3cba996c8;X3e416566c;X3f3fe36f6;X3f4780f75;X3f5fb6c98;X3fa42b3e8;X4128105c5;X4180f9621;X427acbf4a;X42b345752;X45227547e;X45a3b7878;X464815e5d;X47b360e9b;X4809b5169;X493cc061e;X4c859fc15;X4d33b2cb4;X4dab67db7;X4dc40fdfb;X50ac0fe5a;X50fe45558;X513b94da1;X522d01027;X527653120;X535c3ac99;X54c0d52a9;X5601e4834;X56b460b41;X5835b067e;X593134b9e;X59c433dd4;X5a5055b87;X5b5943e43;X5b79d5abb;X5cbaa94f0;X5f62ab5ce;X605116e1d;X6121c3b64;X62dfd3b01;X63064095b;X633495a96;X6443eae2f;X64ba45544;X654d7af49;X66252e5d9;X667156333;X67d101ca2;X68a15131f;X6a8a60b60;X6ab314165;X6bf35ad78;X6dd82f173;X6e8d32c53;X701b6afa7;X703731cd3;X70825282a;X744a8d191;X7455ba13e;X74a5c240e;X773487845;X7911a8511;X793a18177;X795d910e4;X796aec832;X79a653482;X7b8106e89;X7c4126f67;X7cf268942;X7d32081a2;X7d4d0bbfd;X7ea807a47;X7eaac11a6;X8056dc693;X82246e16a;X832c524cb;X8542e8e9a;X856f3f430;X860e7c8b4;X86bd1c31d;X8806b4f3f;X89d925290;X89ee005c2;X8b00a6f67;X8b57e1661;X8bff32c02;X8d0c639fc;X8d29d4f1f;X8d5580479;X8d7d7a035;X8dcff7ba7;X8e2a690c9;X8f14776cd;X906d10586;X910ba8224;X91673e475;X925dea8e4;X93624bed2;X94061651d;X94bd3f6d2;X95a9d2602;X961831b25;X964047dc9;X973534652;X979e5a707;X98c3f5ed4;X99a4e299d;X9a199edb3;X9b2040700;X9be62f0ea;X9ce8dd1a6;X9d903d20a;X9f139f660;X9f8331528;Xa009ab697;Xa04054744;Xa0d030ee6;Xa1a747ba4;Xa1b994b71;Xa2b476595;Xa364ac396;Xa41c1cdaf;Xa66f71ea8;Xa7790b755;Xa857558ca;Xa98cf255c;Xaa23decdc;Xaa330ca7c;Xab042afb3;Xabc09915d;Xac8d9eadd;Xad542cd1f;Xad6c77b44;Xad7600542;Xade6a4712;Xae2a51591;Xae9dfc9ad;Xaf5c8d429;Xafa736079;Xb051e108b;Xb0e4d864d;Xb19d4a894;Xb2134af3e;Xb2bdd769f;Xb2d4aa7d4;Xb3083d556;Xb35a0c1cd;Xb35da0802;Xb3e484e1a;Xb53440f30;Xb5584a23a;Xb565f6e99;Xb673bfc17;Xb826874a0;Xb83b87b2a;Xb90c2883c;Xb92cb1028;Xb95ce2d0c;Xb9b63e213;Xbac3e560a;Xbb7ea0c19;Xbc15ae274;Xbcce75ff9;Xbd7b50859;Xbe4e39122;Xbeb526c70;Xc06b203b1;Xc0c0cc99a;Xc12b58a85;Xc13d01325;Xc1b3b5452;Xc3278ceb5;Xc3577d5ab;Xc3a79dbbc;Xc652d6e15;Xc72187756;Xc94aefc02;Xcab52a898;Xcadac7972;Xcc1828d31;Xce5e2ea71;Xcf4418978;Xcfc4bab72;Xd04a5e00f;Xd16ee0ce7;Xd1f0d5d54;Xd20349e6a;Xd2509be5b;Xd2529b5df;Xd2f4caa83;Xd3393bff6;Xd3e88785d;Xd4592b7f6;Xd45ab957a;Xd68fb71de;Xd6a6adf78;Xd78b860ea;Xd84a33797;Xd8a89a2f6;Xd8e0213af;Xd9f4efcd5;Xdac47d76a;Xdc6e996b5;Xdca4b0622;Xdd5063837;Xdde3f30af;Xde20425a8;Xde216e334;Xde26cff03;Xdebf306e0;Xe01f84745;Xe040d8a03;Xe2723d1f6;Xe4d4f2d42;Xe505533c3;Xe7542ca9d;Xe812ffd7a;Xe98670657;Xea0243e89;Xea0c1c5ac;Xea34b8288;Xea51ad472;Xeb531bcdd;Xebbcd470a;Xec360b447;Xec684d17a;Xec6f3e412;Xed190a620;Xed452c095;Xedeea9590;Xeef68815a;Xf1bd0fdf1;Xf28026605;Xf2a63c119;Xf2c150c9a;Xf2f25e27a;Xf3571dabf;Xf36526b9a;Xf54a2cbde;Xf6602a101;Xf6f3bd4e6;Xf75837a6b;Xf7a2b56fa;Xf8a88cef5;Xf98130882;Xfaab2fb2e;Xfd5bac3f3;Xfd8fe58b0;Xfe5527bb2;Xff8edeeae,332,Ranking and mapping of universities and research-focused institutions worldwide based on highly-cited papers: A visualization of results from multi-level models,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0304,2012
843,"Using the referencing patterns in articles in Cognitive Science over three decades, we analyze the knowledge base of this literature in terms of its changing disciplinary composition. Three periods are distinguished: (1) construction of the interdisciplinary space in the 1980s; (2) development of an interdisciplinary orientation in the 1990s; (3) reintegration into ""cognitive psychology"" in the 2000s. The fluidity and fuzziness of the interdisciplinary delineations in the different visualizations can be reduced and clarified using factor analysis. We also explore newly available routines (""CorText"") to analyze this development in terms of ""tubes"" using an alluvial map, and compare the results with an animation (using ""visone""). The historical specificity of this development can be compared with the development of ""artificial intelligence"" into an integrated specialty during this same period. ""Interdisciplinarity"" should be defined differently at the level of journals and of specialties.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Goldstone, Robert L.",ArXiv e-prints,X1c230ce67;X1dce39a51;X3426f3632;X591a89c82;X6c9599846;X6c96edd25;X6f8e6ef20;X766ad9ec4;X78a30222a;X9c08c0d82;Xa2e7b3cfe;Xb06aa336d;Xb11366dcb;Xb17e4cde8;Xcf0bd11e4;Xda7b026af;Xdd43b8880;Xf93aca9f3;Xf9e49cb43;Xfdbdeffd3,20,Interdisciplinarity at the Journal and Specialty Level: The changing knowledge bases of the journal Cognitive Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0823,2012
844,The clustering of text documents in the vector space of semantic fields and in the semantic space with orthogonal basis has been analysed. It is shown that using the vector space model with the basis of semantic fields is effective in the cluster analysis algorithms of author's texts in English fiction. The analysis of the author's texts distribution in cluster structure showed the presence of the areas of semantic space that represent the author's ideolects of individual authors. SVD factorization of the semantic fields matrix makes it possible to reduce significantly the dimension of the semantic space in the cluster analysis of author's texts.,"Pavlyshenko, Bohdan",ArXiv e-prints,X11b3ffaf9;X12570160e;X22056bf06;X48e496fea;X4e94c9a5e;X500fd0c83;X5edddf293;X766ad9ec4;Xb4e450b63;Xb99232667;Xbc183f677;Xcbd535263;Xd493f8a21;Xe08a489bd;Xeec227115;Xf266a0e81,16,The Clustering of Author's Texts of English Fiction in the Vector Space of Semantic Fields,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1478,2012
845,"The launch of Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics may provoke a revolution in the research evaluation field as it places within every researchers reach tools that allow bibliometric measuring. In order to alert the research community over how easily one can manipulate the data and bibliometric indicators offered by Google s products we present an experiment in which we manipulate the Google Citations profiles of a research group through the creation of false documents that cite their documents, and consequently, the journals in which they have published modifying their H index. For this purpose we created six documents authored by a faked author and we uploaded them to a researcher s personal website under the University of Granadas domain. The result of the experiment meant an increase of 774 citations in 129 papers (six citations per paper) increasing the authors and journals H index. We analyse the malicious effect this type of practices can cause to Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics.

846,"By determining which were the most common English words and phrases since the beginning of the 16th century, we obtain a unique large-scale view of the evolution of written text. We find that the most common words and phrases in any given year had a much shorter popularity lifespan in the 16th than they had in the 20th century. By measuring how their usage propagated across the years, we show that for the past two centuries the process has been governed by linear preferential attachment. Along with the steady growth of the English lexicon, this provides an empirical explanation for the ubiquity of the Zipf's law in language statistics and confirms that writing, although undoubtedly an expression of art and skill, is not immune to the same influences of self-organization that are known to regulate processes as diverse as the making of new friends and World Wide Web growth.","Perc, Matjaz",ArXiv e-prints,X0002eb237;X08633bcfb;X086d92316;X0dd89fa3f;X0e7cd9b56;X1116d3c80;X22f63931a;X33230117a;X53b883009;X5655beba8;X6180c0566;X66f6c7a96;X68ab69563;X6e2633271;X724f2303d;X7773503c9;Xa3acb144b;Xbaf4fa45b;Xc2afb61cd;Xce5fa9254;Xcf454b9aa;Xcf5f7076a;Xd86a39ad5;Xde4515194;Xe2d22cd7e;Xf4c8e4af1;Xfc03e0cf6,27,Evolution of the most common English words and phrases over the centuries,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1709,2012
847,"Two commonly used ideas in the development of citation-based research performance indicators are the idea of normalizing citation counts based on a field classification scheme and the idea of recursive citation weighing (like in PageRank-inspired indicators). We combine these two ideas in a single indicator, referred to as the recursive mean normalized citation score indicator, and we study the validity of this indicator. Our empirical analysis shows that the proposed indicator is highly sensitive to the field classification scheme that is used. The indicator also has a strong tendency to reinforce biases caused by the classification scheme. Based on these observations, we advise against the use of indicators in which the idea of normalization based on a field classification scheme and the idea of recursive citation weighing are combined.","Waltman, Ludo;Yan, Erjia;van Eck, Nees Jan",ArXiv e-prints,X0fbc5f5cc;Xa0ef06452;Xa1b994b71;Xd69b98c13;Xf4d07d999,5,A recursive field-normalized bibliometric performance indicator: An application to the field of library and information science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3212,2011

849,"Progress is being made in code discoverability and preservation, but as discussed at ADASS XXI, many codes still remain hidden from public view. With the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) now indexed by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), the introduction of a new journal, Astronomy & Computing, focused on astrophysics software, and the increasing success of education efforts such as Software Carpentry and SciCoder, the community has the opportunity to set a higher standard for its science by encouraging the release of software for examination and possible reuse. We assembled representatives of the community to present issues inhibiting code release and sought suggestions for tackling these factors.The session began with brief statements by panelists; the floor was then opened for discussion and ideas. Comments covered a diverse range of related topics and points of view, with apparent support for the propositions that algorithms should be readily available, code used to produce published scientific results should be made available, and there should be discovery mechanisms to allow these to be found easily. With increased use of resources such as GitHub (for code availability), ASCL (for code discovery), and a stated strong preference from the new journal Astronomy & Computing for code release, we expect to see additional progress over the next few years.","Allen, A.;Berriman, B.;Brunner, R.;Burger, D.;DuPrie, K.;Hanisch, R.

850,Pre-print repositories have seen a significant increase in use over the past fifteen years across multiple research domains. Researchers are beginning to develop applications capable of using these repositories to assist the scientific community above and beyond the pure dissemination of information. The contribution set forth by this paper emphasizes a deconstructed publication model in which the peer-review process is mediated by an OAI-PMH peer-review service. This peer-review service uses a social-network algorithm to determine potential reviewers for a submitted manuscript and for weighting the relative influence of each participating reviewer's evaluations. This paper also suggests a set of peer-review specific metadata tags that can accompany a pre-print's existing metadata record. The combinations of these contributions provide a unique repository-centric peer-review model that fits within the widely deployed OAI-PMH framework.,"Rodriguez, Marko A.;Bollen, Johan;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X0311debca;X30efdc8b4;X505653df0;X63b18899f;X8896fe0a0;X9a6bfde52;X9f66444b4;Xab41dd53c;Xbf5b67d12;Xcc1eef1de;Xf036c8fc0;Xf247ab6e0;Xf9a37d050,13,The Convergence of Digital-Libraries and the Peer-Review Process,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0504084,2005
851,"We discuss a methodology to dynamically generate links among digital objects by means of an unsupervised learning mechanism which analyzes user link traversal patterns. We performed an experiment with a test bed of 150 complex data objects, referred to as buckets. Each bucket manages its own content, provides methods to interact with users and individually maintains a set of links to other buckets. We demonstrate that buckets were capable of dynamically adjusting their links to other buckets according to user link selections, thereby generating a meaningful network of bucket relations. Our results indicate such adaptive networks of linked buckets approximate the collective link preferences of a community of user","Elango, Aravind;Bollen, Johan;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X56135d42e;X563d992d9;X649dd9b87;Xc2fff1b33,4,Dynamic Linking of Smart Digital Objects Based on User Navigation Patterns,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0401029,2004
852,"Many studies demonstrate that there is still a significant gender bias, especially at higher career levels, in many areas including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We investigated field-dependent, gender-specific effects of the selective pressures individuals experience as they pursue a career in academia within seven STEM disciplines. We built a unique database that comprises 437,787 publications authored by 4,292 faculty members at top United States research universities. Our analyses reveal that gender differences in publication rate and impact are discipline-specific. Our results also support two hypotheses. First, the widely-reported lower publication rates of female faculty are correlated with the amount of research resources typically needed in the discipline considered, and thus may be explained by the lower level of institutional support historically received by females. Second, in disciplines where pursuing an academic position incurs greater career risk, female faculty tend to have a greater fraction of higher impact publications than males. Our findings have significant, field-specific, policy implications for achieving diversity at the faculty level within the STEM disciplines.","Duch, Jordi;Zeng, Xiao Han T.;Sales-Pardo, Marta;Radicchi, Filippo;Otis, Shayna;Woodruff, Teresa K.;Nunes Amaral, Luís A.",PLoS ONE,X4a5e83f08;X6e1f06c0a;Xc0548e30c;Xc433d6f75;Xc6d9b3462;Xcafd78314;Xef0f8ba56;Xf129f2820;Xfb53e1d4d,9,The Possible Role of Resource Requirements and Academic Career-Choice Risk on Gender Differences in Publication Rate and Impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3320,2012
853,"The Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL), founded in 1999, is a free on-line registry for source codes of interest to astronomers and astrophysicists. The library is housed on the discussion forum for Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) and can be accessed at <A href=""http://ascl.net"">http://ascl.net</A>. The ASCL has a comprehensive listing that covers a significant number of the astrophysics source codes used to generate results published in or submitted to refereed journals and continues to grow. The ASCL currently has entries for over 500 codes; its records are citable and are indexed by ADS. The editors of the ASCL and members of its Advisory Committee were on hand at a demonstration table in the ADASS poster room to present the ASCL, accept code submissions, show how the ASCL is starting to be used by the astrophysics community, and take questions on and suggestions for improving the resource.","Allen, A.;DuPrie, K.;Berriman, B.;Hanisch, R.

854,"This paper outlines a framework for the study of innovation that treats discoveries as additions to evolving networks. As inventions enter they expand or limit the reach of the ideas they build on by influencing how successive discoveries use those ideas. The approach is grounded in novel measures of the extent to which an innovation amplifies or disrupts the status quo. Those measures index the effects inventions have on subsequent uses of prior discoveries. In so doing, they characterize a theoretically important but elusive feature of innovation. We validate our approach by showing it: (1) discriminates among innovations of similar impact in analyses of U.S. patents; (2) identifies discoveries that amplify and disrupt technology streams in select case studies; (3) implies disruptive patents decrease the use of their predecessors by 60% in difference-in-differences estimation; and, (4) yields novel findings in analyses of patenting at 110 U.S. universities.","Funk, Russell J.;Owen-Smith, Jason",ArXiv e-prints,53eb709347;X12fb13aa7;X327a99c6a;X3f2c0149f;X4327c26be;X52c3b2110;X6c140f6d7;X735983ee7;X97a9a036f;X9f9b5eff0;Xa59f697a4;Xf05d3d849,12,A Dynamic Network Approach to Breakthrough Innovation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3559,2012

In this technical report we present a proof of concept which utilizes Linked Data technology for the simple enrichment of sparse metadata sets. This is done by discovering owl:sameAs links be- tween an initial set of computer science papers and resources from external data sources like DBLP, ACM and the Semantic Web Conference Corpus.

860,"The chapter tackles the role of scholarly publication in the research process (quality, preservation) and looks at the consequences of new information technologies in the organization of the scholarly communication ecology. It will then show how new technologies have had an impact on the scholarly communication process and made it depart from the traditional publishing environment. Developments will address new editorial processes, dissemination of new content and services, as well as the development of publication archives. This last aspect will be covered on all levels (open access, scientific, technical and legal aspects). A view on the possible evolutions of the scientific publishing environment will be provided.","Romary, Laurent",ArXiv e-prints,X00443c0f6;X0aa1bcfbc;X0c28a8e7c;X2abe57279;X2c3a6d121;X424523b0e;X455e85347;X48ea16cdd;X54a9baa26;X5a04023e5;X7b351f24a;X7e5c1258a;X8044ae8c6;X83078d5b8;X8c3a2176a;X922263a43;X9323b33f8;Xa95cd2c01;Xabaf7c79d;Xaca09677d;Xbb879bdc4;Xd124be9ca;Xd43a7380f;Xdb4c7022e;Xe7eb24332;Xeefc508b8;Xfd17bfc61,27,Scholarly Communication,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3287,2011
861,"A bibliometric approach is explored to tracking international scientific migration, based on an analysis of the affiliation countries of authors publishing in peer reviewed journals indexed in Scopus. The paper introduces a model that relates base concepts in the study of migration to bibliometric constructs, and discusses the potentialities and limitations of a bibliometric approach both with respect to data accuracy and interpretation. Synchronous and asynchronous analyses are presented for 10 rapidly growing countries and 7 scientifically established countries. Rough error rates of the proposed indicators are estimated. It is concluded that the bibliometric approach is promising provided that its outcomes are interpreted with care, based on insight into the limits and potentialities of the bibliometric approach, and combined with complementary data, obtained, for instance, from researchers Curricula Vitae or survey or questionnaire based data. Error rates for units of assessment with indicator values based on sufficiently large numbers are estimated to be fairly below 10 per cent, but can be expected to vary substantially among countries of origin, especially between Asian countries and Western countries.","Halevi, Gali;Moed, Henk F.",ArXiv e-prints,X026b830ae;X03ed8ce4c;X05c5d4d26;X09b3bd72d;X187885686;X1cbd248a3;X29e35a6d9;X386d1f4d9;X4401b1f98;X462a3087b;X4b958e62d;X64abe8425;X6eeba02c6;X703c761fd;X76b2432b3;X84640b5e2;X8578ebf06;X87ba40a0d;X8bcea08ec;X9310c8bc7;Xa1b994b71;Xa36ff9639;Xb3510f4e7;Xb50e05f0b;Xc0ec8a279;Xc12a8009b;Xd5d72c3c6;Xdb9b5e921;Xe434d7216;Xe57052b10;Xe8d44bbb7;Xecfbf6735;Xef4ea945e,33,International Scientific Migration and Collaboration Patterns Following a Bibliometrics Line of Investigation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5194,2012

863,"As a social science information service for the German language countries, we document research projects, publications, and data in relevant fields. At the same time, we aim to provide well-founded bibliometric studies of these fields. Performing a citation analysis on an area of the German social sciences is, however, a serious challenge given the low and likely significantly biased coverage of these fields in the standard citation databases. Citations, and especially author citations, play a highly significant role in that literature, however. In this work in progress, we report preliminary methods and results for an author name co-mention analysis of a large fragment of a particularly interesting corpus of German sociology: a quarter century's worth of the full-text proceedings of the Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Soziologie (DGS), which celebrated its 100th anniversary meeting in 2012. Results are encouraging for this poor cousin of author co-citation analysis, but considerable refinements, especially of the underlying computational infrastructure for full-text analysis, appear advisable for full-scale deployment of this method.","Strotmann, Andreas;Bleier, Arnim",ArXiv e-prints,X0dbe94542;X254cedf77;X29bfd89bb;X3e11b0f57;X3e5409c51;X471f0e16d;X69efe3184;X69f6dc8cd;X6ac882fa6;X8b00eb5c3;X9656e2d5c;Xb3e73d1b7;Xc02687cbf;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xcfbbe7c0b;Xe7a5d185d;Xe807ac44a;Xfb63f7e6e,18,Author Name Co-Mention Analysis: Testing a Poor Man's Author Co-Citation Analysis Method,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5256,2013
864,"Automatic classification of scientific articles based on common characteristics is an interesting problem with many applications in digital library and information retrieval systems. Properly organized articles can be useful for automatic generation of taxonomies in scientific writings, textual summarization, efficient information retrieval etc. Generating article bundles from a large number of input articles, based on the associated features of the articles is tedious and computationally expensive task. In this report we propose an automatic two-step approach for topic extraction and bundling of related articles from a set of scientific articles in real-time. For topic extraction, we make use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling techniques and for bundling, we make use of hierarchical agglomerative clustering techniques. We run experiments to validate our bundling semantics and compare it with existing models in use. We make use of an online crowdsourcing marketplace provided by Amazon called Amazon Mechanical Turk to carry out experiments. We explain our experimental setup and empirical results in detail and show that our method is advantageous over existing ones.","Puthiya Parambath, Shameem A",ArXiv e-prints,X03edbeb25;X05a8a5d10;X0611be5ef;X0654b4ce7;X093cd67a1;X1164bacd6;X173a7491f;X18c72c0d4;X193a40f53;X1a76fd33b;X1aeb06f62;X1dc8dfbd7;X1ddd94d14;X21cd19d88;X21dfa3347;X21e51d306;X2ad18f0e4;X2af0a8b8e;X2c0c74f57;X2f22c420c;X33d263fe5;X350d251f3;X3539442ec;X3745ee7dd;X38093820e;X3a13caf0c;X3b290a086;X4327cdc30;X437f25af1;X46913d350;X475ed5f36;X4879ac23e;X491d70893;X4a91583b9;X4adb569a4;X4b619f9bd;X4f2d4b64c;X50b16d1c8;X51d210228;X566be32cb;X584af097b;X595119947;X5b207ecea;X5b6e585ae;X5c3117dc0;X5d4569675;X5d7465436;X5d8f6d076;X5e4272229;X6759c8266;X688751fc9;X68db96647;X71b4a308c;X750765624;X75738e167;X7ef3850d7;X7f1fec077;X8306935ed;X8336ddf99;X838610a3d;X84a92dce2;X84b2d0bf7;X8833d03fa;X8893fa3e7;X88dbfacbd;X8a4360422;X8a9bc5eb3;X8b43dd616;X8c0460cab;X8e1917b23;X91548d652;X945d5fcbd;X96a2cd00d;X981026d39;X9a7e08f3b;X9cfc4317d;Xa922c3785;Xa962a3773;Xab187269d;Xad069d522;Xb023bfc3d;Xb0fb10663;Xb21410bf4;Xbb7ea0af8;Xc01213e6e;Xc0c7caaee;Xc1123efc4;Xc21ec7def;Xc3013c02c;Xc4a67ecf8;Xc8e3b1292;Xcd91796db;Xce6897ee1;Xcf43015cf;Xcfe4498fd;Xd00ddc803;Xd06aa6f83;Xd6f93799d;Xd9d25c12f;Xdccf9b140;Xe09e5fcaf;Xe1da15e79;Xe2a8d0705;Xe3003f4bc;Xe34af34a8;Xe6c5caa94;Xe76cc291d;Xeccedb348;Xefc3fe2b2;Xf59ad9566;Xf886532e8;Xf9e2c60b5;Xfb9a0d962;Xfcf59d468;Xfd9f5129b;Xff911c4a9,116,Topic Extraction and Bundling of Related Scientific Articles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5423,2012

With varying resources, audiences and collection development policies, these archives have varying levels of overlap with each other. While individual archives can be measured in terms of number of URIs, number of copies per URI, and intersection with other archives, to date there has been no answer to the question ""How much of the Web is archived?"" We study the question by approximating the Web using sample URIs from DMOZ, Delicious, Bitly, and search engine indexes; and, counting the number of copies of the sample URIs exist in various public web archives. Each sample set provides its own bias. The results from our sample sets indicate that range from 35%-90% of the Web has at least one archived copy, 17%-49% has between 2-5 copies, 1%-8% has 6-10 copies, and 8%-63% has more than 10 copies in public web archives.

Two repositories with different characteristics, arXiv and the UNT digital library, are studied to determine if the nature of the repository, or of its content, has a bearing on the availability of the web resources cited by that content. Memento makes it possible to automate discovery of archived resources and to consider the time between the publication of the research and the archiving of the referenced URLs. This automation allows us to process more than 160000 URLs, the largest known such study, and the repository metadata allows consideration of the results by discipline. The results are startling: 45% (66096) of the URLs referenced from arXiv still exist, but are not preserved for future generations, and 28% of resources referenced by UNT papers have been lost. Moving forwards, we provide some initial recommendations, including that repositories should publish URL lists extracted from papers that could be used as seeds for web archiving systems.","Sanderson, Robert;Phillips, Mark;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X0e0ec2416;X127911863;X1383442ba;X1717b7cbf;X1d90e9973;X22f63931a;X2a71f2abb;X2dc0798ee;X32108790f;X414cc6a88;X612cb8bee;X6973f7e1b;X6ea0208c4;X7188a8017;X812bc3182;X869289c98;X99b124329;X9faf8e06e;Xa4fd5831e;Xaae6f8bf2;Xb358fdfbb;Xb6b822cc9;Xb7c8cc0c6;Xc107a7be6;Xc5155c7de;Xcb6b1ffc6;Xd36d4983a;Xd44fa74f5;Xf06a45ecf;Xf0fc41d6e;Xf2554aae0;Xfcdd3b361,32,Analyzing the Persistence of Referenced Web Resources with Memento,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3459,2011
870,"A discipline such as business and management (B&M) is very broad and has many fields within it, ranging from fairly scientific ones such as management science or economics to softer ones such as information systems. There are at least two reasons why it is important to identify these sub-fields accurately. Firstly, for the purpose of normalizing citation data as it is well known that citation rates vary significantly between different disciplines. Secondly, because journal rankings and lists tend to split their classifications into different subjects, for example the the Association of Business Schools (ABS) list, which is a standard in the UK, has 22 different fields. Unfortunately, at the moment these are created in an ad hoc manner with no underlying rigour. The purpose of this paper is to identify possible sub-fields in B&M rigorously based on actual citation patterns. We have examined 450 journals in B&M which are included in the ISI Web of Science (WoS) and analysed the cross-citation rates between them enabling us to generate sets of coherent and consistent sub-fields that minimise the extent to which journals appear in several categories.

871,"Word clouds are a popular tool for visualizing documents, but they are not a good tool for comparing documents, because identical words are not presented consistently across different clouds. We introduce the concept of word storms, a visualization tool for analysing corpora of documents. A word storm is a group of word clouds, in which each cloud represents a single document, juxtaposed to allow the viewer to compare and contrast the documents. We present a novel algorithm that creates a coordinated word storm, in which words that appear in multiple documents are placed in the same location, using the same color and orientation, in all of the corresponding clouds. In this way, similar documents are represented by similar-looking word clouds, making them easier to compare and contrast visually. We evaluate the algorithm in two ways: first, an automatic evaluation based on document classification; and second, a user study. The results confirm that unlike standard word clouds, a coordinated word storm better allows for visual comparison of documents.","Castella, Quim;Sutton, Charles",ArXiv e-prints,X0677721ea;X0b1da93b8;X1895c087f;X18af4b834;X2193a49bd;X276219805;X30b3818d8;X3566d494b;X358a0f27a;X378c31abe;X3ae23f35d;X3c42891fa;X46a1cb658;X5348d099e;X633e02643;X670d673b0;X67749bee4;X73218ee55;X770b7e08b;X7b14b884e;X7e5cbef5c;X80342b0dc;X8a01aba0a;X8c310d6ac;X8cc9f22a6;X8eb5a80c2;X900f9603f;X97b49d276;X9b23312bc;Xa3ab1a559;Xaa0f265e4;Xb0dc6e4e6;Xb1e5889f8;Xb28d16a1f;Xb7b48632f;Xb9109b940;Xbf42165ee;Xc009697d9;Xc2fff1b33;Xc6c675de1;Xdb7f859ea;Xdd4d5de07;Xe6e661a37;Xea716ed30;Xed706552a;Xf312aea4d;Xf3a8f6db7;Xf5d4fce97;Xfa15a9646;Xfd3a67d28,50,Word Storms: Multiples of Word Clouds for Visual Comparison of Documents,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0503,2013
872,"The network of international co-authorship relations has been dominated by certain European nations and the USA, but this network is rapidly expanding at the global level.

In this brief communication, we present both a global map with the functionality of a Google Map (zooming, etc.) and network maps based on normalized relations. These maps reveal complementary aspects of the network. International collaboration in the generation of knowledge claims (that is, the context of discovery) changes the structural layering of the sciences. Previously, validation was at the global level and discovery more dependent on local contexts. This changing relationship between the geographical and intellectual dimensions of the sciences also has implications for national science policies.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Wagner, Caroline;Park, Han Woo;Adams, Jonathan",ArXiv e-prints,X00e1301ea;X037f78cbe;X0443bf2b0;X04feb055e;X05b2b3825;X0c5b6d98f;X0ea665769;X10bc7d734;X133c643b1;X196ac7cb2;X1d8b92e9a;X2b5a0b5f7;X2baecc21f;X312c05e20;X337893af5;X35be6adc6;X35dcd8fd1;X3c7b5cbdf;X3e11b0f57;X3e30fc4b3;X3e88037eb;X410240f8e;X418f1c548;X453e6fc93;X45ff54daa;X4c72d6f7c;X522beb475;X542d87025;X55654a3b0;X55a7d70c9;X58b1a6749;X5c3d715b1;X5f2a52273;X651f0a9d8;X65faf30a1;X693626baf;X69bb2701f;X6a2ba74cd;X6c450a664;X6f8862808;X701494627;X72db474e5;X78b28428a;X7aaea10a6;X7af4b43f6;X7b0e23ce8;X7b1abd2c3;X7bf234bf4;X7c1bcf575;X7c239556d;X7f96eeda9;X872b1dea5;X8ed479aa3;X90126d518;X9156758d1;X91e0ed7f0;X93a506fee;X96680b1db;X96cc68cb6;X983acc286;X99bec97b0;X9a4929e37;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa1e58f6e7;Xa32b8cee2;Xa7426ee9e;Xa9f2efeb0;Xaf95f0a06;Xb015b1a73;Xb1b447bb0;Xb28a642b7;Xb4701a8d3;Xb4e9716be;Xb59cbb517;Xb739f61d1;Xb9be3e677;Xbb29b8a28;Xbb860d23d;Xbbabb7525;Xbcd25fd75;Xbcd94af2e;Xbd20432c1;Xbd57ecb50;Xbf4779752;Xc7b3f7fdc;Xcd5dabe9f;Xce2ad17c9;Xd5371c8ff;Xd6b9cd7ad;Xdc3583482;Xe0c1614fd;Xe1dbf1647;Xeb448e8e0;Xeb5bdf4ec;Xec48b67db;Xec8c8aa17;Xeee0cdd19;Xf004dad98;Xf036046f8;Xf081ead8d;Xf2f3647d3;Xf4b22cf71;Xf5f9366e6;Xf7c78ab6a;Xf98130882;Xffe66856b,107,International Collaboration in Science: The Global Map and the Network,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0801,2013
873,"The ongoing functional annotation of proteins relies upon the work of curators to capture experimental findings from scientific literature and apply them to protein sequence and structure data. However, with the increasing use of high-throughput experimental assays, a small number of experimental studies dominate the functional protein annotations collected in databases. Here we investigate just how prevalent is the ""few articles -- many proteins"" phenomenon. We examine the experimentally validated annotation of proteins provided by several groups in the GO Consortium, and show that the distribution of proteins per published study is exponential, with 0.14% of articles providing the source of annotations for 25% of the proteins in the UniProt-GOA compilation. Since each of the dominant articles describes the use of an assay that can find only one function or a small group of functions, this leads to substantial biases in what we know about the function of many proteins. Mass-spectrometry, microscopy and RNAi experiments dominate high throughput experiments. Consequently, the functional information derived from these experiments is mostly of the subcellular location of proteins, and of the participation of proteins in embryonic developmental pathways. For some organisms, the information provided by different studies overlap by a large amount. We also show that the information provided by high throughput experiments is less specific than those provided by low throughput experiments. Given the experimental techniques available, certain biases in protein function annotation due to high-throughput experiments are unavoidable. Knowing that these biases exist and understanding their characteristics and extent is important for database curators, developers of function annotation programs, and anyone who uses protein function annotation data to plan experiments.","Schnoes, Alexandra M.;Ream, David C.;Thorman, Alexander W.;Babbitt, Patricia C.;Friedberg, Iddo",PLoS Computational Biology,X032dfbd7d;X1e11fba4c;X43a9718d2;X4d52498a1;X581072f81;X664ea2547;X697cb0ad8;X7aad426bd;Xa3411b82c;Xb9a524826;Xbfa3fb9c8,11,Biases in the Experimental Annotations of Protein Function and Their Effect on Our Understanding of Protein Function Space,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1740,2013
874,"Using ""Analyze Results"" at the Web of Science, one can directly generate overlays onto global journal maps of science. The maps are based on the 10,000+ journals contained in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) of the Science and Social Science Citation Indices (2011). The disciplinary diversity of the retrieval is measured in terms of Rao-Stirling's ""quadratic entropy."" Since this indicator of interdisciplinarity is normalized between zero and one, the interdisciplinarity can be compared among document sets and across years, cited or citing. The colors used for the overlays are based on Blondel et al.'s (2008) community-finding algorithms operating on the relations journals included in JCRs. The results can be exported from VOSViewer with different options such as proportional labels, heat maps, or cluster density maps. The maps can also be web-started and/or animated (e.g., using PowerPoint). The ""citing"" dimension of the aggregated journal-journal citation matrix was found to provide a more comprehensive description than the matrix based on the cited archive. The relations between local and global maps and their different functions in studying the sciences in terms of journal litteratures are further discussed: local and global maps are based on different assumptions and can be expected to serve different purposes for the explanation.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Rafols, Ismael;Chen, Chaomei",ArXiv e-prints,X00645a85c;X011bff5d2;X023a911d2;X1a90e9cbe;X2413d146d;X3685f6982;X3f7f957f1;X473636b3f;X4ef313a69;X50fe45558;X555283037;X5a02c272e;X5b670caa4;X7795b852b;X7ded7541d;X893957246;X8d86f3ff9;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa2613e5fb;Xb06aa336d;Xb207c6ed4;Xc1019fb06;Xc1b10b95a;Xd04744858;Xe6f318b7d;Xead073569;Xec77fe12e;Xf25f2a8ad,29,Interactive Overlays of Journals and the Measurement of Interdisciplinarity on the basis of Aggregated Journal-Journal Citations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1013,2013

According to Williams (2012) an empirical study should be concerned with the substantive and practical significance of the findings as well as the sign and statistical significance of effects. In this study we will explain what adjusted predictions and marginal effects are and how useful they are for institutional evaluative bibliometrics. As an illustration, we will calculate a regression model using publications (and citation data) produced by four universities in German-speaking countries from 1980 to 2010. We will show how these predictions and effects can be estimated and plotted, and how this makes it far easier to get a practical feel for the substantive meaning of results in evaluative bibliometric studies.

879,"The central dogma of molecular biology, formulated more than five decades ago, compartmentalized information exchange in the cell into the DNA, RNA and protein domains. This formalization has served as an implicit thematic distinguisher for cell biological research ever since. However, a clear account of the distribution of research across this formalization over time does not exist. Abstracts of 〉3.5 million publications focusing on the cell from 1975 to 2011 were analyzed for the frequency of 100 single-word DNA-, RNA- and protein-centric search terms and amalgamated to produce domain- and subdomain-specific trends. A preponderance of protein- over DNA- and in turn over RNA-centric terms as a percentage of the total word count is evident until the early 1990s, at which point the trends for protein and DNA begin to coalesce while RNA percentages remain relatively unchanged. This term-based census provides a yearly snapshot of the distribution of research interests across the three domains of the central dogma of molecular biology. A frequency chart of the most dominantly-studied elements of the periodic table is provided as an addendum.","Ehsani, Sepehr",ArXiv e-prints,X1a9ffd56b;X2aea507e4;X39a331ef4;X4bed542d1;X9e245b3d0;Xaaafd1151;Xeb3b8b6a0,7,Macro-trends in research on the central dogma of molecular biology,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2397,2013
880,"The concept of Science 2.0 was introduced almost a decade ago to describe the new generation of online-based tools for researchers allowing easier data sharing, collaboration and publishing. Although technically sound, the concept still does not work as expected. Here we provide a systematic line of arguments to modify the concept of Science 2.0, making it more consistent with the spirit and traditions of science and Internet. Our first correction to the Science 2.0 paradigm concerns the open-access publication models charging fees to the authors. As discussed elsewhere, we show that the monopoly of such publishing models increases biases and inequalities in the representation of scientific ideas based on the author's income. Our second correction concerns post-publication comments online, which are all essentially non-anonymous in the current Science 2.0 paradigm. We conclude that scientific post-publication discussions require special anonymization systems. We further analyze the reasons of the failure of the current post-publication peer-review models and suggest what needs to be changed in Science 3.0 to convert Internet into a large journal club.","Teif, Vladimir B.",ArXiv e-prints,X014b344b3;X09cb2f721;X0db22327e;X1114092b5;X1220165e6;X12cde8a4a;X1a4336dca;X20f19cd8d;X341c68357;X387b4e3ed;X38d7ec833;X457eab561;X4d19fba47;X4f8d315c0;X580b13d05;X62b2bd911;X6cef4d3d9;X6d53e8d32;X6f64c07ab;X798c4910f;X7e04b9b30;X8019f7279;X82d113955;X83b9e0fec;X87dfd5f75;X8b86b7577;X8c492e948;X93f32a0f8;Xa5010ebb7;Xaa10439bd;Xb11fb357c;Xb199f0314;Xb7ff68304;Xb9996d044;Xbad1db7bc;Xc01e624af;Xc31dfef8d;Xc4c0ad844;Xc5cb2ea61;Xdb28d78ca;Xe033c6179;Xe650a1aee;Xe9f1456bf;Xed45bb82e;Xeeabb8236;Xf3bc1fa73;Xff5a710e7,47,Science 3.0: Corrections to the Science 2.0 paradigm,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2522,2013

882,"Most researchers acknowledge an intrinsic hierarchy in the scholarly journals ('journal rank') that they submit their work to, and adjust not only their submission but also their reading strategies accordingly. On the other hand, much has been written about the negative effects of institutionalizing journal rank as an impact measure. So far, contributions to the debate concerning the limitations of journal rank as a scientific impact assessment tool have either lacked data, or relied on only a few studies. In this review, we present the most recent and pertinent data on the consequences of our current scholarly communication system with respect to various measures of scientific quality (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings or retractions). These data corroborate previous hypotheses: using journal rank as an assessment tool is bad scientific practice. Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact. Therefore, we suggest that abandoning journals altogether, in favor of a library-based scholarly communication system, will ultimately be necessary. This new system will use modern information technology to vastly improve the filter, sort and discovery functions of the current journal system.","Brembs, Björn;Munafò, Marcus",ArXiv e-prints,X02739c20e;X027b4ff12;X0349691ba;X042c7a307;X04ae90a54;X04af98486;X05aea69ad;X06e348e51;X06f0c6961;X0792ad8ab;X08366afd6;X08852f633;X094f47db4;X096db9e9a;X0c3135283;X0ce3af21d;X0d19e2538;X0df2583be;X0e5f2e781;X0eb24c637;X0fac0db83;X1006995f5;X1382851d3;X13ec7eca3;X14b201590;X16b470e4e;X178e14a5a;X1868098db;X190275f2a;X196fe90d4;X19c119620;X1a93ce2b0;X1ab74ef6f;X1b169b5a9;X1b336a80d;X1b50197dc;X1b9ed3f05;X1c86f16f8;X1cf89f3da;X1ea66a171;X1ec08430e;X2049d0a1c;X22a730eff;X22fda69f5;X230559f5e;X235fbdcd3;X236397d16;X24125ad11;X24514e78d;X2569079a5;X26714b3ed;X26c4b67fc;X2714cefac;X27eb8ff97;X2812e566f;X2887940a2;X28fd9ef89;X29c98aae9;X2a23b9280;X2a433afc8;X2a5783cef;X2b29f7973;X2b9d276f3;X2ba2368a6;X2c4869067;X2cef77c68;X30aefda23;X30fa7b7d5;X31c33cb36;X3237d6a6d;X34ce9201e;X362e60f42;X372357ddc;X381d093bf;X399150122;X3a908ccb9;X3a9872e23;X3ac57660f;X3ada972db;X3b54398b1;X3bd506d37;X3c336b0ae;X3fd2f8e1f;X41b139a8b;X41c945b47;X42a56f5a5;X43007d150;X434a0c77a;X4373fa53f;X439faac10;X441234599;X4571f1dcc;X462268544;X463ea22e3;X4663cc96e;X46fb365cf;X47a6d297c;X480fef389;X4a5c2ebd5;X4ab2e9f7a;X4b0e47804;X4b2dc114b;X4b6e5abc5;X4bbc06252;X4bbe442c1;X4bd71dc1a;X4ebb2bcb8;X4f0f79db4;X4f8a796de;X4fc6b051a;X5048c6ed6;X513d9b57a;X52b77e45d;X52e95956b;X5568fd03a;X57ffc3280;X5a3293b91;X5b0179a1b;X5b4a25be5;X5b54839f0;X5bc7c6eb6;X5cb7aa224;X5d152a4d3;X5d21e31d8;X5dcee7c04;X5e00576cd;X616865e13;X621185263;X63b46736b;X642b8dfe9;X65a7e0b26;X68394a43c;X697f36432;X69e140b5b;X6a8aba964;X6ab06444c;X6d9e77770;X6e17ba375;X6e3180196;X6ea568c56;X6ebea7a2a;X708855aed;X722460e9d;X72275b5f6;X75206a9d0;X759e409ca;X76a994425;X785946d53;X787aa476d;X78e33dcb5;X79e3ec689;X7b29faf3b;X7b5ffd977;X7ca4d0141;X7d77a134a;X7e66bb521;X7f2702d26;X811c2d331;X831a9da15;X8338ce21e;X838f37c28;X842f3af09;X8500a87cc;X862393aef;X86c487c6e;X87963ef8f;X8806b4f3f;X8884ff3c5;X890fb10a6;X89543f41c;X89c6b8ccf;X8ac6b51bc;X8bc1115d4;X8c10ec04e;X8c30f5ec9;X8d2a88dda;X8e30ea7de;X8f09c5ee0;X8f0db6792;X8fcf162a6;X903acdc0d;X91335fa85;X91d5e70fc;X91e7eafe5;X924b4002a;X9306b4951;X933fbd237;X93c3258b6;X949aa2726;X950682206;X95279feb5;X95bdf1a64;X961ffff9d;X9859ebffa;X9894090bc;X9baa17bcd;X9bb610b9a;X9c54b5db4;X9c680601f;X9cf2c1805;X9db51b554;X9de81cc6d;X9edcb3a18;X9f4666485;X9f8d0796f;Xa049ebcf1;Xa0f847f3a;Xa13567c96;Xa17e30076;Xa19fab353;Xa1d3a60b5;Xa2cba9936;Xa2fcb9639;Xa33125b21;Xa34606fb6;Xa3755ce5c;Xa411cd781;Xa41a9b703;Xa4a8ac029;Xa5ef443f0;Xa6b1dcebe;Xa7954f66c;Xa8833acf1;Xa8c68a551;Xa8df71879;Xa8f2225b0;Xa94446bfe;Xa944a60d7;Xac78de7f7;Xad752ad2b;Xad9a27337;Xae70d4a2c;Xb0e2b9246;Xb1ae3a2ed;Xb3bc20156;Xb67948f0a;Xb775dfb2c;Xb92c0ef6b;Xb95edd92d;Xb98f65f79;Xbae9bc411;Xbbe37e418;Xbcda2cea0;Xbdb61e4ea;Xbdd430b2c;Xbdf401fe4;Xbfc7b30b5;Xbfe8fe23d;Xc0062a643;Xc015fa00f;Xc02982ee0;Xc11ee9693;Xc1d396b74;Xc2b582add;Xc30833772;Xc394a6e7b;Xc5157ea3c;Xc51c73e26;Xc596ea793;Xc68c8d4ae;Xc6fec0dfb;Xc7815c251;Xc7f4d8c88;Xc9743f8cd;Xc9da4f352;Xcafadfc96;Xcb3b8c879;Xcb8350a93;Xcbb535e00;Xcd632c509;Xcd6ce1d91;Xce8ec583e;Xcf7bdb0ef;Xcfac03818;Xd0420a9ae;Xd0f14a831;Xd10514e10;Xd1604960a;Xd187ba77e;Xd33d80fda;Xd4ca08d5e;Xd4e423985;Xd62d51137;Xd64163618;Xd70ea5e46;Xd77c7f85d;Xd785e0812;Xd7ce3c639;Xda4989732;Xda6474042;Xda8221c6f;Xdaff74a20;Xdb7f6b64a;Xdc2ee79f4;Xdcb084cad;Xdccaa1f73;Xde9c2bda9;Xdecbfa8db;Xdee670c75;Xdfdbddc56;Xe0137c946;Xe14a5cd73;Xe18a9d343;Xe1b767be1;Xe2ef24641;Xe38a819c3;Xe41df03c7;Xe55f2fe73;Xe66f79282;Xe6cb6b4fd;Xe90af35e4;Xea1a770c1;Xec65212e4;Xeddf3db68;Xee331ddd3;Xef1c281fa;Xef6bb0e38;Xf043767f0;Xf08a39468;Xf12656158;Xf2965e0cc;Xf2de8a627;Xf3511629c;Xf356bf6ba;Xf4e01041f;Xf56b834e3;Xf59c90b04;Xf5fbf77de;Xf60d23b73;Xf63fe0ce5;Xf6ab1c973;Xf75c2237d;Xf80d0119e;Xf877ccc6d;Xfb7e74f61;Xfbe25f235;Xfc4752188;Xfd23eb0b2;Xfdff4ac58;Xffebe2cee,340,Deep Impact: Unintended consequences of journal rank,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3748,2013
883,"The data underlying scientific papers should be accessible to researchers both now and in the future, but how best can we ensure that these data are available? Here we examine the effectiveness of four approaches to data archiving: no stated archiving policy, recommending (but not requiring) archiving, and two versions of mandating data deposition at acceptance. We control for differences between data types by trying to obtain data from papers that use a single, widespread population genetic analysis, STRUCTURE. At one extreme, we found that mandated data archiving policies that require the inclusion of a data availability statement in the manuscript improve the odds of finding the data online almost a thousand-fold compared to having no policy. However, archiving rates at journals with less stringent policies were only very slightly higher than those with no policy at all.

We address this question in the context of bibliometric indices that aim to assess the scientific impact of individual researchers by counting their number of highly cited publications. We propose a simple model in which the number of citations of a publication depends not only on the scientific impact of the publication but also on other 'random' factors. Our model indicates that more need not always be better. It turns out that the most influential researchers may have a systematically lower performance, in terms of highly cited publications, than some of their less influential colleagues. The model also suggests an improved way of counting highly cited publications.","Waltman, Ludo;van Eck, Nees Jan;Wouters, Paul",ArXiv e-prints,X1d408a9f6;X3513c3093;X3eb4ee9f4;X8090c007b;X89b58eee2;Xa1b994b71;Xbaadefec4;Xd1b73bd4b;Xdad6086b8;Xdcf416fae;Xf21823188,11,Counting publications and citations: Is more always better?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4597,2013

887,"When a user views an archived page using the archive's user interface (UI), the user selects a datetime to view from a list. The archived web page, if available, is then displayed. From this display, the web archive UI attempts to simulate the web browsing experience by smoothly transitioning between archived pages. During this process, the target datetime changes with each link followed; drifting away from the datetime originally selected. When browsing sparsely-archived pages, this nearly-silent drift can be many years in just a few clicks. We conducted 200,000 acyclic walks of archived pages, following up to 50 links per walk, comparing the results of two target datetime policies. The Sliding Target policy allows the target datetime to change as it does in archive UIs such as the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The Sticky Target policy, represented by the Memento API, keeps the target datetime the same throughout the walk. We found that the Sliding Target policy drift increases with the number of walk steps, number of domains visited, and choice (number of links available). However, the Sticky Target policy controls temporal drift, holding it to less than 30 days on average regardless of walk length or number of domains visited. The Sticky Target policy shows some increase as choice increases, but this may be caused by other factors. We conclude that based on walk length, the Sticky Target policy generally produces at least 30 days less drift than the Sliding Target policy.","Ainsworth, Scott G.;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X05a8a5d10;X1264ae55a;X18c72c0d4;X3731f6811;X4f90cbfbe;X563d992d9;X5a32fd1f5;X5cacc23cf;X5cb802067;X785816b7e;X7afecb6a1;X7be1c4aac;X82e83435b;X83b9e0fec;X94b94bb17;X9cfc4317d;Xdcff41490;Xf03fbbf0e;Xf7626990a,19,Evaluating Sliding and Sticky Target Policies by Measuring Temporal Drift in Acyclic Walks Through a Web Archive,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5503,2013

First, how to identify the elements in the text in order to extract objects that match with the recommendation's criteria presented? Second, How to define the structure of these objects, relationships and articles in order to provide a source of knowledge usable by the extraction process to produce new knowledge from articles?

889,"This study introduces a method based on link analysis to investigate the structure of the R&D support infrastructure associated with science parks in order to determine whether this webometric approach gives plausible results. Three science parks from Yorkshire and the Humber in the UK were analysed with webometric and social network analysis techniques. Interlinking networks were generated through the combination of two different data sets extracted from three sources (Yahoo!, Bing, SocSciBot). These networks suggest that institutional sectors, representing business, universities and public bodies, are primarily tied together by a core formed by research institutions, support structure organisations and business developers. The comparison of the findings with traditional indicators suggests that the web-based networks reflect the offline conditions and policy measures adopted in the region, giving some evidence that the webometric approach is plausible to investigating science park networks. This is the first study that applies a web-based approach to investigate to what extent the science parks facilitate a closer interaction between the heterogeneous organisations that converge in R&D networks. This indicates that link analysis may help to get a first insight into the organisation of the R&D support infrastructure provided by science parks.","Minguillo, David;Thelwall, Mike",ArXiv e-prints,X065f752ef;X1d3459bbb;X25d60accb;X285dd437c;X289244ebc;X2e6922675;X2e83b321a;X32ffe9d4f;X34429d7a0;X377e39486;X37e819a08;X468134764;X4e12d5608;X4edeecac7;X5ca7eea72;X5d9a4d56a;X5ebdbef9e;X64140550d;X6a42911cb;X6d8b68b48;X6fc6944d8;X74c1e3117;X775406a51;X78c4096f4;X7dac9019f;X85fa21b88;X90486002a;X999225dd5;X9f203fb63;X9f52619fb;Xa1b994b71;Xa6100c91d;Xa8e113ac0;Xac8c92160;Xb2aacd53b;Xb3790d449;Xbeff659d4;Xc8748143b;Xcb0113618;Xcc25fcf2d;Xd2529b5df;Xd62677c95;Xd8cfedc62;Xe4d95000b;Xe81b2cc80;Xeb0573d3c;Xf38eae7e9;Xf431d3ef2;Xfe5dc5194,49,Mapping the network structure of science parks: An exploratory study of cross-sectoral interactions reflected on the web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4933,2013

891,"We address the question how citation-based bibliometric indicators can best be normalized to ensure fair comparisons between publications from different scientific fields and different years. In a systematic large-scale empirical analysis, we compare a traditional normalization approach based on a field classification system with three source normalization approaches. We pay special attention to the selection of the publications included in the analysis. Publications in national scientific journals, popular scientific magazines, and trade magazines are not included. Unlike earlier studies, we use algorithmically constructed classification systems to evaluate the different normalization approaches. Our analysis shows that a source normalization approach based on the recently introduced idea of fractional citation counting does not perform well. Two other source normalization approaches generally outperform the classification-system-based normalization approach that we study. Our analysis therefore offers considerable support for the use of source-normalized bibliometric indicators.","Waltman, Ludo;van Eck, Nees Jan",ArXiv e-prints,X0945c4558;X218b5be39;X30f761c6e;X35069d5d0;X3de472bb6;X55a7d70c9;X56a6fda14;X6520d43bd;X68051e5c5;X6dc8079ed;X72d2dfaa1;X7e9a514c5;X97745b5ce;Xa1b994b71;Xb008f31f7;Xb0895292a;Xb1baffc6c;Xc3733d4f0;Xf247ab6e0;Xfcd436160,20,A systematic empirical comparison of different approaches for normalizing citation impact indicators,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4941,2013

893,"Recent discussion about the increase in international research collaboration suggests a comprehensive global network centred around a group of core countries and driven by generic socio-economic factors where the global system influences all national and institutional outcomes. In counterpoint, we demonstrate that the collaboration pattern for countries in Africa is far from universal. Instead, it exhibits layers of internal clusters and external links that are explained not by monotypic global influences but by regional geography and, perhaps even more strongly, by history, culture and language. Analysis of these bottom-up, subjective, human factors is required in order to provide the fuller explanation useful for policy and management purposes.","Adams, Jonathan;Gurney, Karen;Hook, Daniel;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X08366afd6;X086feee10;X12da4409e;X15043d35b;X52634db10;X52692976c;X59409c289;X59e4f0e2a;X65de9b513;X6eb2e1e7e;X70b7abed5;X743b72074;X84c69c3bf;X8c8f72767;Xa5090a203;Xac75a700a;Xaf60fef63;Xb345b00bb;Xc68e32261;Xcaaa91bca;Xd299b1115;Xe7a5d185d;Xf35508cd0,23,International collaboration clusters in Africa,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5159,2013
894,"The study of science at the individual micro-level frequently requires the disambiguation of author names. The creation of author's publication oeuvres involves matching the list of unique author names to names used in publication databases. Despite recent progress in the development of unique author identifiers, e.g., ORCID, VIVO, or DAI, author disambiguation remains a key problem when it comes to large-scale bibliometric analysis using data from multiple databases. This study introduces and validates a new methodology called seed+expand for semi-automatic bibliographic data collection for a given set of individual authors. Specifically, we identify the oeuvre of a set of Dutch full professors during the period 1980-2011. In particular, we combine author records from the National Research Information System (NARCIS) with publication records from the Web of Science. Starting with an initial list of 8,378 names, we identify ""seed publications"" for each author using five different approaches. Subsequently, we ""expand"" the set of publication in three different approaches. The different approaches are compared and resulting oeuvres are evaluated on precision and recall using a ""gold standard"" dataset of authors for which verified publications in the period 2001-2010 are available.","Reijnhoudt, Linda;Costas, Rodrigo;Noyons, Ed;Boerner, Katy;Scharnhorst, Andrea",ArXiv e-prints,54c8cb09ce;X0954e8445;X18bff2d9d;X19aee4d5c;X1b383b590;X3e11b0f57;X435acf624;X46861939d;X49877bb3b;X582597546;X5a72e6a96;X6df487472;X6e996bbc9;X706e9fa47;X762edc11f;X76b2432b3;X7c42e8ee0;X854b3e855;X8633005c7;X98f871236;Xa021ad1d0;Xa04b5f2c9;Xa1b994b71;Xa68f12ebd;Xa8fd799ef;Xaa102cf3d;Xc3487c961;Xce1afae47;Xd29b4fa71;Xd41cb1166;Xd654661b6;Xd78419860;Xe36e5e5fb;Xf68c53206;Xf70bfab02;Xfabeaae36,36,"""Seed+Expand"": A validated methodology for creating high quality publication oeuvres of individual researchers",http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5177,2013

900,"Whether a scientific paper is cited is related not only to the influence of its author(s) but also to the journal publishing it. Scientists, either proficient or less experienced, usually submit their most important work to prestigious journals which receive more citations than others. How to model the role of scientific journals in citation dynamics is of great importance. In this paper we address this issue through two approaches. One is the intrinsic heterogeneity of a paper determined by the impact factor of the journal publishing it. The other is the mechanism of a paper being cited which depends on its citations and prestige. We develop a model for citation networks via an intrinsic nodal weight function and an intuitive aging mechanism. The node’s weight is drawn from the distribution of impact factors of journals and the aging transition is a function of the citation and the prestige. The node-degree distribution of resulting networks shows nonuniversal scaling: the distribution decays exponentially for small degree and has a power-law tail for large degree, hence the dual behavior. The higher the impact factor of the journal, the larger the tipping point and the smaller the power exponent that are obtained. With the increase of the journal rank, this phenomenon will fade and evolve to pure power laws.","Yao, Zheng;Peng, Xiao-Long;Zhang, Li-Jie;Xu, Xin-Jian",Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment,X0d74db05f;X169dc448d;X191731d5e;X2177570ef;X26a74ae62;X2c4f74bf2;X38b0780b3;X413faa55f;X4a9173139;X662d03254;X69ec8982b;X6c0f3fa78;X8095a04c2;Xa1d7b19e8;Xb0c4eb841;Xb4cce4e6a;Xc6d82030e;Xe413c52ea;Xe676c2b33;Xee10c0e3b;Xf0c9689b0,21,Modeling nonuniversal citation distributions: the role of scientific journals,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5680,2014
901,"Presents the result of the calculated IS! equivalent Impact Factor, Relative Diffusion Factor (RDF), and Journal Diffusion Factor (JDF) for articles published in the Medical Journal of Malaysia (MJM) between the years 2004 and 2008 in both their synchronous and diachronous versions. The publication data are collected from MyAis (Malaysian Abstracting & Indexing system) while the citation data are collected from Google Scholar. The values of the synchronous JDF ranges from 0.057 - 0.14 while the diachronous JDF ranges from 0.46 - 1.98. The high diachronous JDF is explained by a relatively high number of different citing journals against the number of publications. This implies that the results of diachronous JDF is influenced by the numbers of publications and a good comparison may be one of which the subject of analysis have similar number of publications and citations period. The yearly values of the synchronous RDF vary in the range of 0.66 - 1.00 while diachronous RDF ranges from 0.62 - 0.88. The result shows that diachronous RDF is negatively correlated with the number of citations, resulting in a low RDF value for highly cited publication years. What this implies in practice is that the diffusion factors can be calculated for every additional year at any journal level of analysis. This study demonstrates that these indicators are valuable tools that help to show development of journals as it changes through time.","Sanni, S. A.;Zainab, A.

904,"This study examines the literature on library security and collection security to identify factors to be considered to develop a collection security management assessment instrument for university libraries. A ""house"" model was proposed consisting of five factors; collection security governance, operations and processes, people issues, physical and technical issues and the security culture in libraries. An assessment instrument listing items covering the five factors was pilot tested on 61 samples comprising chief librarians, deputy librarians, departmental, sectional heads and professional staff working in four university libraries in Nigeria. The level of security implementation is assessed on a scale of 1=not-implemented, 2=planning stage, 3=partial implementation, 4=close to completion, and 5=full implementation. The instrument was also tested for reliability. Reliability tests indicate that all five factors are reliable with Cronbach's alpha values between 0.7 and 0.9, indicating that the instrument can be used for wider distribution to explore and assess the level of collection security implementation in university libraries from a holistic perspective.","Maidabino, A.

905,"The paper describes an extensible model for implementing a user-centered, customizable interface to a library's collection of information resources. This model, called MyLibrary, integrates the principles of librarianship (collection, organization, dissemination, and evaluation) with globally networked computing resources creating a dynamic, customer-driven front-end to any library's set of materials. The model supports a framework for libraries to provide enhanced access to local and remote sets of data, information, and knowledge. At the same, the model does not overwhelm its users with too much information because the users control exactly how much information is displayed to them at any given time. The model is active and not passive; direct human interaction, computer mediated guidance and communication technologies, as well as current awareness services all play indispensable roles in this system.","Lease Morgan, Eric",ArXiv e-prints,X13c29ff13;X19420e4e4;X43f597149;X59ff7e023;X64cd2ce0e;X6daa57896;X9e02d3a20;Xc30e9d570;Xcbe04d5a2,9,"MyLibrary: A Model for Implementing a User-centered, Customizable Interface to a Library's Collection of Information Resources",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902003,1999
906,"We discuss long-term preservation of and access to relational databases. The focus is on national archives and science data archives which have to ingest and integrate data from a broad spectrum of vendor-specific relational database management systems (RDBMS). Furthermore, we present our solution SIARD which analyzes and extracts data and data logic from almost any RDBMS. It enables, to a reasonable level of authenticity, complete detachment of databases from their vendor-specific environment. The user can add archival descriptive metadata according to a customizable schema. A SIARD database archive integrates data, data logic, technical metadata, and archival descriptive information in one archival information package, independent of any specific software and hardware, based upon plain text files and the standardized languages SQL and XML. For usage purposes, a SIARD archive can be reloaded into any current or future RDBMS which supports standard SQL. In addition, SIARD contains a client that enables 'on demand' reload of archives into a target RDBMS, and multi-user remote access for querying and browsing the data together with its technical and descriptive metadata in one graphical user interface.","Heuscher, Stephan;Jaermann, Stephan;Keller-Marxer, Peter;Moehle, Frank",ArXiv e-prints,X035b7ee6c;X0bb9b54e0;X17d93063d;X1af70b6d0;X1bc342170;X1d2d82e2d;X2cf0d2aac;X2ee47d85d;X3907e972a;X3a969c694;X3b4d519ee;X3df9e8470;X47f8662d4;X5822384cb;X59174c492;X6677b5eb9;X6a8124fc1;X6c5ae1fc6;X7bb7c8c91;X7e734db82;X804211506;X83dc4ee67;X84a92dce2;X8f4493d75;Xadd704ea2;Xb2e480807;Xbd272d08e;Xbf8bbf14f;Xd62c4135f;Xd958c4576;Xda050b68f;Xe279ca156;Xe76cc291d;Xf16ec38f0;Xf7626990a;Xfe0dcd017;Xfeaf6c857,37,Providing Authentic Long-term Archival Access to Complex Relational Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0408054,2004

The performance of Malaysian OA repositories and journals is highlighted. The strength of OA channels in increasing visibility and citations are evidenced by research findings. It is proposed that libraries champion OA initiatives by making university or institutional governance aware; encouraging institutional journal publishers to adopt OA platform; collaborating with research groups to jumpstart OA institutional initiatives and to embed OA awareness into user and researcher education programmes. By actively involved, libraries will be free of permission, licensing and archiving barriers usually imposed in traditional publishing situation.","Zainab, A.

909,"The internationalization characteristics of two Malaysian journals, Bulletin of the Malaysian Mathematical Sciences Society (indexed by ISI) and the Malaysian Journal of Computer Science (indexed by Inspec and Scopus) is observed. All issues for the years 2000 to 2007 were looked at to obtain the following information, (i) total articles published between 2000 and 2007; (ii) the distribution of foreign and Malaysian authors publishing in the journals; (iii) the distribution of articles by country and (iv) the geographical distribution of authors citing articles published in the journals. Citation to articles is derived from information given by Google scholar. The results indicate that both journals exhibit average internationalization characteristics as they are current in their publications but with between 19% -30% international composition of reviewers or editorials, publish between 36%-79% of foreign articles and receive between 60%-70% of citations from foreign authors.","Zainab, A.

910,"This paper describes the digital library of historical resources, a research project which involves building a testbed for the purpose of developing and testing new collaborative digital library functionality and presents an initial analysis of the digital library's public use on the web. The digital library is modeled to focus on serving secondary students information needs in conducting history projects. As such, in the implementation of the digital library, the use of online resources would be an integral part of history project based learning activities. Students should be enabled to access digital resources, create and publish their own documents in the digital library and share them with others. As a testbed system, the collaborative digital library known as CoreDev has demonstrated its capabilities in serving an educational community as has been reflected by the positive feedback on the functional requirements from 44 users. Over 75% of the respondents in the user survey considered themselves capable of using the digital library easily. The beta tester demographics (n = 105) indicate that the digital library is reaching its target communities.","Abdullah, A.;Zainab, A.

911,"This exploratory study focuses on identifying the usage pattern of e-books especially on how, when, where and why undergraduates at the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT), University of Malaya (UM), Kuala Lumpur use or do not use the e-books service provided by the University of Malaya library. A total of 206 (82%) useable questionnaires form the basis of analysis. The results indicate even though the students are heavy users of the Internet, rate themselves as skilled in Internet use and have positive attitude towards the e-book service, the level of e-book use is still low (39%). The students become aware of the e-book service mainly while visiting the University of Malaya Library Website, or are referred to it by their lecturers, friends or the librarians. About 70% rate positively on the e-book service. Those who are users of e-books find e-books easy to use and their usages are mainly for writing assignment or project work. Most respondents prefer to use e-versions of textbooks and reference sources. Generally, both users and non-users of e-books prefer to use the printed version of textbooks especially if the text is continuously used. There are significant difference between the frequency of e-book use and gender; between past usage of e-book and preference for electronic textbooks and reference books. The possible factors which may be related to e-book use are categorized into 4 groups and presented in a model, which comprises the ICT competencies of the students, their cognitive makeup, the degree of user access to the e-books and the functional or use factors.","Roesnita, Ismail;Zainab, A.

912,"We have developed a (freeware) routine for ""referenced publication years spectroscopy"" (RPYS) and apply this method to the historiography of ""iMetrics,"" that is, the junction of the journals Scientometrics, Informetrics, and the relevant subset of JASIST (approx. 20%) that shapes the intellectual space for the development of information metrics (bibliometrics, scientometrics, informetrics, and webometrics). The application to information metrics (our own field of research) provides us with the opportunity to validate this methodology, and to add a reflection about using citations for the historical reconstruction. The results show that the field is rooted in individual contributions of the 1920s-1950s (e.g., Alfred J. Lotka), and was then shaped intellectually in the early 1960s by a confluence of the history of science (Derek de Solla Price), documentation (e.g., Michael M. Kessler's ""bibliographic coupling""), and ""citation indexing"" (Eugene Garfield). Institutional development at the interfaces between science studies and information science has been reinforced by the new journal Informetrics since 2007. In a concluding reflection, we return to the question of how the historiography of science using algorithmic means--in terms of citation practices--can be different from an intellectual history of the field based, for example, on reading source materials.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Bornmann, Lutz;Marx, Werner;Milojević, Staša",ArXiv e-prints,X0f16867ac;X0fbc5f5cc;X2379c9977;X42fad5d27;X45fdbf55b;X6e14f3ea8;X746bba0fe;X868e11c94;X881a4eb06;X93222a4f7;X96f2e38b3;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xb06aa336d;Xb899a4f01;Xc1cf9caf1;Xdfc36d458;Xe15cc9e63;Xe52daadac;Xf381e4948;Xf6bf186db;Xfa49946f2,22,"Referenced Publication Years Spectroscopy applied to iMetrics: Scientometrics, Journal of Informetrics, and a relevant subset of JASIST",http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5706,2013
913,"It has been suggested that bibliometric analysis of different document types may reveal new aspects of research performance. In medical research a number of study types play different roles in the research process and it has been shown, that the evidence-level of study types is associated with varying citation rates. This study focuses on clinical practice guidelines, which are supposed to gather the highest evidence on a given topic to give the best possible recommendation for practitioners. The quality of clinical practice guidelines, measured using the AGREE score, is compared to the citations given to the references used in these guidelines, as it is hypothesised, that better guidelines are based on higher cited references. AGREE scores are gathered from reviews of clinical practice guidelines on a number of diseases and treatments. Their references are collected from Web of Science and citation counts are normalised using the item-oriented z-score and the PPtop-10% indicators. A positive correlation between both citation indicators and the AGREE score of clinical practice guidelines is found. Some potential confounding factors are identified. While confounding cannot be excluded, results indicate low likelihood for the identified confounders. The results provide a new perspective to and application of citation analysis.","Andersen, Jens Peter",ArXiv e-prints,X07ee741e5;X13b9fb9bf;X9d0cb154c;Xb767275b5;Xc951e17c2;Xe36068f8c,6,Association between quality of clinical practice guidelines and citations given to their references,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5782,2013

915,"User-generated content is shaping the dynamics of the World Wide Web. Indeed, an increasingly large number of systems provide mechanisms to support the growing demand for content creation, sharing, and management. Tagging systems are a particular class of these systems where users share and collaboratively annotate content such as photos and URLs. This collaborative behavior and the pool of user-generated metadata create opportunities to improve existing systems and to design new mechanisms. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to understand the usage characteristics of current systems. This work addresses this issue characterizing three tagging systems (CiteULike, Connotea and del.icio.us) while focusing on three aspects: i) the patterns of information (tags and items) production; ii) the temporal dynamics of users' tag vocabularies; and, iii) the social aspects of tagging systems.","Santos-Neto, Elizeu;Condon, David;Andrade, Nazareno;Iamnitchi, Adriana;Ripeanu, Matei",ArXiv e-prints,X01c335933;X059eec93f;X08366afd6;X0f16c041b;X148cd094a;X197e13ef2;X1b5998f3d;X21a19a5b9;X221cc50ea;X285820a4c;X28fc5b5ae;X37ea3f801;X44c7ebde2;X47c69cc58;X4aaa9a58c;X6d28f4b80;X919f4c8c9;X93943f56b;X9b7dc69c1;Xa51cf96e2;Xb7b920db6;Xc86fe7892;Xce04de949;Xd836f48f8;Xdc40cee4b;Xe4c9cba13;Xf430a29dd;Xfcc5f7b23,28,"Reuse, Temporal Dynamics, Interest Sharing, and Collaboration in Social Tagging Systems",http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6191,2013

918,Fractional scoring has been proposed to avoid inconsistencies in the attribution of publications to percentile rank classes. Uncertainties and ambiguities in the evaluation of percentile ranks can be demonstrated most easily with small datasets. But for larger datasets an often large number of papers with the same citation count leads to the same uncertainties and ambiguities which can be avoided by fractional scoring. This is demonstrated for four different empirical datasets with several thousand publications each which are assigned to 6 percentile rank classes. Only by utilizing fractional scoring the total score of all papers exactly reproduces the theoretical value in each case.,"Schreiber, Michael",ArXiv e-prints,X15aae7314;X23d044406;X56d53edce;X5a3293b91;X7b29faf3b;X94b8e6c1e;Xa445f1180;Xb694d6f1e;Xcfac03818;Xd7a805d89,10,Empirical Evidence for the Relevance of Fractional Scoring in the Calculation of Percentile Rank Scores,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7192,2013
919,"The study of inter-human communication requires a more complex framework than Shannon's (1948) mathematical theory of communication because ""information"" is defined in the latter case as meaningless uncertainty. Assuming that meaning cannot be communicated, we extend Shannon's theory by defining mutual redundancy as a positional counterpart of the relational communication of information. Mutual redundancy indicates the surplus of meanings that can be provided to the exchanges in reflexive communications. The information is redundant because based on ""pure sets,"" that is, without subtraction of mutual information in the overlaps. We show that in the three-dimensional case (e.g., of a Triple Helix of university-industry-government relations), mutual redundancy is equal to mutual information (Rxyz = Txyz); but when the dimensionality is even, the sign is different. We generalize to the measurement in N dimensions and proceed to the interpretation. Using Luhmann's social-systems theory and/or Giddens' structuration theory, mutual redundancy can be provided with an interpretation in the sociological case: different meaning-processing structures code and decode with other algorithms. A surplus of (""absent"") options can then be generated that add to the redundancy. Luhmann's ""functional (sub)systems"" of expectations or Giddens' ""rule-resource sets"" are positioned mutually, but coupled operationally in events or ""instantiated"" in actions. Shannon-type information is generated by the mediation, but the ""structures"" are (re-)positioned towards one another as sets of (potentially counterfactual) expectations. The structural differences among the coding and decoding algorithms provide a source of additional options in reflexive and anticipatory communications.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Ivanova, Inga A.",ArXiv e-prints,X007810752;X071f8691a;X09ac3c650;X0a5aa8eb3;X0c4b9c123;X0c7382c30;X0ce6355e0;X0d309bd12;X0ed876d73;X118dc0eea;X1240c02ef;X1403bd75b;X1785cc0bb;X1f0c76658;X22e3035e3;X2ef8a4546;X31429edfa;X33c999bb5;X3566d494b;X38fead175;X42742c846;X4699c12d2;X4dfc9754f;X53d2e3d1f;X5b0337f20;X5e17323f4;X62f0a5657;X64c2af929;X670d673b0;X673523ba8;X699ee97d8;X6d95a569b;X6f8e68bae;X70c485664;X7399b6af4;X74caa9c6a;X76c7e9f98;X784743056;X7901a2a76;X7e60de0fc;X8b409f409;X8cf733892;X963e26aa9;X9e398f8ce;X9ecf765dc;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa3e89a4e9;Xaa1d49e4c;Xaa8204b1c;Xaab9a836a;Xac1170898;Xad63d9e43;Xad9f07314;Xb1c3f10c4;Xb1e5889f8;Xb50dca348;Xb65036c66;Xbd913c569;Xc08d5798c;Xc3cff12ff;Xc7639707f;Xc7b2e4449;Xc7d0c9032;Xceefd0826;Xd02664d96;Xd2c635d3d;Xd83cd7107;Xd9a3f6684;Xd9e5da07d;Xdb7f859ea;Xdba6e1d72;Xe0ab9dbb4;Xe6acdb16f;Xec0932a46;Xeed62c5a3;Xf0dcc488a;Xf36ef0853;Xf39798318;Xfa15a9646,79,Mutual Redundancies in Inter-human Communication Systems: Steps Towards a Calculus of Processing Meaning,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6849,2013

For instance, the increase in the use of `personalized' toolkits that are becoming an integral part of the online presence for learning organizations, like museums, can provide a basis for creating and sustaining communities. A set of case studies further illustrates working examples of the ways in which personalization and specific tools are developing collaborative spaces, community channels and group interactions.","Beler, Alpay;Borda, Ann;Bowen, Jonathan P.;Filippini-Fantoni, Silvia",ArXiv e-prints,X0d5d26bbd;X19c910d71;X1a487e9e6;X20d99df7d;X20f19cd8d;X24370257c;X25818a50a;X2800eb17c;X29ab89f47;X34b267cf9;X4ab530895;X4e23a7218;X4f8d315c0;X573bdceef;X61db5e94a;X6918941c6;X69cdc8fbe;X6ca3aa63f;X71b760cf8;X7ae8785ef;X8019f7279;X840f1f167;X84ed88251;X85d379ec3;X8c1b2ba5d;X8e8eac2b8;Xa31a2a3fb;Xa39b86dee;Xa469b6be5;Xb91e3341f;Xbb2087831;Xbbcffd57e;Xc7df60c04;Xcb6c2cdfc;Xdb756b87e;Xdd953e759;Xe25f1af81;Xe7a69d8a6;Xfd8f97bee,39,"The Building of Online Communities: An approach for learning organizations, with a particular focus on the museum sector",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0409055,2004
921,"For several decades, a leading paradigm of how to quantitatively assess scientific research has been the analysis of the aggregated citation information in a set of scientific publications. Although the representation of this information as a citation network has already been coined in the 1960s, it needed the systematic indexing of scientific literature to allow for impact metrics that actually made use of this network as a whole improving on the then prevailing metrics that were almost exclusively based on the number of direct citations. However, besides focusing on the assignment of credit, the paper citation network can also be studied in terms of the proliferation of scientific ideas. Here we introduce a simple measure based on the shortest-paths in the paper's in-component or, simply speaking, on the shape and size of the wake of a paper within the citation network. Applied to a citation network containing Physical Review publications from more than a century, our approach is able to detect seminal articles which have introduced concepts of obvious importance to the further development of physics. We observe a large fraction of papers co-authored by Nobel Prize laureates in physics among the top-ranked publications.","Klosik, David F.;Bornholdt, Stefan",PLoS ONE,X10236251d;X639097985;X67570c69e;Xdad6086b8;Xf166bb050,5,The Citation Wake of Publications Detects Nobel Laureates' Papers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7471,2014
922,"The task of expert finding has been getting increasing attention in information retrieval literature. However, the current state-of-the-art is still lacking in principled approaches for combining different sources of evidence in an optimal way. This paper explores the usage of learning to rank methods as a principled approach for combining multiple estimators of expertise, derived from the textual contents, from the graph-structure with the citation patterns for the community of experts, and from profile information about the experts. Experiments made over a dataset of academic publications, for the area of Computer Science, attest for the adequacy of the proposed approaches.","Moreira, Catarina;Calado, Pável;Martins, Bruno",ArXiv e-prints,X0b3e26a84;X134718dc7;X2fa1552eb;X3470c2854;X359ee331f;X381ed79c6;X3e95265e2;X40bc971cf;X575c20b48;X694a99aca;X6c6813064;X7bd0dccd6;X7deee3b87;X8338ddcd7;X83e055dae;X903033e51;X95bdf1a64;Xb2f7cbbdb;Xc30559d02;Xc322230d5;Xcdc6dcb33;Xd63f77588;Xdd0498548;Xe017a8aba;Xe449fd885;Xf5ecc9bd3;Xf6f42222d,27,Learning to Rank for Expert Search in Digital Libraries of Academic Publications,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0413,2013
923,"The increasing use of productivity and impact metrics for evaluation and comparison, not only of individual researchers but also of institutions, universities and even countries, has prompted the development of bibliometrics. Currently, metrics are becoming widely accepted as an easy and balanced way to assist the peer review and evaluation of scientists and/or research units, provided they have adequate precision and recall. This paper presents a benchmarking study of a selected list of representative Portuguese research units, based on a fairly complete set of parameters: bibliometric parameters, number of competitive projects and number of PhDs produced. The study aimed at collecting productivity and impact data from the selected research units in comparable conditions i.e., using objective metrics based on public information, retrievable on-line and/or from official sources and thus verifiable and repeatable. The study has thus focused on the activity of the 2003-06 period, where such data was available from the latest official evaluation. The main advantage of our study was the application of automatic tools, achieving relevant results at a reduced cost. Moreover, the results over the selected units suggest that this kind of analyses will be very useful to benchmark scientific productivity and impact, and assist peer review.","Couto, Francisco M;Faria, Daniel;Tavares, Bruno;Gonçalves, Pedro;Verissimo, Paulo",ArXiv e-prints,X1e78960c0;X55ff57b1c;X790256d25;Xa95b5ff7c;Xc976721c7;Xeb837d64d,6,Benchmarking some Portuguese S&T system research units: 2nd Edition,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0420,2013
924,"This article focuses on the importance of the precise calculation of similarity factors between papers and reviewers for performing a fair and accurate automatic assignment of reviewers to papers. It suggests that papers and reviewers' competences should be described by taxonomy of keywords so that the implied hierarchical structure allows similarity measures to take into account not only the number of exactly matching keywords, but in case of non-matching ones to calculate how semantically close they are. The paper also suggests a similarity measure derived from the well-known and widely-used Dice's coefficient, but adapted in a way it could be also applied between sets whose elements are semantically related to each other (as concepts in taxonomy are). It allows a non-zero similarity factor to be accurately calculated between a paper and a reviewer even if they do not share any keyword in common.","Kalmukov, Yordan",ArXiv e-prints,X1ebd2adcd;X70675e2b5;Xca20dbb99;Xd705a151d,4,Describing Papers and Reviewers' Competences by Taxonomy of Keywords,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6527,2013
925,"This Brief Communication discusses the benefits of citation analysis in research evaluation based on Galton's ""Wisdom of Crowds"" (1907). Citations are based on the assessment of many which is why they can be ascribed a certain amount of accuracy. However, we show that citations are incomplete assessments and that one cannot assume that a high number of citations correlate with a high level of usefulness. Only when one knows that a rarely cited paper has been widely read is it possible to say (strictly speaking) that it was obviously of little use for further research. Using a comparison with 'like' data, we try to determine that cited reference analysis allows a more meaningful analysis of bibliometric data than times-cited analysis.","Bornmann, Lutz;Marx, Werner",ArXiv e-prints,X1a0600b1d;X1eb78e234;X23f3496b6;X26870eed3;X2a637baa4;X3ac3e23db;X3af42dc84;X518b80d01;X53c852023;X8a2975e07;X96df6d5e1;X96f2e38b3;X9be808a14;Xa091cfa5f;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa6bf33243;Xab75c7908;Xcc1260ef1;Xdad6086b8;Xdf5b6863d;Xead073569;Xeef68815a;Xfa16b4b99,24,The Wisdom of Citing Scientists,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1554,2013
926,"In citation networks, the activity of papers usually decreases with age and dormant papers may be discovered and become fashionable again. To model this phenomenon, a competition mechanism is suggested which incorporates two factors: vigorousness and dormancy. Based on this idea, a citation network model is proposed, in which a node has two discrete stage: vigorous and dormant. Vigorous nodes can be deactivated and dormant nodes may be activated and become vigorous. The evolution of the network couples addition of new nodes and state transitions of old ones. Both analytical calculation and numerical simulation show that the degree distribution of nodes in generated networks displays a good right-skewed behavior. Particularly, scale-free networks are obtained as the deactivated vertex is target selected and exponential networks are realized for the random-selected case. Moreover, the measurement of four real-world citation networks achieves a good agreement with the stochastic model.","Wang, Xue-Wen;Zhang, Li-Jie;Yang, Guo-Hong;Xu, Xin-Jian",Modern Physics Letters B,X05b0a2da8;X276c59437;X2c0c74f57;X2c5ae29b4;X388f6d3a4;X6534326e0;X85c285881;X9827d7f9c;X9d1be04b9;Xabd36657e;Xb21410bf4;Xbf7f9a805;Xcb6c2cdfc;Xd35892ec1;Xde656614e;Xe20db6d51;Xfaf3e9121,17,Modeling Citation Networks Based on Vigorousness and Dormancy,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0463,2013
927,"Bibliometric mapping and visualization techniques represent one of the main pillars in the field of scientometrics. Traditionally, the main methodologies employed for representing data are Multi-Dimensional Scaling, Principal Component Analysis or Correspondence Analysis. In this paper we aim at presenting a visualization methodology known as Biplot analysis for representing bibliometric and science and technology indicators. A Biplot is a graphical representation of multivariate data, where the elements of a data matrix are represented according to dots and vectors associated with the rows and columns of the matrix. In this paper we explore the possibilities of applying the Biplot analysis in the research policy area. More specifically we will first describe and introduce the reader to this methodology and secondly, we will analyze its strengths and weaknesses through three different study cases: countries, universities and scientific fields. For this, we use a Biplot analysis known as JK-Biplot. Finally we compare the Biplot representation with other multivariate analysis techniques. We conclude that Biplot analysis could be a useful technique in scientometrics when studying multivariate data and an easy-to-read tool for research decision makers.","Torres-Salinas, Daniel;Robinson-Garcia, Nicolas;Jiménez-Contreras, Evaristo;Herrera, Francisco;Delgado López-Cózar, Emilio",ArXiv e-prints,X00f2581ac;X01820282d;X04a142b01;X04ab1c9de;X05d7256d0;X06b3ef131;X086abf3db;X0a230ac3d;X0cae622c8;X0e7c3ec4f;X0f9b143f5;X10118ce52;X119e69ba3;X1324562f5;X17a526718;X2044ea6b4;X21d9c658e;X23d900d5e;X2444e6324;X279364ad9;X279985123;X29e8ea7bf;X2bd94d227;X2f1ac8e88;X31e16c191;X337f0e532;X34d1caa4e;X35f5bc0da;X370c4ff9f;X382d65659;X38732db68;X3c68a9311;X3ce477cd2;X3d5f09d03;X3e72fe581;X423b5ff99;X4398f3e3a;X442c0f244;X45856ab17;X466dacd8e;X4b3daef5f;X4d8a8749d;X4f4a35d6c;X557910e7e;X57b515994;X58c0b33d3;X590f91e35;X5b485e977;X5b714bda0;X5ceebcf34;X625dc43dc;X640807e8e;X64b509c1a;X68c59b918;X69737d444;X6a53fd09b;X6f053cbfc;X707d1bd30;X73cd36e82;X7677c12a9;X77cdc2b35;X7859c8b73;X8029b6ef7;X820f87d41;X8241b390f;X8961cf57d;X8e0dfd423;X916ccf6dc;X96172f8b2;X97945e7a5;X97c25a0b6;X9cd568dfd;X9d2173b79;X9e5d97a58;X9ecabc9d6;Xa0032f6ae;Xa0a024534;Xa1b994b71;Xa32b99ad5;Xa36095d06;Xa6471d86a;Xa73cf9da6;Xaa0241c47;Xaa8c2b005;Xaea1f7dfb;Xaea46651c;Xaf653b2e5;Xb03ef26bf;Xb563978c5;Xb7fd0ca7e;Xbb21376bc;Xc0fa369a3;Xc2c146665;Xc303cdde8;Xc56da94a1;Xc57bf67cd;Xc6eb57dfb;Xc94946c4f;Xcbc300eae;Xcc1c6d2fc;Xcc634e834;Xd28252096;Xd4e6d2cd7;Xd7efe9cdd;Xd9db113a6;Xe146ffa5e;Xe60e2b611;Xe7ee7e868;Xea8895dea;Xf1aa85625;Xf419d4b4f;Xf5520b240;Xf585d7c9f;Xfb2754a5d;Xfc41c0bc7,115,On the use of Biplot analysis for multivariate bibliometric and scientific indicators,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0608,2013
928,"Discussions of the economics of scholarly communication are usually devoted to Open Access, rising journal prices, publisher profits, and boycotts. That ignores what seems a much more important development in this market. Publishers, through the oft-reviled ""Big Deal"" packages, are providing much greater and more egalitarian access to the journal literature, an approximation to true Open Access. In the process they are also marginalizing libraries, and obtaining a greater share of the resources going into scholarly communication. This is enabling a continuation of publisher profits as well as of what for decades has been called ""unsustainable journal price escalation"". It is also inhibiting the spread of Open Access, and potentially leading to an oligopoly of publishers controlling distribution through large-scale licensing. The ""Big Deal"" practices are worth studying for several general reasons. The degree to which publishers succeed in diminishing the role of libraries may be an indicator of the degree and speed at which universities transform themselves. More importantly, these ""Big Deals"" appear to point the way to the future of the whole economy, where progress is characterized by declining privacy, increasing price discrimination, increasing opaqueness in pricing, increasing reliance on low-paid or upaid work of others for profits, and business models that depend on customer inertia.","Odlyzko, Andrew",ArXiv e-prints,X020c2171c;X087bd5223;X0c1047776;X10486fe56;X15f0c021a;X18586a0a8;X21715a301;X220ffcbb1;X3d55cad37;X3e0ccf8e7;X3f3895728;X4078d519e;X46a5b19ae;X47f0732ca;X4a9ef0ba6;X4c10933fc;X55c8cae9d;X5636c1efa;X594fb2851;X5c3e5db0e;X5dd7afd83;X689391429;X6beef6ad1;X70ebaa43f;X79ac24a16;X7d5b9aead;X7f8af3f4f;X86dc01d62;X88ed94618;X9156f249c;X937a3501e;X974a990a6;X9c792c79e;X9d27e40b4;X9e6bde588;X9ecceb9fa;Xa4a8ac029;Xa6b723a25;Xb810413df;Xbc915ef9d;Xc19a20f07;Xc71ec55ce;Xc9c7fcab4;Xcb8b4991f;Xd016edce6;Xd616d70eb;Xda8ac2676;Xe5269fe1e;Xe77ef0831;Xf1ebbbcb7;Xfe38d5ab7;Xff91539dd,52,"Open Access, library and publisher competition, and the evolution of general commerce",http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1105,2013

This way, it opens new possibilities for measuring journal impacts in the field of Humanities.

In sum, 69 journals were identified, accounting for only 24% of the History journals published in Spain. The ranges of H index values for this field are so small that the ranking can no longer be said to show a discriminating potential. In the light of this, we would like to propose a change in the way Google Scholar Metrics is designed so that it could also accommodate production and citation patterns in the particular field of History, and, in a broader scope, in the area of Humanities as well.","Delgado Lopez-Cozar, Emilio;Ramirez Sanchez, Manuel",ArXiv e-prints,X08ca92fc4;X0970d64d1;X0ca077817;X105b561bd;X118e3d368;X16433110c;X1877f5ed6;X1d454ae6d;X3cafff13e;X5e1102ccf;X60445da33;X6b8049b5e;X6e5a30442;X6eb04c47f;X76916e530;X7824446df;X8173c33ed;X8286959f5;X84d2a4417;X88c6d27a9;X89dd24cd0;Xa48366bc7;Xb2e5c3fd1;Xca877ed47;Xcc57d97fa;Xd9089cf40;Xe23c13a82;Xe5a5d4b0e;Xe9ca4a14c;Xfb7df3cbb,30,H Index of History journals published in Spain according to Google Scholar Metrics (2007-2011),http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1848,2013

As an example we consider the network of citations to scientific papers. Contrary to common belief that its growth is determined by the linear preferential attachment, our microscopic measurements show that it is driven by the nonlinear autocatalytic growth. This invalidates the scale-free hypothesis for the citation network. The nonlinearity is responsible for a dramatic dynamical phase transition: while the citation lifetime of majority of papers is 6-10 years, the highly-cited papers have practically infinite lifetime.","Golosovsky, Michael;Solomon, Sorin",Journal of Statistical Physics,X2177570ef;X3d0492c2d;X6e29272b8;X6e86704b1;X93f88bbc5;X9be820ba9;Xc8e18cbe5;Xd3192f135,8,The Transition Towards Immortality: Non-linear Autocatalytic Growth of Citations to Scientific Papers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2760,2013

From these data we construct five different networks for each year analyzed: (i) the patent co-inventor network, (ii) the publication co-author network, (iii) the co-applicant patent network, (iv) the patent citation network, and (v) the patent mobility network. We use methods from network science and econometrics to perform a comparative analysis across time and between EU and non-EU countries to determine the ""treatment effect"" resulting from EU integration policies. Using non-EU countries as a control set, we provide quantitative evidence that, despite decades of efforts to build a European Research Area, there has been little integration above global trends in patenting and publication. This analysis provides concrete evidence that Europe remains a collection of national innovation systems.","Chessa, A.;Morescalchi, A.;Pammolli, F.;Penner, O.;Petersen, A.

940,"Although bibliometrics has been a separate research field for many years, there is still no uniformity in the way bibliometric analyses are applied to individual researchers. Therefore, this study aims to set up proposals how to evaluate individual researchers working in the natural and life sciences. 2005 saw the introduction of the h index, which gives information about a researcher's productivity and the impact of his or her publications in a single number (h is the number of publications with at least h citations); however, it is not possible to cover the multidimensional complexity of research performance and to undertake inter-personal comparisons with this number. This study therefore includes recommendations for a set of indicators to be used for evaluating researchers. Our proposals relate to the selection of data on which an evaluation is based, the analysis of the data and the presentation of the results.","Bornmann, Lutz;Marx, Werner",ArXiv e-prints,5457dc69d9;X02920bcae;X048640e99;X084fe0a7e;X0a871ec12;X0ef86b2af;X138a366ae;X14167dbce;X1871339d5;X1882ec132;X19620a8fc;X1b428b7a5;X1f334322f;X23b4c11b9;X25db0ffdc;X298712b56;X2b512371d;X2b70e1bf4;X2c0460254;X2d9ae436a;X2ed14795d;X311e7510a;X353f09711;X367d0cda0;X36cc17d8d;X379d8cd8f;X3b110c118;X3cd2b8939;X3ebb18fd8;X3ed13f111;X3f0d79642;X41fa1b10b;X41fce75a7;X428fe187b;X4a2d47537;X4ce677b5f;X4fb14ff1c;X50aeb0a1c;X55a140cc8;X5771b142c;X60bf51e2c;X60ee5d525;X6142be431;X65384820f;X67349376d;X6a2ba74cd;X6d7474176;X6d7d528bc;X6f992e0f0;X6fa1fac83;X7018422d6;X7508b80d9;X7876ce3b7;X79209a26c;X7b290f4ef;X7b6bb6e8d;X7cb8dfebf;X7dbf652b9;X7e01e9aaa;X7e1d92b99;X7e33aaa52;X7eb6799e4;X7f15ba786;X84db1177a;X8a7b96eb2;X8b5a49f27;X8bd91fe4b;X8e9cae5bc;X90441d17b;X91e2c1bf5;X9471c110f;X9508a2afd;X9675423d5;X97d5f73ef;X987efd23c;X9ac3c6ae0;X9ba2e057e;X9d7a515e3;X9ebe112cc;Xa1aea7927;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa6bf33243;Xa73cfacba;Xa776e0d27;Xa87dd89b9;Xaa01f04c0;Xad54988f0;Xaf0457913;Xb055d0002;Xb37b8e56e;Xb3af8a65b;Xb6b31ee28;Xb8b3ec1d6;Xbfa4d49c5;Xc0e68f6f3;Xc12dfca3f;Xc3d5427fb;Xc61ba9545;Xc6bbea1ca;Xc72e4aa88;Xc8157ba80;Xcb18bcc7e;Xcfac03818;Xd4046e8c5;Xd7a805d89;Xd8369ba55;Xd90baf371;Xdbd774738;Xdccb78f98;Xdcf416fae;Xdea5937a6;Xdeefe7dab;Xe4872020b;Xec1d6f7d7;Xf1e23b3e4;Xf33f5acab;Xf3792d453;Xf5bce0542;Xf5f893cb4;Xf62fc47ed;Xf6aaac642;Xf75c84e7e;Xfb1659e55;Xfe75e8dca;Xfe92186e4;Xfec461ebe;Xff729ca2e,128,How to evaluate individual researchers working in the natural and life sciences meaningfully?

941,"We introduce a novel methodology for mapping academic institutions based on their journal publication profiles. We believe that journals in which researchers from academic institutions publish their works can be considered as useful identifiers for representing the relationships between these institutions and establishing comparisons. However, when academic journals are used for research output representation, distinctions must be introduced between them, based on their value as institution descriptors. This leads us to the use of journal weights attached to the institution identifiers. Since a journal in which researchers from a large proportion of institutions published their papers may be a bad indicator of similarity between two academic institutions, it seems reasonable to weight it in accordance with how frequently researchers from different institutions published their papers in this journal. Cluster analysis can then be applied to group the academic institutions, and dendrograms can be provided to illustrate groups of institutions following agglomerative hierarchical clustering. In order to test this methodology, we use a sample of Spanish universities as a case study. We first map the study sample according to an institution's overall research output, then we use it for two scientific fields (Information and Communication Technologies, as well as Medicine and Pharmacology) as a means to demonstrate how our methodology can be applied, not only for analyzing institutions as a whole, but also in different disciplinary contexts.","García, J.

942,"Various factors are believed to govern the selection of references in citation networks, but a precise, quantitative determination of their importance has remained elusive. In this paper, we show that three factors can account for the referencing pattern of citation networks for two topics, namely ""graphenes"" and ""complex networks"", thus allowing one to reproduce the topological features of the networks built with papers being the nodes and the edges established by citations. The most relevant factor was content similarity, while the other two - in-degree (i.e. citation counts) and {age of publication} had varying importance depending on the topic studied. This dependence indicates that additional factors could play a role. Indeed, by intuition one should expect the reputation (or visibility) of authors and/or institutions to affect the referencing pattern, and this is only indirectly considered via the in-degree that should correlate with such reputation. Because information on reputation is not readily available, we simulated its effect on artificial citation networks considering two communities with distinct fitness (visibility) parameters. One community was assumed to have twice the fitness value of the other, which amounts to a double probability for a paper being cited. While the h-index for authors in the community with larger fitness evolved with time with slightly higher values than for the control network (no fitness considered), a drastic effect was noted for the community with smaller fitness.","Amancio, Diego R.;Oliveira, Osvaldo N., Jr.;Costa, Luciano da F.",ArXiv e-prints,X4390dead2;X4be51bc13;X667f2f304;X7f17a2f67;Xcfdc45122;Xdad6086b8;Xe6f17e2d5;Xfb984bcdc,8,Three-feature model to reproduce the topology of citation networks and the effects from authors' visibility on their h-index,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4095,2013
943,"Citation networks have fed numerous works in scientific evaluation, science mapping (and more recently large-scale network studies) for decades. The variety of citation behavior across scientific fields is both a research topic in sociology of science, and a problem in scientific evaluation. Normalization, tantamount to a particular weighting of links in the citation network, is necessary for allowing across-field comparisons of citation scores and interdisciplinary studies. In addition to classical normalization which drastically reduces all variability factors altogether, two tracks of research have emerged in the recent years. One is the revival of iterative ""influence measures"". The second is the ""citing-side"" normalization, whose only purpose is to control for the main factor of variability, the inequality in citing propensity, letting other aspects play: knowledge export/imports and growth. When all variables are defined at the same field-level, two propositions are established: (a) the gross impact measure identifies with the product of relative growth rate, gross balance of citation exchanges, and relative number of references (b) the normalized impact identifies with the product of relative growth rate and normalized balance. At the science level, the variance of growth rate over domains is a proxy for change in the system, and the variance of balance a measure of inter-disciplinary dependences. This opens a new perspective, where the resulting variance of normalized impact, and a related measure, the sum of these variances proposed as a Change-Exchange Indicator, summarize important aspects of science structure and dynamism. Results based on a decade's data are discussed. The behavior of normalized impact according to scale changes is also briefly discussed.","Zitt, Michel;Cointet, Jean-Philippe",ArXiv e-prints,54f8a3a714;5519715d4c;5526c53f20;X1306f43fe;X17aa5992f;X254296f82;X2701b3216;X2b937396e;X2e7c4ce98;X31bd8003d;X3dc589d91;X43dca4178;X441105907;X4634ca971;X557d8b8d0;X5585f6493;X59437fbf0;X64344bb9b;X670392cb7;X7dcf39de1;X835dd36c8;X9ddb45e1a;Xa1b994b71;Xa707ceabb;Xa7fad295a;Xae6abbf20;Xb6f421a6c;Xc89c3ce36;Xd1817f779;Xdad6086b8;Xdbcadb2a6;Xe1e5aca1c;Xe4823fd21;Xe5bc7131b;Xeda1f3a0a;Xf7293fe32;Xfd6af9e9b,37,Citation impacts revisited: how novel impact measures reflect interdisciplinarity and structural change at the local and global level,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4384,2013
944,"Many features of complex systems can now be unveiled by applying statistical physics methods to treat them as social networks. The power of the analysis may be limited, however, by the presence of ambiguity in names, e.g., caused by homonymy in collaborative networks. In this paper we show that the ability to distinguish between homonymous authors is enhanced when longer-distance connections are considered, rather than looking at only the immediate neighbors of a node in the collaborative network. Optimized results were obtained upon using the 3rd hierarchy in connections. Furthermore, reasonable distinction among authors could also be achieved upon using pattern recognition strategies for the data generated from the topology of the collaborative network. These results were obtained with a network from papers in the arXiv repository, into which homonymy was deliberately introduced to test the methods with a controlled, reliable dataset. In all cases, several methods of supervised and unsupervised machine learning were used, leading to the same overall results. The suitability of using deeper hierarchies and network topology was confirmed with a real database of movie actors, with the additional finding that the distinguishing ability can be further enhanced by combining topology features and long-range connections in the collaborative network.","Amancio, Diego R.;Oliveira, Osvaldo N., Jr.;Costa, Luciano da F.",EPL (Europhysics Letters),X3232c2ed2;Xca21785a7;Xca719cf0a,3,On the use of topological features and hierarchical characterization for disambiguating names in collaborative networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4504,2012

Recent discoveries regarding its internal dynamics allow the inversion of published ARWU indicator scores to reconstruct raw scores for five hundred world class universities. This paper explores raw scores in the ARWU and in other contests to contrast the dynamics of rank-driven and score-driven tables, and to explain why the ARWU ranking is a score-driven procedure. We show that the ARWU indicators constitute sub-scales of a single factor accounting for research performance, and provide an account of the system of gains and non-linearities used by ARWU. The paper discusses the non-linearities selected by ARWU, concluding that they are designed to represent the regressive character of indicators measuring research performance.

For instance, we can compute the probability of occurrence of book chapters with a number of citations in different intervals for each academic publisher. We predict the similarity between two citation histograms based on the amount of relative information between such characterizations. We observe that the citation patterns of book chapters follow a Lotkaian distribution. This paper describes the structure of the Book Citation Index using 'heliocentric clockwise maps' which allow the reader not only to determine the grade of similarity of a given academic publisher indexed in the Book Citation Index with a specific discipline according to their citation distribution, but also to easily observe the general structure of a discipline, identifying the publishers with higher impact and output.","Torres-Salinas, Daniel;Rodriguez-Sánchez, Rosa;Robinson-Garcia, Nicolas;Fdez-Valdivia, J.;García, J.

However, there exists an ambiguity in the computation of percentiles because usually a significant number of papers with the same citation count are found at the border between percentile rank classes. The present case study of the citations to the journal Europhysics Letters (EPL) in comparison with all physics papers from the Web of Science shows the deviations which occur due to the different ways of treating the tied papers in the evaluation of the percentage of highly cited publications.

954,"The definition of the g-index is as arbitrary as that of the h-index, because the threshold number g^2 of citations to the g most cited papers can be modified by a prefactor at one's discretion, thus taking into account more or less of the highly cited publications within a dataset. In a case study I investigate the citation records of 26 physicists and show that the prefactor influences the ranking in terms of the generalized g-index less than for the generalized h-index. I propose specifically a prefactor of 2 for the g-index, because then the resulting values are of the same order of magnitude as for the common h-index. In this way one can avoid the disadvantage of the original g-index, namely that the values are usually substantially larger than for the h-index and thus the precision problem is substantially larger; while the advantages of the g-index over the h-index are kept. Like for the generalized h-index, also for the generalized g-index different prefactors might be more useful for investigations which concentrate only on top scientists with high citation frequencies or on junior researchers with small numbers of citations.","Schreiber, Michael",ArXiv e-prints,X0c71be14c;X1915935e2;X76524f44c;X8d4dc3b70;X94dd7e54e;Xa81d51cdd;Xb2f9896e7;Xc95ab4b40;Xe86d577d0,9,How to derive an advantage from the arbitrariness of the g-index,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6396,2013

Likewise, the arbitrariness of the highly-cited-publications indicator is due to the threshold value, given either as an absolute number of citations or as a percentage of highly cited papers.

In this paper, we have proposed a medial axis based thinning strategy used for performing skeletonization of printed and handwritten character images. In this method, we have used shape characteristics of text to get skeleton of nearly same as the true character shape. This approach helps to preserve the local features and true shape of the character images. The proposed algorithm produces one pixel width thin skeleton. As a by-product of our thinning approach, the skeleton also gets segmented into strokes in vector form. Hence further stroke segmentation is not required. Experiment is done on printed English and Bengali characters and we obtain less spurious branches comparing with other thinning methods without any post processing.","Bag, Soumen;Harit, Gaurav",ArXiv e-prints,5547c85f9a;X07c4ec776;X119683aca;X25e087200;X44bb3bab9;X5a7fb06ac;X5de4bdb61;X5fe4a792a;X71cffc06d;X7e0fd30ad;X89ddabb1f;X921b3de4f;X93be1ad18;X9e676cd20;Xa8f0fddc1;Xb385f695f;Xc55bb1696;Xc9117f3e6;Xd34b80eca;Xe87093df9;Xf37f3b68b,21,A Medial Axis Based Thinning Strategy for Character Images,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0738,2011

961,"What factors affect a scientist's choice of research problem? Qualitative research in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science suggests that this choice is shaped by an ""essential tension"" between the professional demand for productivity and a conflicting drive toward risky innovation. We examine this tension empirically in the context of biomedical chemistry. We use complex networks to represent the evolving state of scientific knowledge, as expressed in publications. We then define research strategies relative to these networks. Scientists can introduce novel chemicals or chemical relationships--or delve deeper into known ones. They can consolidate existing knowledge clusters, or bridge distant ones. Analyzing such choices in aggregate, we find that the distribution of strategies remains remarkably stable, even as chemical knowledge grows dramatically. High-risk strategies, which explore new chemical relationships, are less prevalent in the literature, reflecting a growing focus on established knowledge at the expense of new opportunities. Research following a risky strategy is more likely to be ignored but also more likely to achieve high impact and recognition. While the outcome of a risky strategy has a higher expected reward than the outcome of a conservative strategy, the additional reward is insufficient to compensate for the additional risk. By studying the winners of 137 different prizes in biomedicine and chemistry, we show that the occasional ""gamble"" for extraordinary impact is the most plausible explanation for observed levels of risk-taking. Our empirical demonstration and unpacking of the ""essential tension"" suggests policy interventions that may foster more innovative research.","Foster, Jacob G.;Rzhetsky, Andrey;Evans, James A.",ArXiv e-prints,X052840596;X0b559beb5;X15945b855;X20e20e8d0;X238aaa3df;X26705b243;X26b2f773d;X30a204203;X35567ba20;X3bd616a0d;X406b49eaa;X509e97ab2;X5a04023e5;X5b0e63210;X6071b92be;X6f053cbfc;X6fdd9a8fe;X755935d6a;X7c3db9c64;X807685310;X930fdd990;X98ee84b59;Xa2eb606a5;Xb244c7803;Xb3d56bf3d;Xc13331a39;Xc4b73eef0;Xc74a4e6c3;Xcc4723a58;Xcfac03818;Xd7a805d89;Xe8cb85b87,32,Tradition and Innovation in Scientists' Research Strategies,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6906,2013

Yet, most of these measures focus on productivity, thus fostering the ``publish or perish'' paradigm. This article proposes a measure that aims at quantifying the impact of research de-emphasizing productivity, thus providing scientists an alternative, conceivably fairer, evaluation of their work. The measure builds from a published manuscript, the literature's most basic building block. The impact of an article is defined as the number of lead authors that have been influenced by it. Thus, the measure aims at quantifying the manuscript's reach, putting emphasis on scientists rather than on raw citations.

968,"In this paper, we present an approach for extending the existing concept of nanopublications --- tiny entities of scientific results in RDF representation --- to broaden their application range. The proposed extension uses English sentences to represent informal and underspecified scientific claims. These sentences follow a syntactic and semantic scheme that we call AIDA (Atomic, Independent, Declarative, Absolute), which provides a uniform and succinct representation of scientific assertions. Such AIDA nanopublications are compatible with the existing nanopublication concept and enjoy most of its advantages such as information sharing, interlinking of scientific findings, and detailed attribution, while being more flexible and applicable to a much wider range of scientific results. We show that users are able to create AIDA sentences for given scientific results quickly and at high quality, and that it is feasible to automatically extract and interlink AIDA nanopublications from existing unstructured data sources. To demonstrate our approach, a web-based interface is introduced, which also exemplifies the use of nanopublications for non-scientific content, including meta-nanopublications that describe other nanopublications.","Kuhn, Tobias;Emilio Barbano, Paolo;Levente Nagy, Mate;Krauthammer, Michael",ArXiv e-prints,X0d1ec5159;X2c3c11497;X4978eed88;X5b0bd5413;X5e908a447;X64fa8a868;X848c1ed46;X86282e42b;X8cfd58874;X9e02d3a20;X9e84f7295;Xbc440eb94;Xbd41a1483;Xc337aa09c;Xc6c4648d4;Xd506da74b;Xd8410e348;Xe08a489bd;Xef28c3a14,19,Broadening the Scope of Nanopublications,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2446,2013
969,"Background: The web has become a primary information resource about illnesses and treatments for both medical and non-medical users. Standard web search is by far the most common interface for such information. It is therefore of interest to find out how well web search engines work for diagnostic queries and what factors contribute to successes and failures. Among diseases, rare (or orphan) diseases represent an especially challenging and thus interesting class to diagnose as each is rare, diverse in symptoms and usually has scattered resources associated with it. Methods: We use an evaluation approach for web search engines for rare disease diagnosis which includes 56 real life diagnostic cases, state-of-the-art evaluation measures, and curated information resources. In addition, we introduce FindZebra, a specialized (vertical) rare disease search engine. FindZebra is powered by open source search technology and uses curated freely available online medical information. Results: FindZebra outperforms Google Search in both default setup and customised to the resources used by FindZebra. We extend FindZebra with specialized functionalities exploiting medical ontological information and UMLS medical concepts to demonstrate different ways of displaying the retrieved results to medical experts. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a specialized search engine can improve the diagnostic quality without compromising the ease of use of the currently widely popular web search engines. The proposed evaluation approach can be valuable for future development and benchmarking.

970,"We investigate the problem of counting co-authorhip in order to quantify the impact and relevance of scientific research output through normalized \textit{h-index} and \textit{g-index}. We use the papers whose authors belong to a subset of full professors of the Italian Settore Scientifico Disciplinare (SSD) FIS01 - Experimental Physics. In this SSD two populations, characterized by the number of co-authors of each paper, are roughly present. The total number of citations for each individuals, as well as their h-index and g-index, strongly depends on the average number of co-authors. We show that, in order to remove the dependence of the various indices on the two populations, the best way to define a fractional counting of autorship is to divide the number of citations received by each paper by the square root of the number of co-authors. This allows us to obtain some information which can be used for a better understanding of the scientific knowledge made through the process of writing and publishing papers.","Carbone, Vincenzo",ArXiv e-prints,X1e1923cba;X2b7342c13;X35a6edf1c;X45aff41dc;X5c3e5db0e;X64e170c88;X659799cf4;X6e5ab6ef7;X6eb073649;X756a55dd4;X83b611785;X8e8b9ca41;X92de81c50;Xab01a1fa1;Xc5b9b8e10;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xceb8ba4fc;Xd85750066;Xe1984595c;Xe8e21ca4f;Xed1f8c93a;Xff1673af9,22,Fractional counting of authorship to quantify scientific research output,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0114,2011
971,"F1000 is a post-publication peer review service for biological and medical research. F1000 aims to recommend important publications in the biomedical literature, and from this perspective F1000 could be an interesting tool for research evaluation. By linking the complete database of F1000 recommendations to the Web of Science bibliographic database, we are able to make a comprehensive comparison between F1000 recommendations and citations. We find that about 2% of the publications in the biomedical literature receive at least one F1000 recommendation. Recommended publications on average receive 1.30 recommendations, and over 90% of the recommendations are given within half a year after a publication has appeared. There turns out to be a clear correlation between F1000 recommendations and citations. However, the correlation is relatively weak, at least weaker than the correlation between journal impact and citations. More research is needed to identify the main reasons for differences between recommendations and citations in assessing the impact of publications.","Waltman, Ludo;Costas, Rodrigo",ArXiv e-prints,X00dd561cf;X028545815;X03ab63edf;X07c20c0b2;X0954e8445;X0b28bb6cb;X0ea60682f;X140b86281;X1e6b91121;X2abb24e41;X2baf55aeb;X2f615d818;X31f930052;X3488a9dda;X3da6d53b9;X45978c3c3;X4b72ecbe0;X4c1b6d5d2;X527d043c7;X54dbaa628;X58560aba1;X5d2f1264f;X60cd1d085;X61750719c;X6974142b8;X78dca00ea;X8035b3b11;X8249adb30;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X8aa2ff375;X8f5fc3da6;X9156758d1;X971c5f21f;X98693e27c;X9a243569e;X9bc2e85d9;Xa1b994b71;Xb1875d7bd;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xc4d8f5c8c;Xc79421f0d;Xcc42536d6;Xd011d9c1b;Xd8fc69d4c;Xda7b026af;Xe45da9a65;Xe4e0d031c;Xea0c1a83b;Xf129f2820;Xf3b223276;Xf6303ef83;Xf8046f226;Xf907854c7,55,F1000 recommendations as a new data source for research evaluation: A comparison with citations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3875,2013
972,"Group-based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) is applied to the citation curves of articles in six journals and to all citable items in a single field of science (Virology, 24 journals), in order to distinguish among the developmental trajectories in subpopulations. Can highly-cited citation patterns be distinguished in an early phase as ""fast-breaking"" papers? Can ""late bloomers"" or ""sleeping beauties"" be identified? Most interesting, we find differences between ""sticky knowledge claims"" that continue to be cited more than ten years after publication, and ""transient knowledge claims"" that show a decay pattern after reaching a peak within a few years. Only papers following the trajectory of a ""sticky knowledge claim"" can be expected to have a sustained impact. These findings raise questions about indicators of ""excellence"" that use aggregated citation rates after two or three years (e.g., impact factors). Because aggregated citation curves can also be composites of the two patterns, 5th-order polynomials (with four bending points) are needed to capture citation curves precisely. For the journals under study, the most frequently cited groups were furthermore much smaller than ten percent. Although GBTM has proved a useful method for investigating differences among citation trajectories, the methodology does not enable us to define a percentage of highly-cited papers inductively across different fields and journals. Using multinomial logistic regression, we conclude that predictor variables such as journal names, number of authors, etc., do not affect the stickiness of knowledge claims in terms of citations, but only the levels of aggregated citations (that are field-specific).","Baumgartner, Susanne;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X0293b7fa3;X0b559beb5;X0c6f6b304;X0f7c48a0e;X116f13a5f;X13ea1d266;X174c0b68b;X187bc151f;X1e31bfe92;X1e9a3d8a5;X26bc8fa17;X270ec68e4;X2baf55aeb;X315171896;X33c7e7b80;X3475a0dbd;X367d0cda0;X3c485fe7e;X3dbf2def6;X3e1b7a0bc;X3ed3e62b5;X3fcbd0790;X448eccd2d;X4bc55998a;X4e0d581a7;X53a65d0c8;X57d631eef;X5b85ab212;X5dd7afd83;X69ce7c311;X6bebea043;X6e2d34f98;X704470493;X7142c287f;X76f430c09;X79568e870;X7c10538ec;X7c39f40bf;X7c973e4c6;X7cf923371;X8017031c8;X809cf506a;X80d4c7fd8;X81bc781cf;X844ab0e5a;X8aa132277;X8df0fe457;X901a78142;X94046f087;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa9cdbbfc1;Xbe43e819e;Xc1a17065c;Xc3998b289;Xc6b342262;Xc8e5b1463;Xcf50a8ec1;Xd0ed5d88c;Xd6654b05c;Xdcb07687c;Xe1ce62248;Xe37c103d6;Xe3f38df0d;Xe505c4e0e;Xe758fae5b;Xeaa425958;Xeaf906334;Xf33d97589;Xf65cbd37d;Xf8a3388b5;Xf9a17e9a8;Xfc51ff491,72,"Group-Based Trajectory Modeling of Citations in Scholarly Literature: Dynamic Qualities of ""Transient"" and ""Sticky Knowledge Claims""",http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4366,2013
973,"The design of the defenses Internet systems can deploy against attack, especially adaptive and resilient defenses, must start from a realistic model of the threat. This requires an assessment of the capabilities of the adversary. The design typically evolves through a process of simulating both the system and the adversary. This requires the design and implementation of a simulated adversary based on the capability assessment. Consensus on the capabilities of a suitable adversary is not evident. Part of the recent redesign of the protocol used by peers in the LOCKSS digital preservation system included a conservative assessment of the adversary's capabilities. We present our assessment and the implications we drew from it as a step towards a reusable adversary specification.","Rosenthal, David S. H.;Maniatis, Petros;Roussopoulos, Mema;Giuli, T.

975,"This paper aims to provide evidence on how a set of recently developed scientometric techniques, namely overlay mapping, can function as a tool of 'strategic intelligence' to aid the governance of emerging technologies. We examine the potential these techniques have to inform, in a timely manner, analysts and decision-makers about relevant dynamics of technological emergence across three spaces: geographical, social, and cognitive. Our analysis relies on three case-studies of emerging technologies in the biomedical domain: RNA interference (RNAi), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing technologies for cervical cancer, and Thiopurine Methyltransferase (TPMT) genetic testing. The case-studies are analysed and mapped longitudinally by using publication and patent data. Results illustrate the variety of 'intelligence' inputs overlay mapping can produce for the governance of emerging technologies and the flexibility and granularity - in terms of adaptability to different sources of data and selection of the levels of the analysis, respectively - these approaches confer to the investigation of emergence. These features also enable analysts and decision-makers to integrate and compare results from different contexts and cases, thus potentially functioning as platform for a 'distributed' strategic intelligence.","Rotolo, Daniele;Rafols, Ismael;Hopkins, Michael;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X0245231be;X051177f2d;X12da4409e;X14224f910;X2260f352b;X2535b7e04;X2f07876c2;X39dfe0f6d;X3d15c1921;X46be42b82;X55458f9c9;X55bc8404e;X589fda3ef;X5fcfaaa43;X7064e7b52;X7a13ef509;X808dd0fc1;X8426ae536;X866bf89f1;X883e33239;X8b42f29d8;X8b6157898;X96f2e38b3;X97da6a7fd;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa38368b14;Xacebc6c03;Xb207c6ed4;Xc069f6bff;Xc45a90107;Xde78a81cf;Xe5956d6e5;Xedea993fa,34,Scientometric Mapping as a Strategic Intelligence Tool for the Governance of Emerging Technologies,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4672,2013

This indicates that scientists generally do follow hot topics.

A common pattern in many man-made data sets is Lotka's Law which follows the well-known power-law distributions. These informetric distributions can be used to give an alternative order to large and scattered result sets and can be applied as a new ranking mechanism. The polyrepresentation of information in Digital Library systems is used to enhance the retrieval quality, to overcome the drawbacks of the typical term-based ranking approaches and to enable users to explore retrieved document sets from a different perspective.","Schaer, Philipp",ArXiv e-prints,55467543d7;X00c784b86;X16fe60989;X18bff2d9d;X18ccfaca8;X2ba29801e;X5715ba584;X5a72e6a96;X5c3e5db0e;X5f5c2bd74;X6d704205d;X76349e296;X854b3e855;X9c46fdb05;Xc369f5355;Xf37f3b68b,16,Using Lotkaian Informetrics for Ranking in Digital Libraries,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0217,2011

983,"There are two principal data sources for collaborative filtering recommenders in scholarly digital libraries: usage data obtained from harvesting a large, distributed collection of Open URL web logs and citation data obtained from the journal articles. This study explores the characteristics of recommendations generated by implementations of these two methods: the 'bX' system by ExLibris and an experimental citation-based recommender, Sarkanto. Recommendations from each system were compared according to their semantic similarity to the seed article that was used to generate them. Since the full text of the articles was not available for all the recommendations in both systems, the semantic similarity between the seed article and the recommended articles was deemed to be the semantic distance between the journals in which the articles were published. The semantic distance between journals was computed from the ""semantic vectors"" distance between all the terms in the full-text of the available articles in that journal and this study shows that citation-based recommendations are more semantically diverse than usage-based ones. These recommenders are complementary since most of the time, when one recommender produces recommendations the other does not.","Vellino, André",ArXiv e-prints,X2d5ac6208;X2f2a57694;X3899eeab2;X5b1a5e92f;X87a23018f;X899b6d40a;Xa36076c3d,7,Usage-based vs. Citation-based Methods for Recommending Scholarly Research Articles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7149,2013
984,"Reputation is an important social construct in science, which enables informed quality assessments of both publications and careers of scientists in the absence of complete systemic information. However, the relation between reputation and career growth of an individual remains poorly understood, despite recent proliferation of quantitative research evaluation methods. Here we develop an original framework for measuring how a publication's citation rate $\Delta c$ depends on the reputation of its central author $i$, in addition to its net citation count $c$. To estimate the strength of the reputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450 highly-cited scientists, using the total citations $C_{i}$ of each scientist as his/her reputation measure. We find a citation crossover $c_{\times}$ which distinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications with $c 〈 c_{\times}$, the author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation rate. Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage corresponding to roughly a 66% increase in the citation rate for each tenfold increase in $C_{i}$. However, the reputation effect becomes negligible for highly cited publications meaning that for $c\geq c_{\times}$ the citation rate measures scientific impact more transparently. In addition we have developed a stochastic reputation model, which is found to reproduce numerous statistical observations for real careers, thus providing insight into the microscopic mechanisms underlying cumulative advantage in science.","Petersen, A.

We analyze these networks to gain insight into temporal changes in citation and collaboration over the long time period of the data, as well as correlations and interactions between the two. Among other things, we investigate the change over time in the number of publishing authors, the number of papers they publish, and the number of others with whom they collaborate, changes in the typical number of citations made and received, the extent to which individuals tend to cite themselves or their collaborators more than others, the extent to which they cite themselves or their collaborators more quickly after publication, and the extent to which they tend to return the favor of a citation from another scientist.","Martin, Travis;Ball, Brian;Karrer, Brian;Newman, M.

987,"We stress-test the career predictability model proposed by Acuna et al. [Nature 489, 201-202 2012] by applying their model to a longitudinal career data set of 100 Assistant professors in physics, two from each of the top 50 physics departments in the US. The Acuna model claims to predict h(t+\Delta t), a scientist's h-index \Delta t years into the future, using a linear combination of 5 cumulative career measures taken at career age t. Here we investigate how the ""predictability"" depends on the aggregation of career data across multiple age cohorts. We confirm that the Acuna model does a respectable job of predicting h(t+\Delta t) up to roughly 6 years into the future when aggregating all age cohorts together. However, when calculated using subsets of specific age cohorts (e.g. using data for only t=3), we find that the model's predictive power significantly decreases, especially when applied to early career years. For young careers, the model does a much worse job of predicting future impact, and hence, exposes a serious limitation. The limitation is particularly concerning as early career decisions make up a significant portion, if not the majority, of cases where quantitative approaches are likely to be applied.","Penner, Orion;Petersen, Alexander M.;Pan, Raj K.;Fortunato, Santo",Physics Today,509ac2f300;54f898e9be;5526c611ec;X0211307f1;X04714dfbc;X19c910d71;X25ac71852;X2b44de0a8;X308588523;X33d398d0b;X53742f084;X5a04023e5;X63a1fd37e;X760883c51;X7f95bf70d;X892302c4d;X996930ed3;X9c2454dfb;Xb0440a6cc;Xcc5620271;Xdad6086b8;Xe94ecc02d;Xf788c47f9;Xfed8a62f3,24,Commentary: The case for caution in predicting scientists' future impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0627,2013

990,"Public agencies like the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) award tens of billions of dollars in annual science funding. How can this money be distributed as efficiently as possible to best promote scientific innovation and productivity? The present system relies primarily on peer review of project proposals. In 2010 alone, NSF convened more than 15,000 scientists to review 55,542 proposals. Although considered the scientific gold standard, peer review requires significant overhead costs, and may be subject to biases, inconsistencies, and oversights. We investigate a class of funding models in which all participants receive an equal portion of yearly funding, but are then required to anonymously donate a fraction of their funding to peers. The funding thus flows from one participant to the next, each acting as if he or she were a funding agency themselves. Here we show through a simulation conducted over large-scale citation data (37M articles, 770M citations) that such a distributed system for science may yield funding patterns similar to existing NIH and NSF distributions, but may do so at much lower overhead while exhibiting a range of other desirable features. Self-correcting mechanisms in scientific peer evaluation can yield an efficient and fair distribution of funding. The proposed model can be applied in many situations in which top-down or bottom-up allocation of public resources is either impractical or undesirable, e.g. public investments, distribution chains, and shared resource management.","Bollen, Johan;Crandall, David;Junk, Damion;Ding, Ying;Boerner, Katy",ArXiv e-prints,X0357f9431;X18d8fbf1f;X1b7bc4dfa;X1fe4c85c2;X3a0b664b9;X41b9064b8;X49000e29d;X534d4e851;X579f04b26;X5dcee7c04;X5ee1b4b54;X7188a8017;X733e44103;X73e9ad2b0;X7b2c65c73;X887e34cc1;X90c307b28;X9a6bfde52;X9f4843c57;Xa1b994b71;Xcd6c2930d;Xdf54afe8f;Xe1d034a5a,23,Collective allocation of science funding: from funding agencies to scientific agency,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1067,2013
991,"Citation numbers and other quantities derived from bibliographic databases are becoming standard tools for the assessment of productivity and impact of research activities. Though widely used, still their statistical properties have not been well established so far. This is especially true in the case of bibliometric indicators aimed at the evaluation of individual scholars, because large-scale data sets are typically difficult to be retrieved. Here, we take advantage of a recently introduced large bibliographic data set, Google Scholar Citations, which collects the entire publication record of individual scholars. We analyze the scientific profile of more than 30,000 researchers, and study the relation between the h-index, the number of publications and the number of citations of individual scientists. While the number of publications of a scientist has a rather weak relation with his/her h-index, we find that the h-index of a scientist is strongly correlated with the number of citations that she/he has received so that the number of citations can be effectively be used as a proxy of the h-index. Allowing for the h-index to depend on both the number of citations and the number of publications, we find only a minor improvement.","Radicchi, Filippo;Castellano, Claudio",ArXiv e-prints,X1e0d476e1;X36c765d4f;X5a04023e5;X76b2432b3;X78a75b7c1;X865b8bc21;X87a23018f;X92fbbc550;Xa1b994b71;Xb60e330fe;Xb6b31ee28;Xb715acca4;Xdad6086b8;Xdeefe7dab;Xf381e4948;Xfa1c07a14,16,Analysis of bibliometric indicators for individual scholars in a large data set,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1267,2013
992,"The digitization of scanned forms and documents is changing the data sources that enterprises manage. To integrate these new data sources with enterprise data, the current state-of-the-art approach is to convert the images to ASCII text using optical character recognition (OCR) software and then to store the resulting ASCII text in a relational database. The OCR problem is challenging, and so the output of OCR often contains errors. In turn, queries on the output of OCR may fail to retrieve relevant answers. State-of-the-art OCR programs, e.g., the OCR powering Google Books, use a probabilistic model that captures many alternatives during the OCR process. Only when the results of OCR are stored in the database, do these approaches discard the uncertainty. In this work, we propose to retain the probabilistic models produced by OCR process in a relational database management system. A key technical challenge is that the probabilistic data produced by OCR software is very large (a single book blows up to 2GB from 400kB as ASCII). As a result, a baseline solution that integrates these models with an RDBMS is over 1000x slower versus standard text processing for single table select-project queries. However, many applications may have quality-performance needs that are in between these two extremes of ASCII and the complete model output by the OCR software. Thus, we propose a novel approximation scheme called Staccato that allows a user to trade recall for query performance. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis of our scheme's properties, and describe how we integrate our scheme with standard-RDBMS text indexing.","Kumar, Arun;Ré, Christopher",ArXiv e-prints,X087bd5223;X14664fc29;X1769e4522;X358a0f27a;X5a401bb1a;X718fea6b6;X83078d5b8;X86c98da2e;X99a04745b;Xb30b6e520;Xe12c1e06f;Xed0e43df5,12,Probabilistic Management of OCR Data using an RDBMS,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0718,2011
993,"Tags assigned by users to shared content can be ambiguous. As a possible solution, we propose semantic tagging as a collaborative process in which a user selects and associates Web resources drawn from a knowledge context. We applied this general technique in the specific context of online historical maps and allowed users to annotate and tag them. To study the effects of semantic tagging on tag production, the types and categories of obtained tags, and user task load, we conducted an in-lab within-subject experiment with 24 participants who annotated and tagged two distinct maps. We found that the semantic tagging implementation does not affect these parameters, while providing tagging relationships to well-defined concept definitions. Compared to label-based tagging, our technique also gathers positive and negative tagging relationships. We believe that our findings carry implications for designers who want to adopt semantic tagging in other contexts and systems on the Web.","Haslhofer, Bernhard;Robitza, Werner;Lagoze, Carl;Guimbretiere, Francois",ArXiv e-prints,X13e517ab0;X1d22ecc9f;X2b5ab5f69;X2bec4dc11;X2cdbb03f4;X352b15487;X385009923;X48d9c75e6;X4ec8e5b04;X52e57ef36;X61e4c97d1;X831e9fab9;X85c652316;X87a2e9a29;X88b381a04;X899b6d40a;X8cec027ba;X9e1b5f8ae;Xa081b6528;Xa3390bfea;Xdbefad347;Xf030ec64a;Xf8d3bf3cf,23,Semantic Tagging on Historical Maps,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1636,2013
994,"The aim of this paper is to review the features, benefits and limitations of the new scientific evaluation products derived from Google Scholar; Google Scholar Metrics and Google Scholar Citations, as well as the h-index which is the standard bibliometric indicator adopted by these services. It also outlines the potential of this new database as a source for studies in Biomedicine and compares the h-index obtained by the most relevant journals and researchers in the field of Intensive Care Medicine, by means of data extracted from Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar. Results show that, although average h-index values in Google Scholar are almost 30% higher than those obtained in Web of Science and about 15% higher than those collected by Scopus, there are no substantive changes in the rankings generated from either data source.

995,"A novel picture of the relative positions of countries in the world of science is offered through application of a two-dimensional mapping method which is based on quantity and quality indicators of the scientific production as peer-reviewed articles. To obtain such indicators, different influential effects such as the background global trends, temporal fluctuations, disciplinary characteristics, and mainly, the effect of countries resources have been taken into account. Fifty countries with the highest scientific production are studied in twelve years (1996-2007). A common clustering algorithm is used to detect groups of co-evolving countries in the two-dimensional map, and thereby countries are classified into four major clusters based on their relative positions in the two-dimensional map. The final results are in contrast with common views on relative positions of countries in the world of science, as demonstrated by considering some examples like USA, China or New Zealand. The proposed method and results thereof might influence the concept of 'scientific advancement' and the future scientific orientations of countries.","Jenab, Seyyed Mehdi Hosseini;Nejati, Ammar",ArXiv e-prints,X3df2823b9;X53ede4b41;X66b97a9c4;X9a63898fd;Xb6fb32d81;Xd1cd0d03a,6,Relative Positions of Countries in the World of Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2524,2013
996,"We describe a practical approach for visual exploration of research papers. Specifically, we use the titles of papers from the DBLP database to create what we call maps of computer science (MoCS). Words and phrases from the paper titles are the cities in the map, and countries are created based on word and phrase similarity, calculated using co-occurrence. With the help of heatmaps, we can visualize the profile of a particular conference or journal over the base map. Similarly, heatmap profiles can be made of individual researchers or groups such as a department. The visualization system also makes it possible to change the data used to generate the base map. For example, a specific journal or conference can be used to generate the base map and then the heatmap overlays can be used to show the evolution of research topics in the field over the years. As before, individual researchers or research groups profiles can be visualized using heatmap overlays but this time over the journal or conference base map. Finally, research papers or abstracts easily generate visual abstracts giving a visual representation of the distribution of topics in the paper. We outline a modular and extensible system for term extraction using natural language processing techniques, and show the applicability of methods of information retrieval to calculation of term similarity and creation of a topic map. The system is available at mocs.cs.arizona.edu.","Fried, Daniel;Kobourov, Stephen G.",ArXiv e-prints,X0a37f86a5;X101e4bbfa;X1777571ce;X1bf1c5117;X1c5c6d13e;X2679ea66b;X28641e830;X48f040027;X510cabee1;X540fb41b0;X55d5d7546;X68c76e5e8;X698c20b53;X6f555b9c3;X707b81ff0;X723f4a421;X75d38093c;X868cdacf3;Xa1b994b71;Xa472fc16a;Xacad2adb2;Xae3124b99;Xb05515bb7;Xb67412f4c;Xbd37280f0;Xc33cc3b80;Xc551f4554;Xc782a5486;Xca1cea60c;Xd1cd0d03a;Xdad6086b8;Xdb0469ffb;Xe00711c9f;Xecca7a55d;Xfb22e1dda,35,Maps of Computer Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2681,2013

998,"Replication of scientific experiments is critical to the advance of science. Unfortunately, the discipline of Computer Science has never treated replication seriously, even though computers are very good at doing the same thing over and over again. Not only are experiments rarely replicated, they are rarely even replicable in a meaningful way. Scientists are being encouraged to make their source code available, but this is only a small step. Even in the happy event that source code can be built and run successfully, running code is a long way away from being able to replicate the experiment that code was used for. I propose that the discipline of Computer Science must embrace replication of experiments as standard practice. I propose that the only credible technique to make experiments truly replicable is to provide copies of virtual machines in which the experiments are validated to run. I propose that tools and repositories should be made available to make this happen.

1001,"Here we show a novel technique for comparing subject categories, where the prestige of academic journals in each category is represented statistically by an impact-factor histogram. For each subject category we compute the probability of occurrence of scholarly journals with impact factor in different intervals. Here impact factor is measured with Thomson Reuters Impact Factor, Eigenfactor Score, and Immediacy Index. Assuming the probabilities associated with a pair of subject categories our objective is to measure the degree of dissimilarity between them. To do so, we use an axiomatic characterization for predicting dissimilarity between subject categories.

The former is best-in-class benchmarking that involves studying the leading competitor category; the latter is strategic benchmarking that involves observing how other scientific subject categories compete.","García, J.

1003,"Interactive query expansion can assist users during their query formulation process. We conducted a user study with over 4,000 unique visitors and four different design approaches for a search term suggestion service. As a basis for our evaluation we have implemented services which use three different vocabularies: (1) user search terms, (2) terms from a terminology service and (3) thesaurus terms. Additionally, we have created a new combined service which utilizes thesaurus term and terms from a domain-specific search term re-commender. Our results show that the thesaurus-based method clearly is used more often compared to the other single-method implementations. We interpret this as a strong indicator that term suggestion mechanisms should be domain-specific to be close to the user terminology. Our novel combined approach which interconnects a thesaurus service with additional statistical relations out-performed all other implementations. All our observations show that domain-specific vocabulary can support the user in finding alternative concepts and formulating queries.","Hienert, Daniel;Schaer, Philipp;Schaible, Johann;Mayr, Philipp",ArXiv e-prints,X9c46fdb05;Xec27009a3,2,A Novel Combined Term Suggestion Service for Domain-Specific Digital Libraries,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1523,2011

The search process typically can be separated into three major phases: query formulation and refinement, browsing through result lists and viewing and interacting with documents and their properties. We discuss a selection of popular visualization techniques that have been developed for the different phases to support the user during the search process. Along prototypes based on the different techniques we show how the approaches have been implemented. Although various visualizations have been developed in prototypical systems very few of these approaches have been adapted into today's DLs. We conclude that this is most likely due to the fact that most systems are not evaluated intensely in real-life scenarios with real information seekers and that results of the interesting visualization techniques are often not comparable. We can say that many of the assessed systems did not properly address the information need of cur-rent users.","van Hoek, Wilko;Mayr, Philipp",ArXiv e-prints,X1b088a621;X20c7f0a01;X2f9d99d7f;X4c857cee8;X5044dfbc3;X6b0f48301;X861175a7b;X912c93dca;X9d6a21e66;Xae137a386;Xbb78aca67,11,Assessing Visualization Techniques for the Search Process in Digital Libraries,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4119,2013

The data is compared to a model, where the review takes place in an ongoing competition of completing an important composite task with a large number of concurrent ones - a Deadline -effect.

1006,"Journal metrics are employed for the assessment of scientific scholar journals from a general bibliometric perspective. In this context, the Thomson Reuters journal impact factors (JIF) are the citation-based indicators most used. The 2-year journal impact factor (2-JIF) counts citations to one and two year old articles, while the 5-year journal impact factor (5-JIF) counts citations from one to five year old articles. Nevertheless, these indicators are not comparable among fields of science for two reasons: (i) each field has a different impact maturity time, and (ii) because of systematic differences in publication and citation behaviour across disciplines. In fact, the 5-JIF firstly appeared in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) in 2007 with the purpose of making more comparable impacts in fields in which impact matures slowly. However, there is not an optimal fixed impact maturity time valid for all the fields. In some of them two years provides a good performance whereas in others three or more years are necessary. Therefore, there is a problem when comparing a journal from a field in which impact matures slowly with a journal from a field in which impact matures rapidly. In this work, we propose the 2-year maximum journal impact factor (2M-JIF), a new impact indicator that considers the 2-year rolling citation time window of maximum impact instead of the previous 2-year time window. Finally, an empirical application comparing 2-JIF, 5-JIF, and 2M-JIF shows that the maximum rolling target window reduces the between-group variance with respect to the within-group variance in a random sample of about six hundred journals from eight different fields.","Dorta-Gonzalez, Pablo;Dorta-Gonzalez, Maria Isabel",ArXiv e-prints,X01c2df923;X0dec80b12;X1369c986b;X1bac04721;X228205bf9;X25680c19e;X2c586a944;X3e632f846;X47aa28294;X4dbee3646;X5ebc6c676;X8c5c26c61;X8d726f181;X8eb5a80c2;X935b7c6b6;X9bb9d9833;Xa3ab1a559;Xaa54190e0;Xaa669a65d;Xad63d9e43;Xb28d16a1f;Xba389a948;Xbd785a5e0;Xc284d5e59;Xc5d73e1d0;Xcb3407db8;Xe0137c946;Xeebb5d416;Xf1b2bcad5;Xf52246dee;Xf54030204;Xf725eafe3;Xfc1764373,33,Impact maturity times and citation time windows: The 2-year maximum journal impact factor,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5101,2013
1007,"The journal Impact Factor (IF) is not comparable among fields of Science and Social Science because of systematic differences in publication and citation behaviour across disciplines. In this work, a decomposing of the field aggregate impact factor into five normally distributed variables is presented. Considering these factors, a Principal Component Analysis is employed to find the sources of the variance in the JCR subject categories of Science and Social Science. Although publication and citation behaviour differs largely across disciplines, principal components explain more than 78% of the total variance and the average number of references per paper is not the primary factor explaining the variance in impact factors across categories. The Categories Normalized Impact Factor (CNIF) based on the JCR subject category list is proposed and compared with the IF. This normalization is achieved by considering all the indexing categories of each journal. An empirical application, with one hundred journals in two or more subject categories of economics and business, shows that the gap between rankings is reduced around 32% in the journals analyzed.

1008,"In the course of web research it is often necessary to estimate the creation datetime for web resources (in the general case, this value can only be estimated). While it is feasible to manually establish likely datetime values for small numbers of resources, this becomes infeasible if the collection is large. We present ""carbon date"", a simple web application that estimates the creation date for a URI by polling a number of sources of evidence and returning a machine-readable structure with their respective values. To establish a likely datetime, we poll bitly for the first time someone shortened the URI, topsy for the first time someone tweeted the URI, a Memento aggregator for the first time it appeared in a public web archive, Google's time of last crawl, and the Last-Modified HTTP response header of the resource itself. We also examine the backlinks of the URI as reported by Google and apply the same techniques for the resources that link to the URI. We evaluated our tool on a gold-standard data set of 1200 URIs in which the creation date was manually verified. We were able to estimate a creation date for 75.90% of the resources, with 32.78% having the correct value.

1009,"The citation distribution of a researcher shows the impact of their production and determines the success of their scientific career. However, its application in scientific evaluation is difficult due to the bi-dimensional character of the distribution. Some bibliometric indexes that try to synthesize in a numerical value the principal characteristics of this distribution have been proposed recently. In contrast with other bibliometric measures, the biases that the distribution tails provoke, are reduced by the h-index. However, some limitations in the discrimination among researchers with different publication habits are presented in this index. This index penalizes selective researchers, distinguished by the large number of citations received, as compared to large producers. In this work, two original sets of indexes, the central area indexes and the central interval indexes, that complement the h-index to include the central shape of the citation distribution, are proposed and compared.","Dorta-Gonzalez, Pablo;Dorta-Gonzalez, Maria Isabel",ArXiv e-prints,X07488ec6d;X4390dead2;X4dbee3646;X67c49bb18;Xa1b994b71;Xc39e616a0;Xca06ef65f;Xe0137c946;Xfc1764373,9,Central indexes to the citation distribution: A complement to the h-index,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5110,2013
1010,"Invenio is a free comprehensive web-based document repository and digital library software suite originally developed at CERN. It can serve a variety of use cases from an institutional repository or digital library to a web journal. In order to fully use full-text documents for efficient search and ranking, Solr was integrated into Invenio through a generic bridge. Solr indexes extracted full-texts and most relevant metadata. Consequently, Invenio takes advantage of Solr's efficient search and word similarity ranking capabilities. In this paper, we first give an overview of Invenio, its capabilities and features. We then present our open source Solr integration as well as scalability challenges that arose for an Invenio-based multi-million record repository: the CERN Document Server. We also compare our Solr adapter to an alternative Xapian adapter using the same generic bridge. Both integrations are distributed with the Invenio package and ready to be used by the institutions using or adopting Invenio.","Glauner, Patrick O.;Iwaszkiewicz, Jan;Le Meur, Jean-Yves;Simko, Tibor",ArXiv e-prints,X05d4c5908;X1cb9e368d;X207882baa;X21e5576bf;X2d0ce6e91;X34891d6f2;X3ca06e7f8;X46aae292e;X491fe76cf;X587db6176;X5de92228d;X69295f3fd;X86ecf830b;X8aa04af52;Xabd33ccec;Xbbd9af47d;Xbc7ed67f1;Xbd319754d;Xc829ef819;Xcd0639dca;Xd3864b1c4;Xdb7c4ee75;Xe2dae579f;Xf1bccb080;Xf20c58e36,25,Use of Solr and Xapian in the Invenio document repository software,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0250,2013

1013,"How can an author store digital information so that it will be reliably useful, even years later when he is no longer available to answer questions? Methods that might work are not good enough; what is preserved today should be reliably useful whenever someone wants it. Prior proposals fail because they confound saved data with irrelevant details of today's information technology--details that are difficult to define, extract, and save completely and accurately. We use a virtual machine to represent and eventually to render any data whatsoever. We focus on a case of intermediate difficulty--an executable procedure--and identify a variant for every other data type. This solution might be more elaborate than needed to render some text, image, audio, or video data. Simple data can be preserved as representations using well-known standards. We sketch practical methods for files ranging from simple structures to those containing computer programs, treating simple cases here and deferring complex cases for future work. Enough of the complete solution is known to enable practical aggressive preservation programs today.","Gladney, H. M.;Lorie, R.

We evaluate the performance of the algorithm to improve the resolution of mesoscopic network structures. To this end, we establish the ground truth for a sample of author names that is statistically representative of different types of nodes in the co-author network, distinguished by their role for the connectivity of the network. We finally observe that this distinction of node roles based on the mesoscopic structure of the network, in combination with a quantification of author name commonality, suggests a new approach to assess network distortion by homonymy and to analyze the reduction of distortion in the network after disambiguation, without requiring ground truth sampling.","Velden, Theresa;Haque, Asif-ul;Lagoze, Carl",ArXiv e-prints,5546739a5a;X02d27dc1e;X076b77b49;X09d7d1824;X26ebcd7a1;X33e91976c;X3da6d53b9;X42095cebb;X5c064f793;X66449777a;X72a2b326e;X7dc4a54d6;X8b2e09cad;X8ecb588bf;X9dce653f2;Xb2163d431;Xb8b6c2645;Xc680c40a2;Xe57083995;Xf37f3b68b;Xf3ad13206,21,Resolving Author Name Homonymy to Improve Resolution of Structures in Co-author Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2473,2011

We use an established domain-specific person name authority, the Getty Union List of Artist Names (ULAN), in order to externally identify relevant actors. Besides containing consistent biographical person data, this database also provides associative relationships between its person records, serving as a reference link structure for comparison. As a first step, we use mappings between the ULAN and English Dbpedia provided by the Virtual Internet Authority File (VIAF). This way, we are able to identify 18,002 relevant person articles.

This paper brings together multiple perspectives: from individual researchers seeking the best options to display their activities and market their skills on the academic job market; to academic institutions, national funding agencies, and countries needing to monitor the science system and account for public money spending. We also address the research interests aimed at better understanding the self-organising and complex nature of the science system through researcher tracing, the identification of the emergence of new fields, and knowledge discovery using large-data mining and non-linear dynamics. In particular this paper draws attention to the need for standardisation and data interoperability in the area of research information as an indispensable pre-condition for any science modelling. We discuss which levels of complexity are needed to provide a globally, interoperable, and expressive data infrastructure for research information. With possible dynamic science model applications in mind, we introduce the need for a ""middle-range"" level of complexity for data representation and propose a conceptual model for research data based on a core international ontology with national and local extensions.","Guéret, Christophe;Chambers, Tamy;Reijnhoudt, Linda;van der Most, Frank;Scharnhorst, Andrea",ArXiv e-prints,X04db9b81f;X13660f829;X188c773d6;X18bff2d9d;X19aee4d5c;X24475cd66;X26901823e;X2dff61fdd;X312fa8baa;X340dd404d;X393087a9e;X504b573d1;X5a72e6a96;X5f3da438b;X643489fc1;X647713e67;X697f36432;X74c1e3117;X7c42e8ee0;X854b3e855;X8b25f8fec;X95aeea950;X978338717;Xa02bc1d81;Xa1b994b71;Xa21548860;Xa41b998da;Xb68307154;Xbe4e39122;Xc60597252;Xe36e5e5fb;Xe5c021d97;Xefa99e201;Xf90dfb040,34,Genericity versus expressivity - an exercise in semantic interoperable research information systems for Web Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5743,2013

1020,"Previous work indicates that over the past 20 years, the highest quality work have been published in an increasingly diverse and larger group of journals. In this paper we examine whether this diversification has also affected the handful of elite journals that are traditionally considered to be the best. We examine citation patterns over the past 40 years of 7 long-standing traditionally elite journals and 6 journals that have been increasing in importance over the past 20 years. To be among the top 5% or 1% cited papers, papers now need about twice as many citations as they did 40 years ago. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s elite journals have been publishing a decreasing proportion of these top cited papers. This also applies to the two journals that are typically considered as the top venues and often used as bibliometric indicators of ""excellence"", Science and Nature. On the other hand, several new and established journals are publishing an increasing proportion of most cited papers. These changes bring new challenges and opportunities for all parties. Journals can enact policies to increase or maintain their relative position in the journal hierarchy. Researchers now have the option to publish in more diverse venues knowing that their work can still reach the same audiences. Finally, evaluators and administrators need to know that although there will always be a certain prestige associated with publishing in ""elite"" journals, journal hierarchies are in constant flux so inclusion of journals into this group is not permanent.","Lariviere, Vincent;Lozano, George A.;Gingras, Yves",ArXiv e-prints,X05b00a650;X07bbe0aa2;X07c20c0b2;X0a9d075a7;X0abebdda2;X18bff2d9d;X192109981;X19ac28571;X19c910d71;X1b428b7a5;X1f392e2c6;X21f2cf7fc;X2a7efa9c1;X2abb24e41;X2b47f4ce8;X2c8732e96;X2dc0798ee;X2ead9938b;X31d04a13d;X32e2e5f59;X348814447;X37206498f;X37ced626d;X39a8cac2d;X3ce5b5901;X4157e801c;X43c78ab2b;X498120198;X4c1b6d5d2;X4f20e3b9e;X5005ff7d9;X527d043c7;X552f1642f;X5a72e6a96;X5b990050c;X5d2f1264f;X5dcee7c04;X5f9b251f9;X610cce0df;X61c443497;X677967ee3;X6974142b8;X69afa6373;X69e140b5b;X700cd4198;X74c43a30b;X7b12adac0;X7c42e8ee0;X8249adb30;X854b3e855;X86c487c6e;X88df079f5;X898d74472;X89ac31de9;X933a6ccb4;X93fa10f47;X9879ebf5f;X9a0a0345a;X9dc71f356;Xa0ef1a250;Xa14f38f4b;Xa1b994b71;Xa8b49f88b;Xa99a1032f;Xadd66b30a;Xafc83bd12;Xafe1ea12b;Xb1875d7bd;Xb3510f4e7;Xb59cbb517;Xb921ace92;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbed22e95a;Xc14780846;Xc30e3b9aa;Xc4b73eef0;Xd011d9c1b;Xd3f86c2bb;Xd722b558a;Xdaca6ab38;Xdb9f9393e;Xe36e5e5fb;Xe5283b6b2;Xf06ba467c;Xf3b223276;Xf5e7c9ca5;Xf8062c287;Xf9cc8f8a9,89,Are elite journals declining?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6460,2013

1022,"As scholars migrate into online spaces like Mendeley, blogs, Twitter, and more, they leave new traces of once-invisible interactions like reading, saving, discussing, and recommending. Observing these traces can inform new metrics of scholarly influence and impact -- so-called ""altmetrics."" Stakeholders in academia are beginning to discuss how and where altmetrics can be useful towards evaluating a researcher's academic contribution. As this interest grows, libraries are in a unique position to help support an informed dialog on campus. We suggest that librarians can provide this support in three main ways: informing emerging conversations with the latest research, supporting experimentation with emerging altmetrics tools, and engaging in early altmetrics education and outreach. We include examples and lists of resources to help librarians fill these roles.","Lapinski, Scott;Piwowar, Heather;Priem, Jason",ArXiv e-prints,X0256234df;X025c111e6;X042c7a307;X07341573e;X0933b7d5d;X0a9d075a7;X16c3fb372;X30cd2689b;X39a8cac2d;X3cb37b08f;X41c058061;X4879ac23e;X56d24900b;X6816f91d0;X72e2f2c0b;X8028752c2;X84cc3ee87;X883d33d66;X9156758d1;X94ba7afb2;X9898ffe69;X9cd764f08;Xa1b994b71;Xa6c674ef4;Xa94f3b3e4;Xaa1180c04;Xbc86e6e64;Xc10942078;Xc9554cc9a;Xd6faa8de9;Xded34e55b;Xea626a185;Xef41eef2d;Xf4d47f1db;Xf6b00f5c1;Xfb324bc06,36,Riding the crest of the altmetrics wave: How librarians can help prepare faculty for the next generation of research impact metrics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3328,2013
1023,"Understanding the dynamics of research production and collaboration may reveal better strategies for scientific careers, academic institutions and funding agencies. Here we propose the use of a large and multidisciplinar database of scientific curricula in Brazil, namely, the Lattes Platform, to study patterns of scientific production and collaboration. In this database, detailed information about publications and researchers are made available by themselves so that coauthorship is unambiguous and individuals can be evaluated by scientific productivity, geographical location and field of expertise. Our results show that the collaboration network is growing exponentially for the last three decades, with a distribution of number of collaborators per researcher that approaches a power-law as the network gets older. Moreover, both the distributions of number of collaborators and production per researcher obey power-law behaviors, regardless of the geographical location or field, suggesting that the same universal mechanism might be responsible for network growth and productivity.We also show that the collaboration network under investigation displays a typical assortative mixing behavior, where teeming researchers (i.e., with high degree) tend to collaborate with others alike. Finally, our analysis reveals that the distinctive collaboration profile of researchers awarded with governmental scholarships suggests a strong bonus impact on their productivity.","Araújo, Eduardo B.;Moreira, André A.;Furtado, Vasco;Pequeno, Tarcisio H.

Using Colombian publications from 1991 until 2011 in the Web of Science, we investigate the relationship between the degree of interdisciplinarity and the local orientation of the articles. We find that a higher degree of interdisciplinarity in a publication is associated with a greater emphasis on Colombian issues. In particular, our results suggest that research that combines cognitively disparate disciplines, what we refer to as distal interdisciplinarity, tends to be associated with more local focus of research.

Publication is becoming a major project component. At a minimum, a project must preserve the ephemeral data it gathers. Derived data can be reconstructed from metadata, but metadata is ephemeral. Longer term, a project should expect some archive to preserve the data. We observe that published scientific data needs to be available forever -- this gives rise to the data pyramid of versions and to data inflation where the derived data volumes explode. As an example, this article describes the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) strategies for data publication, data access, curation, and preservation.","Gray, Jim;Szalay, Alexander S.;Thakar, Ani R.;Stoughton, Christopher;vandenBerg, Jan",Virtual Observatories,54f8abeb04;X008163863;X00b3045e1;X07f4396cc;X0c11d0fe6;X21b7651ee;X21feee1a9;X2b6c637c6;X2d557df83;X31012ac82;X527fe6c3c;X697f36432;X7383f461c;X7c11b86fc;X7cc097ce8;X8db9f7c43;Xa41fc8436;Xb04b06555;Xc3fe5575d;Xc44fe0924;Xc6721803f;Xec2645092;Xee0ab0f9a;Xff0c991b8,24,"Online Scientific Data Curation, Publication, and Archiving",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0208012,2002
1026,"We propose a new index, the $j$-index, which is defined for an author as the sum of the square roots of the numbers of citations to each of the author's publications. The idea behind the $j$-index it to remedy a drawback of the $h$-index $-$ that the $h$-index does not take into account the full citation record of a researcher. The square root function is motivated by our desire to avoid the possible bias that may occur with a simple sum when an author has several very highly cited papers. We compare the $j$-index to the $h$-index, the $g$-index and the total citation count for three subject areas using several association measures. Our results indicate that that the association between the $j$-index and the other indices varies according to the subject area. One explanation of this variation may be due to the proportion of citations to publications of the researcher that are in the $h$-core. The $j$-index is {\em not} an $h$-index variant, and as such is intended to complement rather than necessarily replace the $h$-index and other bibliometric indicators, thus providing a more complete picture of a researcher's achievements.","Levene, Mark;Fenner, Trevor;Bar-Ilan, Judit",ArXiv e-prints,X074b57667;X57a7e63e6;Xe42a825f4,3,A bibliometric index based on the complete list of cited publications,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6945,2013

That is, we suggest that a paper that involves a computer program not be accepted for publication unless the source code becomes publicly available. The adoption of such a policy by editors, editorial boards, and reviewers will improve the ability to replicate scientific results, and will also make computational astronomy methods more available to other researchers who wish to apply them to their data.","Shamir, Lior;Wallin, John F.;Allen, Alice;Berriman, Bruce;Teuben, Peter;Nemiroff, Robert J.;Mink, Jessica;Hanisch, Robert J.;DuPrie, Kimberly",Astronomy and Computing,4201071e72;45e449297c;5318ae2b42;54612ff56a;X016ed1118;X032dfbd7d;X063fe6a65;X0abff46a9;X0bfa21fad;X0c4d309fb;X0d931983a;X13d1f2abd;X1a59e59bc;X1eec045f8;X2af0a8b8e;X2e969c9c8;X3e461c0d8;X405260298;X48a6fc1b9;X4d2107c3f;X533662ed2;X5b95f439d;X5d21e31d8;X60eb4d5af;X664ea2547;X69e140b5b;X6dc864503;X7a947097a;X7bcf2b1a6;X8aebcc68c;X9988c9d09;Xa15c723b5;Xb33893697;Xba56fadea;Xc424f8d50;Xc60622333;Xcd797bd41;Xcd8b758e3;Xd488c7908;Xe2d576c82;Xe5c8e3aed;Xfae153554;Xfd602af61,43,Practices in source code sharing in astrophysics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6780,2013

1030,"Provenance is a critical ingredient for establishing trust of published scientific content. This is true whether we are considering a data set, a computational workflow, a peer-reviewed publication or a simple scientific claim with supportive evidence. Existing vocabularies such as DC Terms and the W3C PROV-O are domain-independent and general-purpose and they allow and encourage for extensions to cover more specific needs. We identify the specific need for identifying or distinguishing between the various roles assumed by agents manipulating digital artifacts, such as author, contributor and curator. We present the Provenance, Authoring and Versioning ontology (PAV): a lightweight ontology for capturing just enough descriptions essential for tracking the provenance, authoring and versioning of web resources. We argue that such descriptions are essential for digital scientific content. PAV distinguishes between contributors, authors and curators of content and creators of representations in addition to the provenance of originating resources that have been accessed, transformed and consumed. We explore five projects (and communities) that have adopted PAV illustrating their usage through concrete examples. Moreover, we present mappings that show how PAV extends the PROV-O ontology to support broader interoperability. The authors strived to keep PAV lightweight and compact by including only those terms that have demonstrated to be pragmatically useful in existing applications, and by recommending terms from existing ontologies when plausible. We analyze and compare PAV with related approaches, namely Provenance Vocabulary, DC Terms and BIBFRAME. We identify similarities and analyze their differences with PAV, outlining strengths and weaknesses of our proposed model.

1031,"Altmetrics, indices based on social media platforms and tools, have recently emerged as alternative means of measuring scholarly impact. Such indices assume that scholars in fact populate online social environments, and interact with scholarly products there. We tested this assumption by examining the use and coverage of social media environments amongst a sample of bibliometricians. As expected, coverage varied: 82% of articles published by sampled bibliometricians were included in Mendeley libraries, while only 28% were included in CiteULike. Mendeley bookmarking was moderately correlated (.45) with Scopus citation. Over half of respondents asserted that social media tools were affecting their professional lives, although uptake of online tools varied widely. 68% of those surveyed had LinkedIn accounts, while Academia.edu, Mendeley, and ResearchGate each claimed a fifth of respondents. Nearly half of those responding had Twitter accounts, which they used both personally and professionally. Surveyed bibliometricians had mixed opinions on altmetrics' potential; 72% valued download counts, while a third saw potential in tracking articles' influence in blogs, Wikipedia, reference managers, and social media. Altogether, these findings suggest that some online tools are seeing substantial use by bibliometricians, and that they present a potentially valuable source of impact data.","Haustein, Stefanie;Peters, Isabella;Bar-Ilan, Judit;Priem, Jason;Shema, Hadas;Terliesner, Jens",ArXiv e-prints,X01a466841;X03ab63edf;X048299ba0;X05a8a5d10;X066fea887;X0954e8445;X0b30fbadc;X0c3bbc4d7;X0e2476f4d;X0e5f08279;X10617850f;X12d62b95e;X25db0ffdc;X26056b2b5;X2a0ab0cf0;X2e5b137c7;X375cffc4c;X3baa6c751;X3e11b0f57;X3ecc19ed3;X4b34c79ef;X5c1ca36d7;X5e904f0dd;X5f0a07943;X5fbfef0b2;X63ce00f74;X664ea2547;X6c74a1aa2;X75eb79fc2;X86879847d;X8c1b2ba5d;X91769129c;X920cc367d;X955ced0cb;X9717a3f07;X9917452c8;X99fa40989;X9bacaaf39;X9cf708c1a;Xa1b994b71;Xa1f35fbbc;Xa659a8bc4;Xa94f3b3e4;Xb05ccdce2;Xb81cddb93;Xb86bdf63c;Xc4a40f427;Xc8c86a189;Xca20dbb99;Xcddea854a;Xce97130fd;Xe0296eee8;Xe12e7a495;Xe36068f8c;Xe4d042885;Xe55a231ea;Xebf877705;Xf0de37f60;Xf4799c5a3;Xf781688a8;Xf7be1cb81;Xfafd1722a;Xfb5997416;Xfe5534078,64,Coverage and adoption of altmetrics sources in the bibliometric community,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7300,2013

In both networks, the l-index has a poor correlation with betweenness but correlates with degree and Eigenvector centralities.

1034,"Many collective human activities have been shown to exhibit universal patterns. However, the possibility of universal patterns across timing events of researcher migration has barely been explored at global scale. Here, we show that timing events of migration within different countries exhibit remarkable similarities. Specifically, we look at the distribution governing the data of researcher migration inferred from the web. Compiling the data in itself represents a significant advance in the field of quantitative analysis of migration patterns. Official and commercial records are often access restricted, incompatible between countries, and especially not registered across researchers. Instead, we introduce GeoDBLP where we propagate geographical seed locations retrieved from the web across the DBLP database of 1,080,958 authors and 1,894,758 papers. But perhaps more important is that we are able to find statistical patterns and create models that explain the migration of researchers. For instance, we show that the science job market can be treated as a Poisson process with individual propensities to migrate following a log-normal distribution over the researcher's career stage. That is, although jobs enter the market constantly, researchers are generally not ""memoryless"" but have to care greatly about their next move. The propensity to make k〉1 migrations, however, follows a gamma distribution suggesting that migration at later career stages is ""memoryless"". This aligns well but actually goes beyond scientometric models typically postulated based on small case studies. On a very large, transnational scale, we establish the first general regularities that should have major implications on strategies for education and research worldwide.","Hadiji, Fabian;Kersting, Kristian;Bauckhage, Christian;Ahmadi, Babak",ArXiv e-prints,X162d362a0;X1b76d3f1f;X1d3ebc505;X3b19bdaf9;X3d2a30423;X3d8237445;X4eb26bf31;X4fcb4d4bb;X708d0e741;X7b638bf07;X8095a04c2;X8ba954667;X8ff0c1ccf;Xa1b994b71;Xbb9327eef;Xd45ab957a;Xeaab1f67a;Xf59b1512e;Xfbbf09434,19,GeoDBLP: Geo-Tagging DBLP for Mining the Sociology of Computer Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7984,2013
1035,"The application of conventional phylogenetic techniques for inferring cultural history is problematic due to differences in the nature of information transmission in biological and cultural realms. In culture, units of transmission are not just measurable attributes, but communicable concepts. Therefore, relatedness amongst cultural elements often resides at the conceptual level not captured by traditional phylogenetic methods. This paper takes a cognitively inspired approach to analyzing material cultural history. We show that combining data for physical attributes of cultural artifacts with conceptual information can uncover cultural influences among different ethnolinguistic groups, and reveal new patterns of cultural ancestry. Using the Baltic psaltery, a musical instrument with a well-documented ethnographic and archaeological record, we recovered a previously unacknowledged pattern of historical relationship that is more congruent with geographical distribution and temporal data than is obtained with other approaches.","Veloz, Tomas;Temkin, Ilya;Gabora, Liane",ArXiv e-prints,X1681881b4;X192c85611;X1a15b83ae;X221627c11;X47c69cc58;X53cff6b78;X685a64c83;X844f0de4c;Xc504b28ed;Xfb8979f0d,10,A Conceptual Network-Based Approach to Inferring the Cultural Evolutionary History of the Baltic Psaltery,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0737,2013
1036,"The publication culture in Computer Science is different from that of all other disciplines. Whereas other disciplines focus on journal publication, the standard practice in CS has been to publish in a conference and then (sometimes) publish a journal version of the conference paper. We discuss the role of journal publication in CS. Indeed, it is through publication in selective, leading conferences that the quality of CS research is typically assessed.","Halpern, Joseph Y.;Parkes, David C.",ArXiv e-prints,X05512ec7e;X25e0af8fb;X6772add73;Xc230207e6;Xd5bf11dda;Xda6c6b095,6,"Viewpoint: Journals for Certification, Conferences for Rapid Dissemination",http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2649,2011
1037,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the evaluation of the effectiveness of the bibliometric technique Bradfordizing in an information retrieval (IR) scenario. Bradfordizing is used to re-rank topical document sets from conventional abstracting & indexing (A&I) databases into core and more peripheral document zones. Bradfordized lists of journal articles and monographs will be tested in a controlled scenario consisting of different A&I databases from social and political sciences, economics, psychology and medical science, 164 standardized IR topics and intellectual assessments of the listed documents. Does Bradfordizing improve the ratio of relevant documents in the first third (core) compared to the second and last third (zone 2 and zone 3, respectively)? The IR tests show that relevance distributions after re-ranking improve at a significant level if documents in the core are compared with documents in the succeeding zones. After Bradfordizing of document pools, the core has a significant better average precision than zone 2, zone 3 and baseline. This paper should be seen as an argument in favour of alternative non-textual (bibliometric) re-ranking methods which can be simply applied in text-based retrieval systems and in particular in A&I databases.","Mayr, Philipp",ArXiv e-prints,X07fa43afd;X18bff2d9d;X1d5da83cb;X236c03b0d;X3facf9566;X5a72e6a96;X6e996bbc9;X7e35657d7;X854b3e855;X866e5ddd7;X8c2f58aea;X92f2197e0;Xa2766c7b6;Xb17c1e519;Xb3e47aa3f;Xc33557776;Xdb3fc0bdf;Xdbd6c1141,18,Relevance distributions across Bradford Zones: Can Bradfordizing improve search?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0357,2013
1038,"Nowadays, the worlds scientific community has been publishing an enormous number of papers in different scientific fields. In such environment, it is essential to know which databases are equally efficient and objective for literature searches. It seems that two most extensive databases are Web of Science and Scopus. Besides searching the literature, these two databases used to rank journals in terms of their productivity and the total citations received to indicate the journals impact, prestige or influence. This article attempts to provide a comprehensive comparison of these databases to answer frequent questions which researchers ask, such as: How Web of Science and Scopus are different? In which aspects these two databases are similar? Or, if the researchers are forced to choose one of them, which one should they prefer? For answering these questions, these two databases will be compared based on their qualitative and quantitative characteristics.","Aghaei Chadegani, Arezoo;Salehi, Hadi;Yunus, Melor Md;Farhadi,

1039,"Journal impact factor (IF) as a gauge of influence and impact of a particular journal comparing with other journals in the same area of research, reports the mean number of citations to the published articles in particular journal. Although, IF attracts more attention and being used more frequently than other measures, it has been subjected to criticisms, which overcome the advantages of IF. Critically, extensive use of IF may result in destroying editorial and researchers behaviour, which could compromise the quality of scientific articles. Therefore, it is the time of the timeliness and importance of a new invention of journal ranking techniques beyond the journal impact factor.","Fooladi, Masood;Salehi, Hadi;Yunus, Melor Md;Farhadi, Maryam;Aghaei Chadegani, Arezoo;Farhadi, Hadi;Ale Ebrahim, Nader",ArXiv e-prints,X048cdb16b;X04fc7d549;X0628ce894;X063fe6a65;X06a7a9056;X0e538e2e1;X0f12ecac1;X121a2e445;X13c35c2b0;X144fd642c;X147ed68d0;X15362ccce;X15feeed86;X170670a83;X18f91b509;X1adba0f9f;X1af3c75ae;X1f241f227;X1f6c845e1;X2129cdfd0;X275b55e75;X285169ea9;X2aa565d0d;X34e880c0b;X35e05c2e0;X361531c6b;X37a5f8f17;X3cc1bfd2f;X3d276f3a9;X3dda63edc;X3ea8c238f;X3eae0597a;X40738cb1c;X41e4a6f32;X421edbee8;X42fe7df4c;X462ff1f56;X48024d8a4;X4d49f9171;X54c0754c3;X5988f6522;X5a8d2d029;X5b8602ff9;X5bba332e9;X5d259a301;X5d899bd61;X656507392;X65d76e432;X690e4f45c;X69ce7c311;X6c07b962d;X6d7c0d472;X6de5cbcdb;X6e52b7d38;X72bc43d18;X730ece864;X746ec965b;X756607ce5;X75b7f8356;X7944abaf9;X7ae835cd3;X7c3c0a8e5;X7d0fde2ed;X7de5bacd0;X7eba17917;X8646583bf;X87db25ec1;X8a574c2fb;X8a5e97299;X8f109fb0f;X8f1e76fe3;X93f1e914f;X962134c10;X97f663721;X9b71059a1;X9b952f3e5;X9b9d5c6aa;X9f4b685a2;Xa05c5ac6e;Xa27c5cfbd;Xa38c53a47;Xa4b2d3200;Xa8fd41c63;Xab5d2fbb3;Xabf5ef453;Xac502a04e;Xada84fd72;Xadc9f66f2;Xb3f505a24;Xb4068e20e;Xb4fcf18c7;Xb53580059;Xb74c719da;Xb995725ba;Xbbd20b8a5;Xbe2593025;Xbfc72b22b;Xc02b506a8;Xc151bfc4e;Xc1b8505e3;Xc1e2fff34;Xc1fd35778;Xc5addc99a;Xc612551b5;Xc683aa6af;Xc6ea3fd7b;Xcbf4c2052;Xcd4a1e490;Xcec3fa77c;Xd0cbb776a;Xd125b5102;Xd12b94fda;Xd4136e3bf;Xd7a908732;Xd7c598a80;Xd90fcbddf;Xd925a4ab9;Xda1a77190;Xda77ddecf;Xde95c6e1f;Xe1d5848f4;Xe40647a28;Xe623e97c1;Xee390d0f6;Xee549432c;Xef6634cd7;Xf0fd6d46d;Xf27a4ff65;Xf301f326b;Xf33b5d77a;Xf6c6e4331;Xf7251b797;Xfee26ac4a;Xff53fbde9,134,Does Criticisms Overcome the Praises of Journal Impact Factor?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0379,2013
1040,"Twitter is a micro-blogging social media platform for short messages that can have a long-term impact on how scientists create and publish ideas. We investigate the usefulness of twitter in the development and distribution of scientific knowledge. At the start of the life cycle of a scientific publication, twitter provides a large virtual department of colleagues that can help to rapidly generate, share and refine new ideas. As ideas become manuscripts, twitter can be used as an informal arena for the pre-review of works in progress. Finally, tweeting published findings can communicate research to a broad audience of other researchers, decision makers, journalists and the general public that can amplify the scientific and social impact of publications. However, there are limitations, largely surrounding issues of intellectual property and ownership, inclusiveness and misrepresentations of science sound bites. Nevertheless, we believe twitter is a useful social media tool that can provide a valuable contribution to scientific publishing in the 21st century.","Darling1, Emily S.;Shiffman, David;Côté, Isabelle M.;Drew, Joshua A.",ArXiv e-prints,X00e1301ea;X01c739ca6;X0225e1b4d;X033827a78;X03450b51d;X03745783e;X03ab63edf;X075d67a4d;X09963d18a;X0a793bcca;X0b5f8bdaf;X0b6f71535;X10c9a72a3;X124098d9d;X12c642fec;X13489a5bc;X15183a9d9;X1519d53a7;X1689eab18;X184fc8990;X1927f60bd;X195f1d54e;X19b00d492;X1b25f7229;X1c732f809;X1d601431b;X1e613273d;X1ec49392d;X1fd6873c6;X20abdf17f;X21da2f280;X2379c9977;X23899d101;X262e32a3c;X26c9179fc;X285ed5aef;X28945ad7a;X2d3306bf0;X2e236f6cb;X2e2fe0083;X31b1eaf00;X337363dc3;X343195dd4;X353a6ba93;X3ac0d6d8e;X3ae53aebd;X3b9eaa4a0;X3c3c0d321;X41df9d22e;X4fd2b5406;X57e6720b2;X58913790e;X58a56a00c;X5b15a5f20;X5ba8b2fd9;X5cbdcb1ce;X5dcee7c04;X5f0a07943;X60747bc1f;X60a6e2fa3;X667ae16fa;X67a5a37fa;X69e140b5b;X69f183701;X6d2288813;X6fc6944d8;X6fe79451e;X73500bf27;X7401e6350;X7a250f99e;X7a7761e65;X7aa84348f;X7d1ebf4fc;X7fc6f4137;X7fd09ea86;X80874889c;X82690b573;X849106f1f;X86e4c447d;X8d5e84a72;X8ffcdd814;X91a0f2c0e;X926b3f5fd;X950eaccd0;X968bc22fc;X9bb9cb365;X9bda9a76a;Xa1852765c;Xa6620f8ca;Xa8d8abfa6;Xab6f5a179;Xb2637261d;Xb2ea54543;Xb2f0f73d7;Xb65c85e52;Xb989b58cd;Xbb8730a1e;Xbc79c5827;Xbce5bfa29;Xbd3c04a77;Xc105fbaa9;Xc194eed84;Xc371476bd;Xc63448b3a;Xc6be5f18d;Xc6eb38a01;Xcc916f87a;Xce3a139af;Xd027aa1c9;Xd27a2cfff;Xd2cc92249;Xd5cd7d1f8;Xd5f0dbb6a;Xd9fbccc45;Xdb0b52315;Xdbba6a518;Xdc35c52ec;Xdc6fed60c;Xe06aa19a6;Xe3f3a8131;Xe4f634498;Xe5df5f2ff;Xe6c5caa94;Xe828bdfdf;Xe9f306d6c;Xeb3298c5e;Xec222b2d8;Xed55b0483;Xeff742dfc;Xf13753daf;Xf85b0941e;Xfe38d5ab7;Xfe7fb6d71;Xffe64e124,134,The role of twitter in the life cycle of a scientific publication,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0435,2013

1042,"Large formal mathematical libraries consist of millions of atomic inference steps that give rise to a corresponding number of proved statements (lemmas). Analogously to the informal mathematical practice, only a tiny fraction of such statements is named and re-used in later proofs by formal mathematicians. In this work, we suggest and implement criteria defining the estimated usefulness of the HOL Light lemmas for proving further theorems. We use these criteria to mine the large inference graph of all lemmas in the core HOL Light library, adding thousands of the best lemmas to the pool of named statements that can be re-used in later proofs. The usefulness of the new lemmas is then evaluated by comparing the performance of automated proving of the core HOL Light theorems with and without such added lemmas.","Kaliszyk, Cezary;Urban, Josef",ArXiv e-prints,X390d78673;X3f9771978;X4efcb216e;X4f06f3da2;X60d06b9ea;X8ec30179e;Xa3fbe50bf;Xa693759c3;Xfcdad2f9b,9,Lemma Mining over HOL Light,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2797,2013

To achieve that, a large suite of AI/ATP methods is employed and further developed. We implement the most useful methods efficiently, to scale them to the 150000 formulas in MML.

1046,"The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is popular for expressing controlled vocabularies, such as taxonomies, classifications, etc., for their use in Semantic Web applications. Using SKOS, concepts can be linked to other concepts and organized into hierarchies inside a single terminology system. Meanwhile, expressing mappings between concepts in different terminology systems is also possible. This paper discusses potential quality issues in using SKOS to express these terminology mappings. Problematic patterns are defined and corresponding rules are developed to automatically detect situations where the mappings either result in 'SKOS Vocabulary Hijacking' to the source vocabularies or cause conflicts. An example of using the rules to validate sample mappings between two clinical terminologies is given. The validation rules, expressed in N3 format, are available as open source.","Sun, Hong;De Roo, Jos;Twagirumukiza, Marc;Mels, Giovanni;Depraetere, Kristof;De Vloed, Boris;Colaert, Dirk",ArXiv e-prints,X0a4d2533e;X0d61e812a;X0f2f14a00;X1dae400e4;X3c5430aca;X58af12aaa;X60d06b9ea;X67a491dd4;X80a3632f9;X8358dd162;X899b6d40a;Xba9f072e0;Xc2a842c4e;Xf1b0abc16,14,Validation Rules for Assessing and Improving SKOS Mapping Quality,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4156,2013
1047,"Data collected by social media platforms have recently been introduced as a new source for indicators to help measure the impact of scholarly research in ways that are complementary to traditional citation-based indicators. Data generated from social media activities related to scholarly content can be used to reflect broad types of impact. This paper aims to provide systematic evidence regarding how often Twitter is used to diffuse journal articles in the biomedical and life sciences. The analysis is based on a set of 1.4 million documents covered by both PubMed and Web of Science (WoS) and published between 2010 and 2012. The number of tweets containing links to these documents was analyzed to evaluate the degree to which certain journals, disciplines, and specialties were represented on Twitter. It is shown that, with less than 10% of PubMed articles mentioned on Twitter, its uptake is low in general. The relationship between tweets and WoS citations was examined for each document at the level of journals and specialties. The results show that tweeting behavior varies between journals and specialties and correlations between tweets and citations are low, implying that impact metrics based on tweets are different from those based on citations. A framework utilizing the coverage of articles and the correlation between Twitter mentions and citations is proposed to facilitate the evaluation of novel social-media based metrics and to shed light on the question in how far the number of tweets is a valid metric to measure research impact.","Haustein, Stefanie;Peters, Isabella;Sugimoto, Cassidy R.;Thelwall, Mike;Larivière, Vincent",ArXiv e-prints,55387ea740;X00bd80b2c;X0176a222e;X01f1209ef;X07e837cf9;X0c4f31440;X132adcb73;X137d5573c;X16dd47b43;X208a33366;X24ac169c3;X290c7e9c1;X296a8f36e;X2c93db767;X2d7333ef5;X3632fcbf8;X3aacee174;X3d200cda3;X4164f034a;X42e5f2313;X4371352c0;X44af1af45;X44c441e1c;X461768986;X48dfa024d;X4b0703a92;X4ccf67068;X51578af2f;X53b7499e7;X53f29fec0;X5c74e1f4f;X625c9868f;X652e41e00;X653d01671;X69e140b5b;X6d5693608;X6e3dc968f;X6e44b0e5a;X7549f250d;X7a3b2c5eb;X7ad6e3191;X7b35ac259;X7f491a0c7;X7f71c65a3;X82b0d75c5;X831025bda;X87c126cc8;X8800dd6c0;X8ecfb9722;X8fe894c02;X92fbd9112;X937a3501e;X94acad04d;X956ca24b0;X9b625fd1a;X9e33be8d9;X9edc2c014;Xa03a7d861;Xa1b994b71;Xa7dd35270;Xa7e1398d9;Xa9fa3c74d;Xadd682692;Xb0085e068;Xb0b6151d7;Xb7097ee76;Xb767275b5;Xba5a29b9c;Xbc7245404;Xbd38782ac;Xbe834b3e4;Xbfd7f9dc6;Xc2fff1b33;Xc48b05d25;Xc54e7f700;Xc5d934128;Xc75b75864;Xc77442e90;Xc8f5e42b1;Xca5a4c7a5;Xcddea854a;Xd3c06b763;Xd7d3213d0;Xdde5aa3ac;Xe08a489bd;Xe439a73b4;Xe6549346a;Xe670b5cda;Xe94223fbe;Xebf475012;Xece981824;Xed0451dbc;Xeeb071c99;Xf1ebbbcb7;Xf2fa82b57;Xf5da70aea;Xfa8c41d8e;Xfabe3c4b0;Xfb6688200;Xfc75f4171;Xfdbd87341,101,Tweeting biomedicine: an analysis of tweets and citations in the biomedical literature,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1838,2013
1048,"Individual-intelligence research, from a neurological perspective, discusses the hierarchical layers of the cortex as a structure that performs conceptual abstraction and specification. This theory has been used to explain how motor-cortex regions responsible for different behavioral modalities such as writing and speaking can be utilized to express the same general concept represented higher in the cortical hierarchy. For example, the concept of a dog, represented across a region of high-level cortical-neurons, can either be written or spoken about depending on the individual's context. The higher-layer cortical areas project down the hierarchy, sending abstract information to specific regions of the motor-cortex for contextual implementation. In this paper, this idea is expanded to incorporate collective-intelligence within a hyper-cortical construct. This hyper-cortex is a multi-layered network used to represent abstract collective concepts. These ideas play an important role in understanding how collective-intelligence systems can be engineered to handle problem abstraction and solution specification. Finally, a collection of common problems in the scientific community are solved using an artificial hyper-cortex generated from digital-library metadata.","Rodriguez, Marko A.",ArXiv e-prints,X1078b0fc0;X2cb497434;X400f45731;X49dc12856;X6858f131f;X69b66bae1;X723ae5bb4;X99b124329;Xa6b32a41f;Xa94a1738e;Xaf653deb3;Xb6b8e5ec5;Xc52a39115;Xcc0f7dfd2;Xddfa256af;Xf36454f6f;Xf9a37d050,17,The Hyper-Cortex of Human Collective-Intelligence Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0506024,2005

This study proposes a new type of scientific contribution ranking index, ""Growing Degree of Research Area and Variance Values Index (GV-Index)"".

Statistical methods can be used to set apart the approach of an author numerically. The basic methodologies that are made use in computational stylometry are word length, sentence length, vocabulary affluence, frequencies etc. Each author has an inborn style of writing, which is particular to himself. Statistical quantitative techniques can be used to differentiate the approach of an author in a numerical way. The problem can be broken down into three sub problems as author identification, author characterization and similarity detection. The steps involved are pre-processing, extracting features, classification and author identification. For this different classifiers can be used. Here fuzzy learning classifier and SVM are used. After author identification the SVM was found to have more accuracy than Fuzzy classifier.

1053,We study the statistical properties of spectrum and eigenstates of the Google matrix of the citation network of Physical Review for the period 1893-2009. The main fraction of complex eigenvalues with largest modulus is determined numerically by different methods based on high-precision computations with up to p =16384 binary digits that allow us to resolve hard numerical problems for small eigenvalues. The nearly nilpotent matrix structure allows us to obtain a semianalytical computation of eigenvalues. We find that the spectrum is characterized by the fractal Weyl law with a fractal dimension d<SUB>f</SUB>≈1. It is found that the majority of eigenvectors are located in a localized phase.

Several data points were taken and analyzed, including web variables (page count, external links, and visits) and economic variables (total expenditures, expenditures on printed and electronic books, and physical visits). The results indicate that the variety of URL syntaxes is wide, diverse and complex, which produces a misrepresentation of academic library web resources and reduces the accuracy of web analysis. On the other hand, institutional and web data indicators are not highly correlated. Better results are obtained by correlating total library expenditures with URL mentions measured by Google (r= 0.546) and visits measured by Compete (r= 0.573), respectively. Because correlation values obtained are not highly significant, we estimate such correlations will increase if users can avoid linkage problems (due to the complexity of URLs) and gain direct access to log files (for more accurate data about visits).","Orduña-Malea, Enrique;Regazzi, John J.",ArXiv e-prints,X100da0f01;X12b72466f;X2b2544bd2;X2f15fb1b9;X6f160f5c9;X7826e96de;X931d6478d;X93979d67d;X9898ffe69;Xa1b994b71;Xa52b57caa;Xb81da85db;Xc23ee3d40;Xc2fff1b33;Xc4badbc29;Xd432f7e2f;Xd4faf1210;Xd5c036c9a;Xdcf615e47;Xe998a58d5;Xfb7bce295,21,U.S. academic libraries: understanding their web presence and their relationship with economic indicators,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5812,2013

1059,"The aggregation of web performance (page count and visibility) of internal university units could constitute a more precise indicator than the overall web performance of the universities and, therefore, be of use in the design of university web rankings. In order to test this hypothesis, a longitudinal analysis of the internal units of the Spanish university system was conducted over the course of 2010. For the 13800 URLs identified, page count and visibility was calculated using the Yahoo API. The internal values obtained were aggregated by university and compared with the values obtained from the analysis of the university general URLs. The results indicate that, although the correlations between general and internal values are high, internal performance is low in comparison to general performance, and that they give rise to different performance rankings. The conclusion is that the aggregation of unit performance is of limited use due to the low levels of internal development of the websites, and so its use is not recommended for the design of rankings. Despite this, the internal analysis enabled the detection of, amongst other things, a low correlation between page count and visibility due to the widespread use of subdirectories and problems accessing certain content.","Orduña-Malea, Enrique",ArXiv e-prints,X0ff1ec315;X310e54c99;X97da6a7fd;Xa1b994b71;Xbca0cf8e8,5,Aggregation of the web performance of internal university units as a method of quantitative analysis of a university system: the case of Spain,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5814,2013
1060,"Mention indicators have frequently been used in Webometric studies because they provide a powerful tool for determining the degree of visibility and impact of web resources. Among mention indicators, hypertextual links were a central part of many studies until Yahoo discontinued the linkdomain command in 2011. Selective links constitute a variant of external links where both the source and target of the link can be selected. This paper intends to study the influence of social platforms (measured through the number of selective external links) on academic environments, in order to ascertain both the percentage that they constitute and whether some of them can be used as substitutes of total external links. For this purpose, 141 URLs belonging to 76 Spanish universities were compiled in 2010 (before Yahoo! stopped their link services), and the number of links from 13 selected social platforms to these universities were calculated. Results confirm a good correlation between total external links and links that come from social platforms, with the exception of some applications (such as Digg and Technorati). For those universities with a higher number of total external links, the high correlation is only maintained on Delicious and Wikipedia, which can be utilized as substitutes of total external links in the context analyzed. Notwithstanding, the global percentage of links from social platforms constitute only a small fraction of total links, although a positive trend is detected, especially in services such as Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook.","Orduna-Malea, Enrique;Ontalba-Ruiperez, Jose-Antonio",ArXiv e-prints,553758d5ec;X023b98511;X16bea4631;X1d23f0a75;X21d2b9aa6;X2a62f19e3;X3af42dc84;X3db5ff619;X3e7b4987d;X502e44d6d;X628aa881c;X6bc8a2c58;X705c60ce2;X76a9e921c;X79b79a8e8;X9dfc58c26;Xa0237dd26;Xa1b994b71;Xa2dcdc02e;Xa651fe34e;Xb6f22eec1;Xc056992c6;Xc2fff1b33;Xc7c625297;Xc98db2018;Xcaaa91bca;Xcbe2f912f;Xd29b4fa71;Xe033c6179;Xf0315754f;Xf60a41ddc,31,Selective linking from social platforms to university websites: a case study of the Spanish academic system,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5815,2013
1061,"This paper presents an original way to add new data in a reference dictionary from several other lexical resources, without loosing any consistence. This operation is carried in order to get lexical information classified by the sense of the entry. This classification makes it possible to enrich utterances (in QA: the queries) following the meaning, and to reduce noise. An analysis of the experienced problems shows the interest of this method, and insists on the points that have to be tackled.","Jacquemin, Bernard",ArXiv e-prints,Xc00d1fcea;Xedf214e07,2,Dictionaries merger for text expansion in question answering,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0506046,2005
1062,"The increasing size and availability of web data make data quality a core challenge in many applications. Principles of data quality are recognized as essential to ensure that data fit for their intended use in operations, decision-making, and planning. However, with the rise of the Semantic Web, new data quality issues appear and require deeper consideration. In this paper, we propose to extend the data quality principles to the context of Semantic Web. Based on our extensive industrial experience in data integration, we identify five main classes suited for data quality in Semantic Web. For each class, we list the principles that are involved at all stages of the data management process. Following these principles will provide a sound basis for better decision-making within organizations and will maximize long-term data integration and interoperability.","Assaf, Ahmad;Senart, Aline",ArXiv e-prints,X0db0ade44;X0f8be1026;X10f7cd3cd;X12d180214;X15f1674f9;X20d49ea5d;X28b8328ac;X399a0275a;X3ffb51770;X49aa950a1;X4d7043a56;X698543ddf;X809bb5c4f;X81b92a2a0;X899b6d40a;X93341d8d1;X954792ada;X989b3eb33;Xa40ac14a5;Xa4108b9da;Xa63481831;Xb59b48a42;Xbefa65221;Xc0a9196d8;Xcb3a2ff95;Xd8b7bf28c;Xf5cd44e07;Xf6a2dc636,28,Data Quality Principles in the Semantic Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4054,2013
1063,"University rankings by fields are usually based on the research output of universities. However, research managers and rankings consumers expect to see in such fields a reflection of the structure of their own organizational institution. In this study we address such misinterpretation by developing the research profile of the organizational units of two Spanish universities: University of Granada and Pompeu Fabra University. We use two classification systems, the subject categories offered by Thomson Scientific which are commonly used on bibliometric studies, and the 37 disciplines displayed by the Spanish I-UGR Rankings which are constructed from an aggregation of the former. We also describe in detail problems encountered when working with address data from a top down approach and we show differences between universities structures derived from the interdisciplinary organizational forms of new managerialism at universities. We conclude by highlighting that rankings by fields should clearly state the methodology for the construction of such fields. We indicate that the construction of research profiles may be a good solution for universities for finding out levels of discrepancy between organizational units and subject fields.","Robinson-Garcia, Nicolas;Calero-Medina, Clara",ArXiv e-prints,X02a8cdb2f;X0ecb93762;X17f426437;X219b3f31b;X2a0ab0cf0;X58aa6a91f;X5a066ed2c;X5b7b186c5;X6030d243b;X60cd1d085;X7266221ec;X7452f44fe;X7dd5236cc;Xa1b994b71;Xb3e47aa3f;Xc34a685f3;Xcc85914e9;Xce48ce41d;Xdab998d42,19,What do university rankings by fields rank?

1064,"University online seats have gradually become complex systems of dynamic information where all their institutions and services are linked and potentially accessible. These online seats now constitute a central node around which universities construct and document their main activities and services. This information can be quantitative measured by cybermetric techniques in order to design university web rankings, taking the university as a global reference unit. However, previous research into web subunits shows that it is possible to carry out systemic web analyses, which open up the possibility of carrying out studies which address university diversity, necessary for both describing the university in greater detail and for establishing comparable ranking units. To address this issue, a multilevel university cybermetric analysis model is proposed, based on parts (core and satellite), levels (institutional and external) and sublevels (contour and internal), providing a deeper analysis of institutions. Finally the model is integrated into another which is independent of the technique used, and applied by analysing Harvard University as an example of use.","Orduña-Malea, Enrique;Ontalba-Ruipérez, José-Antonio",ArXiv e-prints,X0984b2eb2;X155e47054;X1686b76e7;X1cc0b56f5;X33d791836;X369d82a35;X37f9e605e;X38e338445;X412be29a0;X4ad30cb86;X533168997;X5f394413a;X68100b9ec;X685a64c83;X7188a8017;X7793f5670;X785816b7e;X7c65335d9;X888a329bc;X893ffdee8;X94d7548b2;X9822699d2;X9ba24f47a;Xa1b994b71;Xc2fff1b33;Xffd76bd98,26,Proposal for a multilevel university cybermetric analysis model,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5816,2013
1065,"In November 2012 the Google Scholar Metrics (GSM) journal rankings were updated, making it possible to compare bibliometric indicators in the 10 languages indexed and their stability with the April 2012 version. The h-index and h 5 median of 1000 journals were analysed, comparing their averages, maximum and minimum values and the correlation coefficient within rankings. The bibliometric figures grew significantly. In just seven and a half months the h index of the journals increased by 15% and the median h-index by 17%. This growth was observed for all the bibliometric indicators analysed and for practically every journal. However, we found significant differences in growth rates depending on the language in which the journal is published. Moreover, the journal rankings seem to be stable between April and November, reinforcing the credibility of the data held by Google Scholar and the reliability of the GSM journal rankings, despite the uncontrolled growth of Google Scholar. Based on the findings of this study we suggest, firstly, that Google should upgrade its rankings at least semiannually and, secondly, that the results should be displayed in each ranking proportionally to the number of journals indexed by language","Orduna-Malea, Enrique;Delgado Lopez-Cozar, Emilio",ArXiv e-prints,X088ffd93c;X0ab2c1388;X155e47054;X2d3fb58fa;X2f329fcb4;X5c8fa2b8c;X7fc3ddaba;Xa1b994b71;Xaf2b170fd;Xb6702720c;Xc2fff1b33;Xd073d00a5;Xdf5a1bfff;Xe85c6cb6a;Xf503532c9,15,Google Scholar Metrics evolution: an analysis according to languages,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6162,2013

Today's blogs and news sites typically invite users to express their opinions on the published content; URLs allow web resources to be shared with accompanying annotations and comments using third-party services like Twitter or Facebook.

Web Annotations are now emerging as fully independent Linked Data in their own right, no longer restricted to plain textual comments in application silos. Annotations can now range from bookmarks and comments, to fine-grained annotations of a selection of, for example, a section of a frame within a video stream. Technologies and standards now exist to create, publish, syndicate, mash-up and consume, finely targeted, semantically rich digital annotations on practically any content, as first-class Web citizens.

1067,"Using raw hyperlink counts for webometrics research has been shown to be unreliable and researchers have looked for alternatives. One alternative is classifying hyperlinks in a website based on the motivation behind the hyperlink creation. The method used for this type of classification involves manually visiting a webpage and then classifying individual links on the webpage. This is time consuming, making it infeasible for large scale studies. This paper speeds up the classification of hyperlinks in UK academic websites by using a machine learning technique, decision tree induction, to group web pages found in UK academic websites into one of eight categories and then infer the motivation for the creation of a hyperlink in a webpage based on the linking pattern of the category the webpage belongs to.","Kenekayoro, Patrick;Buckley, Kevan;Thelwall, Mike",ArXiv e-prints,X000749179;X0accffd94;X0ad9d410a;X0caad1226;X15633c35d;X2337e994c;X36e664988;X3d01457b7;X431c29950;X489a1f39b;X4d7a850fd;X4f872f328;X94b0fdd97;Xa5c1cbfce;Xb8dd72620;Xc2fff1b33,16,Motivation for hyperlink creation using inter-page relationships,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1082,2013

We demonstrate the behavior of the metric using examples from an application over LOD.

1071,"In an article in the pages of this journal five years ago, we described a method for predicting which scientific papers will be highly cited in the future, even if they are currently not highly cited. Applying the method to real citation data we made predictions about papers we believed would end up being well cited. Here we revisit those predictions, five years on, to see how well we did. Among the over 2000 papers in our original data set, we examine the fifty that, by the measures of our previous study, were predicted to do best and we find that they have indeed received substantially more citations in the intervening years than other papers, even after controlling for the number of prior citations. On average these top fifty papers have received 23 times as many citations in the last five years as the average paper in the data set as a whole, and 15 times as many as the average paper in a randomly drawn control group that started out with the same number of citations. Applying our prediction technique to current data, we also make new predictions of papers that we believe will be well cited in the next few years.","Newman, M. E.

1072,"We analyze international co-authorship relations in the Social Science Citation Index 2011 using all citable items in the DVD-version of this index. Network statistics indicate four groups of nations: (i) an Asian-Pacific one to which all Anglo-Saxon nations (including the UK and Ireland) are attributed; (ii) a continental European one including also the Latin-American countries; (iii) the Scandinavian nations; and (iv) a community of African nations. Within the EU-28 (including Croatia), eleven of the EU-15 states have dominant positions. Collapsing the EU-28 into a single node leads to a bi-polar structure between the US and EU-28; China is part of the US-pole. We develop an information-theoretical test to distinguish whether international collaborations or domestic collaborations prevail; the results are mixed, but the international dimension is more important than the national one in the aggregated sets (this was found in both SSCI and SCI). In France, however, the national distribution is more important than the international one, while the reverse is true for most European nations in the core group (UK, Germany, the Netherlands, etc.). Decomposition of the USA in terms of states shows a similarly mixed result; more US states are domestically oriented in SSCI, whereas more internationally in SCI.

Along with traditional metrics of research quality, such as citation counts, online images of researchers and institutions increasingly matter in evaluating academic impact, decisions about grant allocation, and promotion. We examined 400 biographical Wikipedia articles on academics from four scientific fields to test if being featured in the world's largest online encyclopedia is correlated with higher academic notability (assessed through citation counts). We found no statistically significant correlation between Wikipedia articles metrics (length, number of edits, number of incoming links from other articles, etc.) and academic notability of the mentioned researchers. We also did not find any evidence that the scientists with better WP representation are necessarily more prominent in their fields. In addition, we inspected the Wikipedia coverage of notable scientists sampled from Thomson Reuters list of ""highly cited researchers"". In each of the examined fields, Wikipedia failed in covering notable scholars properly. Both findings imply that Wikipedia might be producing an inaccurate image of academics on the front end of science.

The quantifiable scientometric changes during the last decade, however, suggest that many areas of knowledge are evolving in the opposite direction. Despite an increase during the last decade of the numbers of journals and academic articles published, increases in the number of citations the published articles receive, and increases in the number of countries participating; important parts of the academic activity are becoming more nationalistic. In addition, international collaboration is decreasing in several subject areas, and in several geographic regions. For example, countries in Asia are becoming scientifically more isolated; and academics working in the humanities in all the regions of the world are very nationalistic and are becoming more so. The precise consequences of this dynamics are difficult to predict, but it certainly will have reverberations beyond academia. The tendency of the humanities to become more provincial will certainly not help in reducing international conflicts arising from poor understanding of cultural differences and of diverging sociopolitical world views. More and better data on these trends should give us a better understanding for eventually improving academic policies worldwide.

1081,"Background Semantic Web Technology (SWT) makes it possible to integrate and search the large volume of life science datasets in the public domain, as demonstrated by well-known linked data projects such as LODD, Bio2RDF, and Chem2Bio2RDF. Integration of these sets creates large networks of information. We have previously described a tool called WENDI for aggregating information pertaining to new chemical compounds, effectively creating evidence paths relating the compounds to genes, diseases and so on. In this paper we examine the utility of automatically inferring new compound-disease associations (and thus new links in the network) based on semantically marked-up versions of these evidence paths, rule-sets and inference engines. Results Through the implementation of a semantic inference algorithm, rule set, Semantic Web methods (RDF, OWL and SPARQL) and new interfaces, we have created a new tool called Chemogenomic Explorer that uses networks of ontologically annotated RDF statements along with deductive reasoning tools to infer new associations between the query structure and genes and diseases from WENDI results. The tool then permits interactive clustering and filtering of these evidence paths. Conclusions We present a new aggregate approach to inferring links between chemical compounds and diseases using semantic inference. This approach allows multiple evidence paths between compounds and diseases to be identified using a rule-set and semantically annotated data, and for these evidence paths to be clustered to show overall evidence linking the compound to a disease. We believe this is a powerful approach, because it allows compound-disease relationships to be ranked by the amount of evidence supporting them.","Zhu, Qian;Sun, Yuyin;Challa, Sashikiran;Ding, Ying;Lajiness, Michael S.;Wild, David J.",ArXiv e-prints,Xa1b994b71;Xa8f8ba34c;Xc056992c6;Xd5de08a96;Xfe95ed30b,5,Semantic Inference using Chemogenomics Data for Drug Discovery,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4880,2011

Problems have often been noted, and alternatives proposed, but the journal system still survives. In this article I focus on problems relating to reliance on subject-specific journals and peer review. Contrary to what is often assumed, there are alternatives to the current system, some of which have only becoming viable since the rise of the world wide web. The market for academic ideas should be opened up by separating the publication service from the review service: the former would ideally be served by an open access, web-based repository system encompassing all disciplines, whereas the latter should be opened up to encourage non-peer reviews from different perspectives, user reviews, statistics reviews, reviews from the perspective of different disciplines, and so on. The possibility of multiple reviews of the same artefact should encourage competition between reviewing organizations and should make the system more responsive to the requirements of the differing audience groups.

1087,"In a previews paper we introduced the quantitative method named Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS). With this method one can determine the historical roots of research fields and quantify their impact on current research. RPYS is based on the analysis of the frequency with which references are cited in the publications of a specific research field in terms of the publication years of these cited references. In this study, we illustrate that RPYS can also be used to reveal the origin of scientific legends. We selected Darwin finches as an example for illustration. Charles Darwin, the originator of evolutionary theory, was given credit for finches he did not see and for observations and insights about the finches he never made. We have shown that a book published in 1947 is the most-highly cited early reference cited within the relevant literature. This book had already been revealed as the origin of the term Darwin finches by Sulloway through careful historical analysis.","Marx, Werner;Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X38662ba64;X51b66769f;X5cf6a8d6b;X8578192e3;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xd9f76e20c;Xebd8eb3d6;Xf934c2f31;Xfb00c2a0b,10,Tracing the origin of a scientific legend by Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS): the legend of the Darwin finches,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5665,2013
1088,"Here we describe the SHARE system, a web service based framework for distributed querying and reasoning on the semantic web. The main innovations of SHARE are: (1) the extension of a SPARQL query engine to perform on-demand data retrieval from web services, and (2) the extension of an OWL reasoner to test property restrictions by means of web service invocations. In addition to enabling queries across distributed datasets, the system allows for a target dataset that is significantly larger than is possible under current, centralized approaches. Although the architecture is equally applicable to all types of data, the SHARE system targets bioinformatics, due to the large number of interoperable web services that are already available in this area. SHARE is built entirely on semantic web standards, and is the successor of the BioMOBY project.","Vandervalk, Ben P;McCarthy, E Luke;Wilkinson, Mark D",ArXiv e-prints,X0cc924690;Xa69ee2152;Xde65f93aa;Xf9e718125,4,SHARE: A Web Service Based Framework for Distributed Querying and Reasoning on the Semantic Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4455,2013
1089,"Commons based peer-production (CBPP) is the de-centralized, net-based approach to the creation and dissemination of information resources. Underlying every CBPP system is a virtual community brought together by an internet tool (such as a web site) and structured by a specific collaboration protocol. In this talk we will argue that the value of such platforms can be leveraged by adapting them for pedagogical purposes. We report on one such recent adaptation. The Noosphere system is a web-based collaboration environment that underlies the popular Planetmath website, a collaboratively written encyclopedia of mathematics licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (FDL). Recently, the system was used to host a graduate-level mathematics course at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Canada. The course consisted of regular lectures and assignment problems. The students in the course collaborated on a set of course notes, encapsulating the lecture content and giving solutions of assigned problems. The successful outcome of this experiment demonstrated that a dedicated Noosphere system is well suited for classroom applications. We argue that this ``proof of concept'' experience also strongly suggests that every successful CBPP platform possesses latent pedagogical value.","Milson, Robert;Krowne, Aaron",ArXiv e-prints,X471cd1b1e;X4a9610308;X702380336;X76ce6906c;Xb7b94c623;Xf89da9a14;Xfa2ae1918,7,Adapting CBPP platforms for instructional use,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0507028,2005
1090,"An original cross sectional dataset referring to a medium sized Italian university is implemented in order to analyze the determinants of scientific research production at individual level. The dataset includes 942 permanent researchers of various scientific sectors for a three year time span (2008 - 2010). Three different indicators - based on the number of publications or citations - are considered as response variables. The corresponding distributions are highly skewed and display an excess of zero - valued observations. In this setting, the goodness of fit of several Poisson mixture regression models are explored by assuming an extensive set of explanatory variables. As to the personal observable characteristics of the researchers, the results emphasize the age effect and the gender productivity gap, as previously documented by existing studies. Analogously, the analysis confirm that productivity is strongly affected by the publication and citation practices adopted in different scientific disciplines. The empirical evidence on the connection between teaching and research activities suggests that no univocal substitution or complementarity thesis can be claimed: a major teaching load does not affect the odds to be a non-active researcher and does not significantly reduce the number of publications for active researchers. In addition, new evidence emerges on the effect of researchers administrative tasks, which seem to be negatively related with researcher's productivity, and on the composition of departments. Researchers' productivity is apparently enhanced by operating in department filled with more administrative and technical staff, and it is not significantly affected by the composition of the department in terms of senior or junior researchers.","Baccini, Alberto;Barabesi, Lucio;Cioni, Martina;Pisani, Caterina",ArXiv e-prints,X080e7479a;X24d6a2daa;X265ac83d9;X3e496e278;X3f148e508;X41e6d2884;X42742c846;X4879ac23e;X4ced60cbc;X699701435;X758ab8e40;X778ccc760;X788e52910;X7c0b1d2f3;X856f3f430;X902cb7769;X9cfc4317d;Xa1b994b71;Xae5ed683e;Xafc6a0eb6;Xb1908bdc2;Xb326e34e6;Xb50e05f0b;Xb9445cd90;Xbc0bb839a;Xbe9720784;Xbf26fe88c;Xd22bb8342;Xdb96b25a4;Xe52246072;Xf375725c2;Xf612f189a;Xfa277918d;Xfd3cccaec,34,Crossing the hurdle: the determinants of individual scientific performance,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0084,2013
1091,"Problems for evaluation and impact of published scientific works and their authors are discussed. The role of citations in this process is pointed out. Different bibliometric indicators are reviewed in this connection and ways for generation of new bibliometric indices are given. The influence of different circumstances, like self-citations, number of authors, time dependence and publication types, on the evaluation and impact of scientific papers are considered. The repercussion of works citations and their content is investigated in this respect. Attention is paid also on implicit citations which are not covered by the modern bibliometrics but often are reflected in the peer reviews. Some aspects of the Web analogues of citations and new possibilities of the Internet resources in evaluating authors achievements are presented.","Iliev, Bozhidar Z.",ArXiv e-prints,X10a71e5f0;X3c165a3c5;X414ea462b;X58560aba1;X6772d5ca1;X7af035591;X8c7942a63;Xc2fff1b33;Xeecfffe2d;Xef54965b0;Xf15c81595;Xf220a42f7,12,Measuring the evaluation and impact of scientific works and their authors,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6948,2013
1092,"Annotations allow users to associate additional information with existing resources. Using proprietary and closed systems on the Web, users are already able to annotate multimedia resources such as images, audio and video. So far, however, this information is almost always kept locked up and inaccessible to the Web of Data. We believe that an important step to take is the integration of multimedia annotations and the Linked Data principles. This should allow clients to easily publish and consume, thus exchange annotations about resources via common Web standards. We first present the current status of the Open Annotation Collaboration, an international initiative that is currently working on annotation interoperability specifications based on best practices from the Linked Data effort. Then we present two use cases and early prototypes that make use of the proposed annotation model and present lessons learned and discuss yet open technical issues.","Haslhofer, Bernhard;Simon, Rainer;Sanderson, Robert;van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X07a13f5c0;X174fae95b;X271f5f64a;X4082b8ee5;X4f7906448;X5de64b05e;X6f551fa37;X715cafb12;X785816b7e;X7b57f885c;X8a330ab47;X9f030c9b6;Xae71ab32a;Xba0c7d846;Xc3dd59074;Xca9f6d430;Xe201ef00e;Xe4e0d031c;Xe7494b36c;Xea583ffe9;Xf0dde73f2,21,The Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC) Model,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5178,2011
1093,"Developing ontologies can be expensive, time-consuming, as well as difficult to develop and maintain. This is especially true for more expressive and/or larger ontologies. Some ontologies are, however, relatively repetitive, reusing design patterns; building these with both generic and bespoke patterns should reduce duplication and increase regularity which in turn should impact on the cost of development. Here we report on the usage of patterns applied to two biomedical ontologies: firstly a novel ontology for karyotypes which has been built ground-up using a pattern based approach; and, secondly, our initial refactoring of the SIO ontology to make explicit use of patterns at development time. To enable this, we use the Tawny-OWL library which enables full-programmatic development of ontologies. We show how this approach can generate large numbers of classes from much simpler data structures which is highly beneficial within biomedical ontology engineering.","Warrender, Jennifer D.;Lord, Phillip",ArXiv e-prints,X004d95382;X012fb8fc8;X2337e994c;X25a507a59;X43a9718d2;X4789429a4;X4b9b7cb6c;X7d676506a;X9bb7c43b7;Xa1909a654;Xc2fff1b33;Xe60ce9b4a;Xf7e1ba992,13,A pattern-driven approach to biomedical ontology engineering,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0465,2013
1094,"This article analyzes one month of edits to Wikipedia in order to examine the role of users editing multiple language editions (referred to as multilingual users). Such multilingual users may serve an important function in diffusing information across different language editions of the encyclopedia, and prior work has suggested this could reduce the level of self-focus bias in each edition. This study finds multilingual users are much more active than their single-edition (monolingual) counterparts. They are found in all language editions, but smaller-sized editions with fewer users have a higher percentage of multilingual users than larger-sized editions. About a quarter of multilingual users always edit the same articles in multiple languages, while just over 40% of multilingual users edit different articles in different languages. When non-English users do edit a second language edition, that edition is most frequently English. Nonetheless, several regional and linguistic cross-editing patterns are also present.","Hale, Scott A.",ArXiv e-prints,X00c65ba43;X013fe3298;X05c5d4d26;X073ef18dc;X098ddb78a;X0ebe0e151;X10843800b;X1110f6ddc;X1370a3a90;X14c275f80;X1ceb350ec;X1d90e9973;X1e79150a2;X1ebca118a;X1fc12d652;X2337e994c;X23fcfb1a3;X24f44e0f4;X26c9ee23c;X28ba71b1e;X29dc52530;X2b1e2683c;X2b543f738;X2d36f129d;X2dc0798ee;X2eef89535;X315cb814c;X3afd2f966;X3b610fdc7;X3ff1d83df;X4157e801c;X427e413ef;X4773b987b;X47acee1e3;X47cfe7deb;X4ee76b642;X4ff79da36;X507dad59b;X518b80d01;X567bdbe38;X57e6720b2;X57f1c00f1;X589fda3ef;X59a7e32f2;X5cac35c16;X6104b91f0;X63d8fd85d;X650e7245d;X678551f04;X699701435;X6a5f4663f;X6bcf92cce;X6df1ff37e;X6ea0208c4;X72fb80088;X73146d65f;X7369a29a5;X7a1a1c156;X7ba9f717f;X7e8b4d08f;X8151f7b27;X828d66a70;X82eca1f24;X84015409e;X858cf1adf;X85b70f60e;X86c487c6e;X87872f3ee;X8acdd3143;X8c1b2ba5d;X902581c13;X90c856526;X91c02e1cc;X92f2197e0;X94b6d8b85;X9536c0ce0;X9b39d287a;X9ea3de701;X9f6cb8038;X9ff9667d8;Xa14f38f4b;Xa2043b2dc;Xa66e77803;Xab2372853;Xab760effb;Xaba9c8d56;Xabcd838c1;Xb3eb32fe7;Xb4ee984cf;Xb8435f42d;Xb942760e9;Xbc13da3e8;Xbcaeb8aea;Xbf26fe88c;Xc1bf16e44;Xc3272cfb0;Xc55818984;Xc5635a29d;Xc6c7acf99;Xc8d1c251c;Xca3525a1f;Xcf87367d7;Xd0c88690d;Xd50d3c1d7;Xd54acce0b;Xd796dc900;Xd90e19dd8;Xda94162b6;Xdbf3fd191;Xdbf908613;Xdee670c75;Xe04c87cb6;Xe110fbee3;Xe261277c8;Xe43983d3f;Xe8c4f9a71;Xe9ccdd976;Xeb46069de;Xf01c24eab;Xf1b0abc16;Xf1c52c1a6;Xf1d2b6493;Xf52d48083;Xf7c5fbaf8;Xf957f541d;Xfca713cf6;Xfd2930aef,127,Multilinguals and Wikipedia Editing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0976,2013

1098,"Rankings of scholarly journals based on citation data are often met with skepticism by the scientific community. Part of the skepticism is due to disparity between the common perception of journals' prestige and their ranking based on citation counts. A more serious concern is the inappropriate use of journal rankings to evaluate the scientific influence of authors. This paper focuses on analysis of the table of cross-citations among a selection of Statistics journals. Data are collected from the Web of Science database published by Thomson Reuters. Our results suggest that modelling the exchange of citations between journals is useful to highlight the most prestigious journals, but also that journal citation data are characterized by considerable heterogeneity, which needs to be properly summarized. Inferential conclusions require care in order to avoid potential over-interpretation of insignificant differences between journal ratings. Comparison with published ratings of institutions from the UK's Research Assessment Exercise shows strong correlation at aggregate level between assessed research quality and journal citation `export scores' within the discipline of Statistics.","Varin, Cristiano;Cattelan, Manuela;Firth, David",ArXiv e-prints,X02dd65409;X044b9cdf2;X04c1b206b;X0529b79f8;X05c7eccf6;X0770cc604;X0778a52b0;X07c5a3f21;X093cd67a1;X0948d85e7;X0a8ebc16f;X0ac4f9d5f;X0bae228da;X0ce30afcb;X0e588d802;X0ebd3e64d;X0f0721527;X0f0a53d3a;X0f4aec86d;X0f8764673;X0f8add330;X10b8a7c49;X110f8daaf;X11b702272;X12689da4c;X1324562f5;X136d9bfb0;X14b497eb6;X15c64d2ae;X16a6432e0;X187682fa5;X18aeebca9;X19fe12772;X1ac634cdc;X1d2d82e2d;X1d818d43c;X1d90e9973;X1f068d852;X1f4275b6d;X1f9dadc9b;X1fed20080;X20bacf270;X2196a6117;X21d9c658e;X225b91ad8;X2353fada6;X23fbdf352;X2407e9565;X25bf1d11e;X262da9b8c;X268d30cc4;X26bca6eb5;X2812e566f;X289afc27e;X28bf681f9;X2920aeabd;X299448bfa;X2a898e712;X2aa1d65c3;X2b5995646;X2b86af502;X2ca060ff6;X2cb0faf8c;X2cd544158;X2d3bdab40;X2d5ac6208;X2dc5952bc;X2fef4bc54;X3136b762b;X31cafe2d1;X341d2fc58;X35aaaa567;X35f0dd122;X38892ddb3;X3a01366b1;X3a3db597d;X3afdd93dc;X3d3ad9b79;X3d5f09d03;X3e7846e19;X3f148e508;X40ff5543c;X422656487;X434a0c77a;X44d37dbd2;X4709aa7a6;X476a0096f;X47b7d00b0;X487e178bf;X48ba5343f;X4a57b312e;X4b616c94c;X4b6cb1b84;X4baded121;X4df1b8d63;X4e0c70561;X4e7ac1334;X4edb60c42;X5105925af;X52c7d8143;X532f8c982;X53f1eb4a7;X5491ce455;X55534732b;X55ba6ce6b;X55c179c7e;X57078063d;X58560aba1;X58cf287b8;X596114eb3;X59b160134;X5ba6ebd76;X5c8fa2b8c;X5e8c33898;X6271c40b7;X62f2877f9;X64c9a1296;X66711c8dd;X68aea1508;X68b35720a;X6afe8aab7;X6b3a014ed;X6b68075cd;X6bc661b0d;X6d456b24f;X6d6fc2c93;X6eeaee726;X6f2f1b2e7;X6fe0895df;X70893269d;X716631f58;X71e274a26;X722ea5d03;X73a9b8c7a;X779ccdf4b;X77d802017;X785262942;X795fe1346;X79af85719;X7c0b1d2f3;X800235629;X8017aa306;X806183cda;X808d37a53;X82f7b857c;X846d158d4;X86e30707b;X8700f7949;X88626631e;X888561f47;X88e905724;X88fbf066b;X8a61bab63;X8eb67069c;X8f301427d;X91769129c;X9177e04ab;X9226bc074;X9295bda83;X959950a9b;X961bc9e45;X96a2cd00d;X97cb79349;X9854b74f9;X9894090bc;X997995ab4;X9b634c406;X9bdcd535a;X9c792c79e;X9d429516e;X9d7a7d049;X9e36d65fa;X9e60d376a;X9e656827c;X9f38582f7;Xa1c919eed;Xa2f1b1547;Xa5919f569;Xa5cb25a60;Xa67f5e3ff;Xa6e5d0e46;Xa7163075d;Xa779d1333;Xa7b82c8ce;Xa91c6c877;Xa957429d0;Xaa1314841;Xaa19d4690;Xab01a1fa1;Xabeaf8753;Xac8fde447;Xad1aabbc6;Xad2c0d619;Xada285eb1;Xadadce91f;Xadbb0e512;Xae3338dcf;Xb117e0130;Xb1446e69e;Xb1848277c;Xb405ec81d;Xb47400c36;Xb50e05f0b;Xb5551c8d9;Xb6b3fe667;Xb7a461c08;Xbc197fe11;Xbc28db918;Xbddc4b676;Xbe7e8e94e;Xbf4f5b790;Xbf8d07581;Xc04da5057;Xc0b3d2b5e;Xc13331a39;Xc13b1dbf0;Xc1c6b5b69;Xc3013c02c;Xc519ccca9;Xc57aae3b9;Xc6e330e08;Xc7ac3242c;Xc82959276;Xca78a1bb3;Xca7a024fa;Xcbfcd6fd7;Xccab4b6db;Xcdb040b3d;Xce111f38c;Xcefe9d1d0;Xcf000300c;Xcfa8f4ae9;Xd0748ee9f;Xd1c3114ed;Xd3f86c2bb;Xd5f07fc62;Xd69ac6b05;Xd711e8bda;Xd75689d3b;Xd7ee0ac1d;Xd831b6f7e;Xd884298bb;Xd8d0f7a1a;Xd97ffcbcc;Xd9e9ad0b3;Xdae9ce17e;Xdb385d669;Xdb8bf9550;Xdba4a652b;Xdd38496ba;Xdda34c9ad;Xddf73d391;Xde4d7ff5d;Xdec750d84;Xdf2ac53aa;Xdf4f95aae;Xdf6d70644;Xe120d04b4;Xe40645a1e;Xe469f295b;Xe59d468d5;Xe5ec9c853;Xe68c48b6f;Xe71ee7d8d;Xe76c6c830;Xe9329ef4a;Xeb398c736;Xec64f4938;Xef004ff3a;Xef7922054;Xf25cbabf5;Xf2d41d841;Xf36cfb04b;Xf3aa3a223;Xf4e21d2a7;Xf558ac7de;Xf58364b55;Xf70b24775;Xf70c7760f;Xf72ed88d8;Xf7f0cba6f;Xf8477f805;Xf870b0782;Xf89e96c1b;Xf8defb714;Xf981b71f2;Xf99f19ed3;Xfc74c0ffe;Xfecd957d5;Xfee5d57f4;Xfffbb59cf,291,Statistical Modelling of Citation Exchange Between Statistics Journals,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1794,2013

1101,"The impact factor (IF) of scientific journals has acquired a major role in the evaluations of the output of scholars, departments and whole institutions. Typically papers appearing in journals with large values of the IF receive a high weight in such evaluations. However, at the end of the day one is interested in assessing the impact of individuals, rather than papers. Here we introduce Author Impact Factor (AIF), which is the extension of the IF to authors. The AIF of an author A in year t is the average number of citations given by papers published in year t to papers published by A in a period of Δt years before year t. Due to its intrinsic dynamic character, AIF is capable to capture trends and variations of the impact of the scientific output of scholars in time, unlike the h-index, which is a growing measure taking into account the whole career path.","Pan, Raj Kumar;Fortunato, Santo",Scientific Reports,X027fd45a1;X11d196657;X14df8ad8f;X186b5e696;X1d90e9973;X1f845bf62;X2c586a944;X34e8a4a9f;X3c8f208c6;X42b7256c8;X432708577;X4788a0bec;X6e5ab6ef7;X707e972fc;X7188a8017;X73b352c53;X7a2b2414c;X823476766;X8290ea499;X85d09828e;X8f2b7fd9b;X94a3a57d8;X9529efed8;X9ecb4b99b;Xa81c010d7;Xa8524c739;Xaf95f0a06;Xb1cc0a94c;Xc34c41297;Xd53e22e52;Xda7b7c045;Xdcc82a970;Xe4373cc9b;Xe87b389da;Xe900aa7a2;Xf4cfc6483;Xfabac9b2d,37,Author Impact Factor: tracking the dynamics of individual scientific impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2650,2014
1102,"Purpose: The aim of this study is to analyze the disciplinary coverage of the Thomson Reuters' Book Citation Index database focusing on publisher presence, impact and specialization. Design/Methodology/approach: We conduct a descriptive study in which we examine coverage by discipline, publisher distribution by field and country of publication, and publisher impact. For this the Thomson Reuters' Subject Categories were aggregated into 15 disciplines. Findings: 30% of the total share of this database belongs to the fields of Humanities and Social Sciences. Most of the disciplines are covered by very few publishers mainly from the UK and USA (75.05% of the books), in fact 33 publishers concentrate 90% of the whole share. Regarding publisher impact, 80.5% of the books and chapters remained uncited. Two serious errors were found in this database. Firstly, the Book Citation Index does not retrieve all citations for books and chapters. Secondly, book citations do not include citations to their chapters. Research limitations/implications: The Book Citation Index is still underdeveloped and has serious limitations which call into caution when using it for bibliometric purposes. Practical implications: The results obtained from this study warn against the use of this database for bibliometric purposes, but opens a new window of opportunities for covering long neglected areas such as Humanities and Social Sciences. The target audience of this study is librarians, bibliometricians, researchers, scientific publishers, prospective authors and evaluation agencies. Originality/Value: There are currently no studies analyzing in depth the coverage of this novel database which covers monographs.","Torres-Salinas, Daniel;Robinson-García, Nicolás;Campanario, J.

1103,"Numerical physics has gained a lot of importance in the last decade, its efficiency being motivated and sustained by the growth of computational power. This paper presents a concept that is to be developed in the next few years: OpenPh. OpenPh is a numerical physics library that makes use of the advantages of both open source software and MATLAB programming. Its aim is to deliver the instruments for providing numerical and graphical solutions for various physics problems. It has a modular structure, allowing the user to add new modules to the existing ones and to create its own modules according to its needs, being virtually unlimited extendable. The modules of OpenPh are implemented using MATLAB engine because it is the best solution used in engineering and science, providing a wide range of optimized methods to accomplish even the toughest jobs. Current version of OpenPh includes two modules, the first one providing tools for quantum physics and the second one for mechanics. The quantum physics module deals with the photoelectric effect, the radioactive decay of carbon-11, and the Schr\""odinger equation - particle in a box. The classical mechanics module includes the study of the uniform circular motion, the forced damped harmonic oscillations and the vibration of a fixed-fixed string.","Milescu, George;Noaje, Gabriel;Pop, Florin",ArXiv e-prints,X19c55109b;X1c230ce67;X1f6242644;X2ec6d36dd;X34698f424;X3e49dd65c;X40cd34c42;X4731a116d;X48778e5a5;X4cc63e7be;X4cf92ee43;X4dbd93dd4;X50dd592a0;X51afb381f;X5752b2e52;X6b0b417c0;X70a0deecf;X84c9274c8;X867ef8243;X87429e357;X88589df95;X8a12d959e;X8cd47a5cd;X8dc88e831;X8e1a269bc;X8ecf44a7c;X977f11868;Xa11ec03ff;Xa4bc7a768;Xa8672364f;Xac9797930;Xb0ba28ac5;Xbb5afd4bb;Xc0027d24d;Xc48d780ac;Xc680c40a2;Xd393bda69;Xd4412ea87;Xd559b1da2;Xdb3f5fe60;Xf585d7c9f;Xf6ff80291;Xfa664843e;Xfc9ef5a48;Xfe2d0f748;Xffcee9488,46,OpenPh - Numerical Physics Library,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5304,2011

1105,"Did the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 influence the scientific performance of the researchers in Eastern European countries? Did this historical event affect international collaboration by researchers from the Eastern European countries with those of Western countries? Did it also change international collaboration among researchers from the Eastern European countries? Trying to answer these questions, this study aims to shed light on international collaboration by researchers from the Eastern European countries (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia). The number of publications and normalized citation impact values are compared for these countries based on InCites (Thomson Reuters), from 1981 up to 2011. The international collaboration by researchers affiliated to institutions in Eastern European countries at the time points of 1990, 2000 and 2011 was studied with the help of Pajek and VOSviewer software, based on data from the Science Citation Index (Thomson Reuters). Our results show that the breakdown of the communist regime did not lead, on average, to a huge improvement in the publication performance of the Eastern European countries and that the increase in international co-authorship relations by the researchers affiliated to institutions in these countries was smaller than expected. Most of the Eastern European countries are still subject to changes and are still awaiting their boost in scientific development.","Kozak, Marcin;Bornmann, Lutz;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X00557c80b;X03a364eb9;X0b95423c3;X1c789dfe2;X1d454ae6d;X22471e7f2;X2337e994c;X24143aae5;X260b05fb2;X2f94f1d4f;X4107b4094;X471cec2b1;X4d3bbdeba;X4f4edbdda;X53ffaca1c;X55a9d8643;X560261551;X578ba6fe7;X58af8d9a6;X5f2ead0b6;X669479c37;X7126c3bad;X74543499f;X85cf81a21;X88d73b5c4;X88e98c380;X908ee17c9;X95994b5b1;X9e7100ee7;Xa07d46902;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa80be143d;Xb6471f464;Xb65cc8862;Xb76cecd2d;Xb78635123;Xb899a4f01;Xb903f0e80;Xbe111031f;Xbe4e39122;Xd01b721ec;Xde4689801;Xe4483adf2;Xf35508cd0,44,How have the Eastern European countries of the former Warsaw Pact developed since 1990?

1107,"The interdisciplinary nature of the Semantic Web and the many projects put forward by the community led to a large number of widely accepted serialization formats for RDF. Most of these RDF syntaxes have been developed out of a necessity to serve specific purposes better than existing ones, e.g. RDFa was proposed as an extension to HTML for embedding non-intrusive RDF statements in human-readable documents. Nonetheless, the RDF serialization formats are generally transducible among themselves given that they are commonly based on the RDF model. In this paper, we present (1) a RESTful Web service based on the HTTP protocol that translates between different serializations. In addition to its core functionality, our proposed solution provides (2) features to accommodate frequent needs of Semantic Web developers, namely a straightforward user interface with copy-to-clipboard functionality, syntax highlighting, persistent URI links for easy sharing, cool URI patterns, and content negotiation using respective HTTP headers.

Additionally, this paper introduces the semantic annotation categories, tools, domains and models.","Slimani, Thabet",ArXiv e-prints,X04effcad4;X120311456;X1581201de;X1772843f7;X1f45b3525;X262ef7a99;X2870b48f6;X2a865a1c4;X2ebe8acff;X3465d538a;X38d7ec833;X390d78673;X3a4b6ae20;X3e5ee72ad;X4867a6bd6;X50105940b;X571a297c1;X6179ab48c;X67012befb;X6adcb98bd;X73e12e0ea;X7793f5670;X7bd0dccd6;X899b6d40a;X8b45a7ce6;X8c446fdca;X8f4abe591;X8f5817480;X945d5fcbd;X997ac9a06;Xa2217b176;Xa574d53b2;Xa778f07a4;Xa85019adc;Xa91596a6e;Xaf96aa740;Xc0b6a9efe;Xd4f954db7;Xd5635eb56;Xdad7d65d5;Xe713af8f2;Xe735926ab;Xecd4fa3e7;Xeec62e54f;Xf07c5401e;Xf7d663ab7;Xf8efde907;Xfa4fec0cb,48,Semantic Annotation: The Mainstay of Semantic Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4794,2013
1109,"This study analyzed references and source papers of the Proceedings of 2009-2012 International Conference of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities (DADH), which was held annually in Taiwan. A total of 59 sources and 1,104 references were investigated, based on descriptive analysis and subject analysis of library practices on cataloguing. Preliminary results showed historical materials, events, bureaucracies, and people of Taiwan and China in the Qing Dynasty were the major subjects in the tempo-spatial dimensions. The subject-date figure depicted a long-low head and short-high tail curve, which demonstrated both characteristics of research of humanities and application of technology in digital humanities. The dates of publication of the references spanned over 360 years, which shows a long time span in research materials. A majority of the papers (61.41%) were single-authored, which is in line with the common research practice in the humanities. Books published by general publishers were the major type of references, and this was the same as that of established humanities research. The next step of this study will focus on the comparison of characteristics of both sources and references of international journals with those reported in this article.","Chen, Kuang-hua;Hsueh, Bi-Shin",ArXiv e-prints,X07e1b519c;X3ec6a4282;X667b3eba2;X78bae0d34;X992e4a4c0;Xbbe5de7f1;Xc30c518e6;Xce6017eaf;Xd6322f1f5;Xdcc92795b;Xde2e058db;Xe2f4fe3b8;Xf3299d5a6,13,Exploring Regional Development of Digital Humanities Research: A Case Study for Taiwan,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5817,2013
1110,"Policies ensuring that research data are available on public archives are increasingly being implemented at the government [1], funding agency [2-4], and journal [5,6] level. These policies are predicated on the idea that authors are poor stewards of their data, particularly over the long term [7], and indeed many studies have found that authors are often unable or unwilling to share their data [8-11]. However, there are no systematic estimates of how the availability of research data changes with time since publication. We therefore requested datasets from a relatively homogenous set of 516 articles published between 2 and 22 years ago, and found that availability of the data was strongly affected by article age. For papers where the authors gave the status of their data, the odds of a dataset being extant fell by 17% per year. In addition, the odds that we could find a working email address for the first, last or corresponding author fell by 7% per year. Our results reinforce the notion that, in the long term, research data cannot be reliably preserved by individual researchers, and further demonstrate the urgent need for policies mandating data sharing via public archives.","Vines, Timothy;Albert, Arianne;Andrew, Rose;Debarré, Florence;Bock, Dan;Franklin, Michelle;Gilbert, Kimberley;Moore, Jean-Sébastien;Renaut, Sébastien;Rennison, Diana J.",ArXiv e-prints,X02b92c277;X03268f2c0;X041593b2e;X055ebb3ab;X08c29f4c5;X0d9667280;X0fac0db83;X0ff6e6c0f;X1125e0f1b;X112f39c4d;X13225656e;X13f789a8f;X14f635adc;X17442ff94;X1955917ca;X1e19adb65;X210f2be75;X211feb3c4;X21c009a09;X238fcb6ed;X23973d830;X23eaed190;X2494202ef;X25e4a5841;X26973d703;X29350994e;X2c8dabc5f;X371fd3695;X3a9d81fad;X3af42dc84;X3b6041b44;X3c2ddb7be;X3f5898d72;X4672cc01e;X482c27141;X4d19fba47;X4fd2b5406;X51103e090;X5474d776e;X563d992d9;X56a36cc29;X5a0f6b17f;X5b2c3cb61;X5c3afffd4;X61b4c1c9a;X6226d0e25;X62f355fe3;X632cf746f;X637e90caa;X68100b9ec;X697f36432;X6aa1af2f7;X6e247b3a5;X6e915df65;X71d6ae955;X72ede7437;X79b79a8e8;X7bd5fbc90;X7ce8fa4bb;X7fc3ddaba;X863862ddb;X890a12db2;X9144a84be;X96110ce0c;X97b2fe9e6;Xa34f49d57;Xa5932fcc9;Xa616afcff;Xa640ee6d1;Xac7d17919;Xae27dc5ae;Xb12d45b4e;Xb4f263f02;Xb9a3b75b0;Xba6b39ce3;Xbac59a0ef;Xbea40387e;Xc1583a853;Xc9f9723a8;Xcbbd11961;Xccc23c93f;Xcd5c633f5;Xde7cf8720;Xde89d716f;Xe033c6179;Xe278bbad6;Xe462ee0b0;Xe9da56efb;Xeb3560ed0;Xec02a9f7d;Xecbe05d6d;Xedb31affc;Xf1c64b6ef;Xf5a44f9af;Xfe02ef20c;Xff3bdb73f,96,The availability of research data declines rapidly with article age,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5670,2013

1113,"One of the most important challenges in network science is to quantify the information encoded in complex network structures. Disentangling randomness from organizational principles is even more demanding when networks have a multiplex nature. Multiplex networks are multilayer systems of $N$ nodes that can be linked in multiple interacting and co-evolving layers. In these networks, relevant information might not be captured if the single layers were analyzed separately. Here we demonstrate that such partial analysis of layers fails to capture significant correlations between weights and topology of complex multiplex networks. To this end, we study two weighted multiplex co-authorship and citation networks involving the authors included in the American Physical Society. We show that in these networks weights are strongly correlated with multiplex structure, and provide empirical evidence in favor of the advantage of studying weighted measures of multiplex networks, such as multistrength and the inverse multiparticipation ratio. Finally, we introduce a theoretical framework based on the entropy of multiplex ensembles to quantify the information stored in multiplex networks that would remain undetected if the single layers were analyzed in isolation.","Menichetti, Giulia;Remondini, Daniel;Panzarasa, Pietro;Mondragón, Raúl J.;Bianconi, Ginestra",ArXiv e-prints,X15b817b30;X1f7b07157;X21ee46c1a;X2945bc383;X309716cc3;X333d0d11a;X4e725407a;X520c48a12;X53ce83741;X5a772fb58;X6049026c5;X610fe2329;X6645925a2;X6a23dc87c;X7018422d6;X7528094cc;X7ba5de255;X8ee889b1f;X8f0c18d23;X8f6028422;X9f87119a5;X9fae16ba5;Xa04d0307b;Xa2224b2a6;Xa38371d1d;Xaf5600ad3;Xbbe5bcd57;Xc0a3cc0d9;Xc6cba816a;Xc73a466ba;Xcccb01ddc;Xd35d2754e;Xd50869bf4;Xd63db0b73;Xdec205884;Xe488f308c;Xed24dbf67;Xed57d9e5d;Xf645a5e19;Xf7f555aa3,40,Weighted Multiplex Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6720,2013

1119,"Over the last decade, there has been growing interest in the assessment of the performance of researchers, research groups, universities and even countries. The assessment of productivity is an instrument to select and promote personnel, assign research grants and measure the results of research projects. One particular assessment approach is bibliometrics i.e., the quantitative analysis of scientific publications through citation and content analysis. However, there is little consensus today on how research evaluation should be performed, and it is commonly acknowledged that the quantitative metrics available today are largely unsatisfactory. A number of different scientific data sources available on the Web (e.g., DBLP, Google Scholar) that are used for such analysis purposes. Taking data from these diverse sources, performing the analysis and visualizing results in different ways is not a trivial and straight forward task. Moreover, people involved in such evaluation processes are not always IT experts and hence not capable to crawl data sources, merge them and compute the needed evaluation procedures. The recent emergence of mashup tools has refueled research on end-user development, i.e., on enabling end-users without programming skills to produce their own applications. We believe that the heart of the problem is that it is impractical to design tools that are generic enough to cover a wide range of application domains, powerful enough to enable the specification of non-trivial logic, and simple enough to be actually accessible to non-programmers. This thesis presents a novel approach for an effective end-user development, specifically for non-programmers. That is, we introduce a domain-specific approach to mashups that ""speaks the language of users""., i.e., that is aware of the terminology, concepts, rules, and conventions (the domain) the user is comfortable with.","Imran, Muhammad",ArXiv e-prints,X371094072;X4734faa92;X479df81f5;X4ca992837;X5eb9cb496;X659799cf4;X67aab3116;X8e0e3a185;Xa68acc6e7;Xb5542b095;Xb5ef136f3;Xc02c05275;Xcba1eb465;Xeba8c85fb;Xebcd91993,15,An Effective End-User Development Approach Through Domain-Specific Mashups for Research Impact Evaluation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7520,2013
1120,"Social tagging systems have established themselves as an important part in today's web and have attracted the interest from our research community in a variety of investigations. The overall vision of our community is that simply through interactions with the system, i.e., through tagging and sharing of resources, users would contribute to building useful semantic structures as well as resource indexes using uncontrolled vocabulary not only due to the easy-to-use mechanics. Henceforth, a variety of assumptions about social tagging systems have emerged, yet testing them has been difficult due to the absence of suitable data. In this work we thoroughly investigate three available assumptions - e.g., is a tagging system really social? - by examining live log data gathered from the real-world public social tagging system BibSonomy. Our empirical results indicate that while some of these assumptions hold to a certain extent, other assumptions need to be reflected and viewed in a very critical light. Our observations have implications for the design of future search and other algorithms to better reflect the actual user behavior.","Doerfel, Stephan;Zoller, Daniel;Singer, Philipp;Niebler, Thomas;Hotho, Andreas;Strohmaier, Markus",ArXiv e-prints,X04986eebf;X137d14afc;X20477adf0;X2dc0798ee;X41c1749e0;X4dfe6a8b3;X681ee6e73;X7b0e2936c;X7cc7d1811;X820f87d41;X8dfc9c46e;X933054a65;X9694277d2;X992d786f6;X9be08b2ae;X9df9acbac;X9f9566c45;Xa1992b2ea;Xa55b2e056;Xa5c8f609f;Xa9b7c866c;Xb107cb267;Xc1f6bbbf5;Xcb798ab25;Xcfd7fd8c8;Xd3cbea70a;Xdbbe5d1dd;Xdede4b014;Xe4c4a2357;Xe74a90563;Xf1ebbbcb7;Xf413da12a,32,Of course we share!

1124,"We present, visualize and analyse the similarities and differences between the controversial topics related to ""edit wars"" identified in 10 different language versions of Wikipedia. After a brief review of the related work we describe the methods developed to locate, measure, and categorize the controversial topics in the different languages. Visualizations of the degree of overlap between the top 100 lists of most controversial articles in different languages and the content related to geographical locations will be presented. We discuss what the presented analysis and visualizations can tell us about the multicultural aspects of Wikipedia and practices of peer-production.

1125,"Bibliometricians face several issues when drawing and analyzing samples of citation records for their research. Drawing samples that are too small may make it difficult or impossible for studies to achieve their goals, while drawing samples that are too large may drain resources that could be better used for other purposes. This paper considers three common situations and offers advice for dealing with each. First, an entire population of records is available for an institution. We argue that, even though all records have been collected, the use of inferential statistics and significance testing is both common and desirable. Second, because of limited resources or other factors, a sample of records needs to be drawn. We demonstrate how power analyses can be used to determine in advance how large the sample needs to be to achieve the study's goals. Third, the sample size may already be determined, either because the data have already been collected or because resources are limited. We show how power analyses can again be used to determine how large effects need to be in order to find effects that are statistically significant. Such information can then help researchers to develop reasonable expectations as to what their analysis can accomplish. While we focus on issues of interest to bibliometricians, our recommendations and procedures can easily be adapted for other fields of study.","Williams, Richard;Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X0007cee9f;X0b430dc77;X20bdecfc4;X2394659d9;X35439b6bd;X4401b1f98;X50ea62dbb;X5d7c09e1f;X6a02f752f;X78dca00ea;X7b116c5e4;X7d7e89c21;X881df8ff4;X8e8bb2c6d;Xa1b994b71;Xa3fc83ead;Xa692a9c66;Xa6b7270f5;Xb18b071f3;Xb50e05f0b;Xbe4e39122;Xc49b47e04;Xd1bbe19f5;Xd20a10026;Xd3a81d4c5;Xe017a8aba;Xebb18db6d;Xf20e17ca8;Xfca4ac0d6,29,Sampling Issues in Bibliometric Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2254,2014
1126,"Over the past decade, rapid advances in web technologies, coupled with innovative models of spatial data collection and consumption, have generated a robust growth in geo-referenced information, resulting in spatial information overload. Increasing 'geographic intelligence' in traditional text-based information retrieval has become a prominent approach to respond to this issue and to fulfill users' spatial information needs. Numerous efforts in the Semantic Geospatial Web, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), and the Linking Open Data initiative have converged in a constellation of open knowledge bases, freely available online. In this article, we survey these open knowledge bases, focusing on their geospatial dimension. Particular attention is devoted to the crucial issue of the quality of geo-knowledge bases, as well as of crowdsourced data. A new knowledge base, the OpenStreetMap Semantic Network, is outlined as our contribution to this area. Research directions in information integration and Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) are then reviewed, with a critical discussion of their current limitations and future prospects.","Ballatore, Andrea;Wilson, David C.;Bertolotto, Michela",ArXiv e-prints,X0091cc4e7;X03268f2c0;X03a861a0d;X09b936bc0;X0e8e3cbe5;X102d76f8c;X12e4b4f9f;X17d93063d;X1b0a294e2;X1b9df2992;X250ae5510;X2717274f4;X29d5b9439;X311948d05;X34de022f2;X38d7ec833;X42af29032;X44ca097b3;X4a674871b;X4ab530895;X4cd625b0d;X539f231a8;X5456a2a18;X5668ab655;X59437fbf0;X61d4e97b5;X6b75f93d9;X743e3b310;X785816b7e;X7fb93ef00;X85f8948d3;X8854861aa;X8fe018f4d;X929b1e076;X930482501;X95bdf1a64;X990fc8b69;X9995f450c;X9ae51cde2;X9c804e961;Xa7fad295a;Xad2d648f7;Xad621ddde;Xae6abbf20;Xb58eea80d;Xb7522b304;Xb91b21d3a;Xc4671dec2;Xc814bcd8d;Xc8ee01c89;Xd03b967fc;Xd55ac1b3b;Xd77327b34;Xdd6afb11d;Xdf52165da;Xdf8aa1f6e;Xe03a92397;Xe4b37a71b;Xf12552824;Xf8e1f12c0;Xf978db2b7;Xfa97c5f3b,62,A Survey of Volunteered Open Geo-Knowledge Bases in the Semantic Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2610,2014
1127,"Strongly anticipatory systems-that is, systems which use models of themselves for their further development-and which additionally may be able to run hyperincursive routines-that is, develop only with reference to their future states-cannot exist in res extensa, but can only be envisaged in res cogitans. One needs incursive routines in cogitantes to instantiate these systems. Unlike historical systems (with recursion), these hyper-incursive routines generate redundancies by opening horizons of other possible states. Thus, intentional systems can enrich our perceptions of the cases that have happened to occur. The perspective of hindsight codified at the above-individual level enables us furthermore to intervene technologically. The theory and computation of anticipatory systems have made these loops between supra-individual hyper-incursion, individual incursion (in instantiation), and historical recursion accessible for modeling and empirical investigation.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X2b1fbe681;X2b543f738;X4a187e820;X6a80a0aaf;X874b5d876;Xa805ad966;Xd5bd70841;Xd8b27dc1e,8,Hyperincursive Cogitata and Incursive Cogitantes: Scholarly Discourse as a Strongly Anticipatory System,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5651,2011
1128,"The dynamics of innovation are nonlinear and complex: geographical, technological, and economic selection environments can be expected to interact. Can patents provide an analytical lens to this process in terms of different attributes such as inventor addresses, classification codes, backward and forward citations, etc.? Two recently developed patent maps with interactive overlay techniques--Google Maps and maps based on citation relations among International Patent Classifications (IPC)--are elaborated into dynamic versions that allow for online animations and comparisons by using split screens. Various forms of animation are explored. The recently developed Cooperative Patent Classifications (CPC) of the U.S. Patent and Trade Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) provide new options for a precise delineation of samples in both USPTO data and the Worldwide Patent Statistics Database (PatStat) of EPO. Among the ""technologies for the mitigation of climate change"" (class Y02), we zoom in on nine material technologies for photovoltaic cells; and focus on one of them (CuInSe2) as a lead case. The longitudinal development of Rao-Stirling diversity in the IPC-based maps provides a heuristics for studying technological generations during the period under study (1975-2012). The sequencing of generations prevails in USPTO data more than in PatStat data because PatStat aggregates patent information from countries in different stages of technological development, whereas one can expect USPTO patents to be competitive at the technological edge.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Alkemade, Floortje;Heimeriks, Gaston;Hoekstra, Rinke",ArXiv e-prints,54f9075c79;X0477bb7b4;X050767ff6;X07bbe0aa2;X0b1d29555;X10a6af537;X119683aca;X12604cbad;X16d0e7a40;X16f8cabdf;X17bc36948;X1b01cb571;X1c257f3a7;X1c64a5c12;X1cde41ef0;X1d90e9973;X1fcbf21ec;X201f7b3d9;X21c602288;X224e12a08;X24757d814;X25390d6f5;X2ccd55703;X2e6b3d3a2;X34abce6d1;X359a43ca3;X3c9f756d1;X3df444a47;X3e904421c;X3f3ff27e3;X414b119a4;X43bfdf93e;X45bbab58c;X4bdb729d8;X559481c48;X55ff57b1c;X56373f0b3;X60b91feb5;X6219ca39b;X624b5ae17;X68a0bfeac;X6c716f308;X711020fc7;X723e0c880;X7395cab7d;X7483f192c;X75f01ddee;X76af7b1c9;X77c901e65;X78714b762;X80e641741;X8377c8634;X84dace0bd;X868e11c94;X87ded268f;X8b663e73d;X8c1b2ba5d;X8e3c5a937;X8f1fe800d;X90a000e63;X90dd07739;X96f2e38b3;X9ac3c6ae0;X9c9b635fe;Xa003dcb88;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa6bf33243;Xa9157de34;Xac85a5ca3;Xb002b82d8;Xb06aa336d;Xb1f93f6f3;Xb2c6c3f13;Xb3510f4e7;Xb746a908d;Xbc803ed6b;Xbe4e39122;Xbf14e6cfa;Xbfa424d7a;Xca617450f;Xcda321763;Xcf17b9f95;Xcfb1b5873;Xd02d9d76f;Xd39e48186;Xd804939ad;Xd9a9e0e17;Xd9c49163f;Xda215ee16;Xdaa1bda31;Xdc3843ce2;Xddbf7f0df;Xdee7e8fc3;Xe27350c56;Xe34dd7375;Xec7d9c450;Xee3341900;Xf1c64b6ef;Xf279781b7;Xf3400432b;Xf3ba9d494;Xf5e1c87d6;Xf92e48295;Xf9cdd8f60;Xf9e9a1b9e;Xfce51eedf,107,"Patents as Instruments for Exploring Innovation Dynamics: Geographic and Technological Perspectives on ""Photovoltaic Cells""",http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2778,2014
1129,"Bornmann, Stefaner, de Moya Anegon, and Mutz (in press) have introduced a web application (www.excellencemapping.net) which is linked to both academic ranking lists published hitherto (e.g. the Academic Ranking of World Universities) as well as spatial visualization approaches. The web application visualizes institutional performance within specific subject areas as ranking lists and on custom tile-based maps. The new, substantially enhanced version of the web application and the multilevel logistic regression on which it is based are described in this paper. Scopus data were used which have been collected for the SCImago Institutions Ranking. Only those universities and research-focused institutions are considered that have published at least 500 articles, reviews and conference papers in the period 2006 to 2010 in a certain Scopus subject area. In the enhanced version, the effect of single covariates (such as the per capita GDP of a country in which an institution is located) on two performance metrics (best paper rate and best journal rate) is examined and visualized. A covariate-adjusted ranking and mapping of the institutions is produced in which the single covariates are held constant. The results on the performance of institutions can then be interpreted as if the institutions all had the same value (reference point) for the covariate in question. For example, those institutions can be identified worldwide showing a very good performance despite a bad financial situation in the corresponding country.","Bornmann, Lutz;Stefaner, Moritz;de Moya Anegon, Felix;Mutz, Ruediger",ArXiv e-prints,X0daabdb7a;X1c230ce67;X20bdecfc4;X2219db5a6;X262a43fda;X2c1eaa117;X2e180d82c;X2e2590bdb;X2e87ee54f;X33d3b8da2;X397ced860;X3c681a1e3;X3ebb18fd8;X40556a6a5;X433c57fe4;X4ce677b5f;X4db4fef4f;X583e4626a;X5d427ba8f;X5e0ca5543;X683df3e8c;X72b1cda7f;X81cbd4617;X99e507f82;Xa07b6a2f3;Xa11466bf7;Xa1b994b71;Xa4cb3f6b8;Xb59cbb517;Xbc0bb839a;Xbe4e39122;Xc6ae82393;Xc7032d365;Xe9db8e47f;Xf31057261;Xf65bbbc87;Xf6ae2116e;Xfca4ac0d6,38,What is the effect of country-specific characteristics on the research performance of scientific institutions?

1130,"Commercial OCR packages work best with high-quality scanned images. They often produce poor results when the image is degraded, either because the original itself was poor quality, or because of excessive photocopying. The ability to predict the word failure rate of OCR from a statistical analysis of the image can help in making decisions in the trade-off between the success rate of OCR and the cost of human correction of errors. This paper describes an investigation of OCR of degraded text images using a standard OCR engine (Adobe Capture). The documents were selected from those in the archive at Los Alamos National Laboratory. By introducing noise in a controlled manner into perfect documents, we show how the quality of OCR can be predicted from the nature of the noise. The preliminary results show that a simple noise model can give good prediction of the number of OCR errors.","Hartley, Roger T.;Crumpton, Kathleen",ArXiv e-prints,X3d0492c2d;X79cb2e020;X805d7a391;X984e3bd46;Xcfcc7a828;Xd41c74730;Xe85c6cb6a,7,Quality of OCR for Degraded Text Images,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9902009,1999
1131,"Copyright in the cultural sphere can act as a barrier to the dissemination of high-quality information. On the other hand it protects works of art that might not be made available otherwise. This dichotomy makes the area of copyright difficult, especially when it applies to the digital arena of the web where copying is so easy and natural. Here we present a snapshot of the issues for online copyright, with particular emphasis on the relevance to cultural institutions.

1132,"It is examined whether the relationship $ J \propto A/r^{\alpha}$, and the subsequent coauthor core notion (Ausloos 2013), between the number ($J$) of joint publications (JP) by a ""main scientist"" (LI) with her/his coauthors (CAs) can be extended to a team-like system. This is done by considering that each coauthor can be so strongly tied to the LI that they are forming {\it binary scientific star} (BSS) systems with respect to their other collaborators. Moreover, publications in peer review journals and in ""proceedings"", both often thought to be of ""different quality"", are separetely distinguished. The role of a time interval for measuring $J$ and $\alpha$ is also examined. New indirect measures are also introduced. For making the point, two LI cases with numerous CAs are studied. It is found that only a few BSS need to be usefully examined. The exponent $\alpha$ turns out to be ""second scientist"" weakly dependent, but still ""size"" and ""publication type"" dependent, according to the number of CAs or JP. The CA core value is found to be (CA or JP) size and publication type dependent, but remains in an understandable range. Somewhat unexpectedly, no special qualitative difference on the binary scientific star CA core value is found between publications in peer review journals and in proceedings. In conclusion, some remark is made on partner cooperation in BSS teams. It is suggested that such measures can serve as criteria for distinguishing the role of scientists in a team.","Ausloos, Marcel",ArXiv e-prints,X20bdecfc4;X47719bde4;X640663007;Xa3d1b3e1b;Xa9bfaaa6f;Xfca4ac0d6,6,Binary Scientific Star Coauthors Core Size,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4069,2014
1133,"To make digital resources on the web verifiable, immutable, and permanent, we propose a technique to include cryptographic hash values in URIs. We call them trusty URIs and we show how they can be used for approaches like nanopublications to make not only specific resources but their entire reference trees verifiable. Digital artifacts can be identified not only on the byte level but on more abstract levels such as RDF graphs, which means that resources keep their hash values even when presented in a different format. Our approach sticks to the core principles of the web, namely openness and decentralized architecture, is fully compatible with existing standards and protocols, and can therefore be used right away. Evaluation of our reference implementations shows that these desired properties are indeed accomplished by our approach, and that it remains practical even for very large files.","Kuhn, Tobias;Dumontier, Michel",ArXiv e-prints,X0098c6bc9;X01e466cbd;X1376b6435;X13af1f8b4;X165056dc5;X1c305bd9e;X1d9688fc1;X1db218842;X204920308;X20e0888ca;X23b88ea94;X26362ce98;X319e70564;X3450ec3dc;X3b41c8d96;X444752d1d;X48d672cc4;X4be01a967;X50c01e073;X585695785;X588162116;X5de99432b;X5ff974c5b;X649e9bfbd;X656033cc9;X6dba495da;X73f7dd9b1;X74b9b15a3;X7be1c4aac;X7e2e23a54;X7eb538719;X81b6a84ea;X8234a5829;X82d26ae85;X848c1ed46;X84f6f22c9;X87f9dd91c;X88ea22a1b;X896e36834;X8bc67cba7;X8ced1b5ab;X8e0390444;X8f2b70ffc;X9a776ae37;X9cb01d7b9;X9e0a4e982;Xa010ea3d9;Xa014c55b3;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa5525f8d0;Xa6c674ef4;Xa99e8267f;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xb2131678d;Xb94560db2;Xbb4f51331;Xc0342a229;Xc10716d85;Xc1c916f74;Xc1f27dd48;Xc4a40f427;Xc6c67deed;Xc9da4f352;Xd3b5b19b0;Xd46a71cd4;Xd796f932b;Xd85b0d4db;Xd941661aa;Xdd8c3727c;Xe06c8c17d;Xeb17df072;Xeeef9dc1c;Xf5a83abcf;Xf780babcc;Xf886532e8;Xfcb0c1ebd;Xff4189165,77,"Trusty URIs: Verifiable, Immutable, and Permanent Digital Artifacts for Linked Data",http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5775,2014
1134,"Research in life sciences is increasingly being conducted in a digital and online environment. In particular, life scientists have been pioneers in embracing new computational tools to conduct their investigations. To support the sharing of digital objects produced during such research investigations, we have witnessed in the last few years the emergence of specialized repositories, e.g., DataVerse and FigShare. Such repositories provide users with the means to share and publish datasets that were used or generated in research investigations. While these repositories have proven their usefulness, interpreting and reusing evidence for most research results is a challenging task. Additional contextual descriptions are needed to understand how those results were generated and/or the circumstances under which they were concluded. Because of this, scientists are calling for models that go beyond the publication of datasets to systematically capture the life cycle of scientific investigations and provide a single entry point to access the information about the hypothesis investigated, the datasets used, the experiments carried out, the results of the experiments, the people involved in the research, etc. In this paper we present the Research Object (RO) suite of ontologies, which provide a structured container to encapsulate research data and methods along with essential metadata descriptions. Research Objects are portable units that enable the sharing, preservation, interpretation and reuse of research investigation results. The ontologies we present have been designed in the light of requirements that we gathered from life scientists. They have been built upon existing popular vocabularies to facilitate interoperability. Furthermore, we have developed tools to support the creation and sharing of Research Objects, thereby promoting and facilitating their adoption.","Belhajjame, Khalid;Zhao, Jun;Garijo, Daniel;Hettne, Kristina;Palma, Raul;Corcho, Óscar;Gómez-Pérez, José-Manuel;Bechhofer, Sean;Klyne, Graham;Goble, Carole",ArXiv e-prints,X04543e269;X05a8a5d10;X1b88bf528;X26bca6eb5;X3141702f5;X315cb814c;X327d01cdd;X37394c389;X3858b14d0;X3bae89cd8;X3ead65e0d;X42b5ce01f;X47a6b4392;X4879ac23e;X4b2e4867a;X55b7f6527;X5b73f511d;X68754cb7b;X6b17175bb;X6cf749e22;X6dc765ec8;X76ce71e52;X78ecd71fb;X78f3f1285;X7d5117b0f;X809601670;X80d417b5e;X8332216a5;X8bc67cba7;X954f93e3c;X97b973913;X994e49168;X9cfc4317d;Xa1b994b71;Xabea5849c;Xb230c1264;Xb75a84ac2;Xbbd5b787a;Xbc117119e;Xbf8bd277a;Xc10c7c14c;Xd25519716;Xd36b7393e;Xd3ada6f04;Xd43ba8e5a;Xd46a71cd4;Xdaf63c430;Xdcf615e47;Xdf087b866;Xebc140ff9;Xf653536a1;Xf725d0364,52,The Research Object Suite of Ontologies: Sharing and Exchanging Research Data and Methods on the Open Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4307,2014
1135,"An extensive analysis of the presence of different altmetric indicators provided by Altmetric.com across scientific fields is presented, particularly focusing on their relationship with citations. Our results confirm that the presence and density of social media altmetric counts are still very low and not very frequent among scientific publications, with 15%-24% of the publications presenting some altmetric activity and concentrating in the most recent publications, although their presence is increasing over time. Publications from the social sciences, humanities and the medical and life sciences show the highest presence of altmetrics, indicating their potential value and interest for these fields. The analysis of the relationships between altmetrics and citations confirms previous claims of positive correlations but relatively weak, thus supporting the idea that altmetrics do not reflect the same concept of impact as citations. Also, altmetric counts do not always present a better filtering of highly cited publications than journal citation scores. Altmetrics scores (particularly mentions in blogs) are able to identify highly cited publications with higher levels of precision than journal citation scores (JCS), but they have a lower level of recall. The value of altmetrics as a complementary tool of citation analysis is highlighted, although more research is suggested to disentangle the potential meaning and value of altmetric indicators for research evaluation.","Costas, Rodrigo;Zahedi, Zohreh;Wouters, Paul",ArXiv e-prints,X03f14e304;X0954e8445;X0a1dbf5d0;X0bb577a13;X0c4f65344;X0daf0ffbf;X0dd9f7107;X116ee07ee;X14b5ba16b;X17e8709d7;X1bcc9d8ff;X1c072a6c0;X200dc17a1;X2559a1473;X268541f55;X2ca7c9a93;X2d3306bf0;X3037e4bad;X30442e748;X309fed65e;X3221b4492;X33067922c;X330dab672;X335d6cd62;X33db9cbf2;X378a992f1;X3ae2bcabc;X3d07991ee;X3d45c54af;X3e416566c;X425fec513;X442dfc6fc;X4496d239d;X488a3f320;X4c00191e2;X4dce8264d;X4fe498315;X508bbf75b;X512876ebe;X594940696;X5c731e96b;X5f0a07943;X6042ba6f6;X6338a2696;X68d208943;X69efe3184;X6a7ff924a;X6c74a1aa2;X6d606c25b;X701012642;X706f24f89;X71c59238c;X74887d757;X764cdd75a;X7c51ca0b5;X7d3f03970;X7d5822c0c;X7d8c00717;X7e7b859cb;X82690b573;X8571ef23e;X87764ad6d;X8baa9cc98;X8c03a86ed;X8e5d6c05d;X8e9429c6a;X9156758d1;X9308ca7ee;X945d5fcbd;X94ba7afb2;X94e2c59ab;X95b93ae54;X9917452c8;X994fcad80;X9a0e28b8b;X9ebf21399;Xa1b994b71;Xa3d71f9be;Xa9f2efeb0;Xab35205f7;Xad2689c05;Xad66e866e;Xaebd3617e;Xaf159fd47;Xb0031e6fa;Xb0d63a747;Xb2a80f035;Xb483e3648;Xb6b31ee28;Xbbe902cdf;Xbff974557;Xc0b22f798;Xca9606066;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xcbdeb5a6e;Xcf5e21c61;Xd550d7a98;Xdb2c3b1c7;Xdcdfcaabb;Xde7bebba9;Xdf142d981;Xe29429c7d;Xe88417d44;Xec3e0b62a;Xec546f8df;Xf3c387a30;Xf543d6eac;Xf57b7ae31;Xf585d7c9f;Xfad3799ce,110,Do altmetrics correlate with citations?

1136,"The paper proposes an approach to transcend multicultural and multilingual barriers in the use and reuse of geographical data at the European level. The approach aims at sharing scientific terms in the field of nature conservation with the goal of assisting different user communities with metadata compilation and information discovery. A multi-thesauri solution is proposed, based on a Common Thesaurus Framework for Nature Conservation, where different well-known Knowledge Organization Systems are assembled and shared. It has been designed according to semantic web and W3C recommendations employing SKOS standard models and Linked Data to publish the thesauri as a whole in machine-understandable format. The outcome is a powerful framework satisfying the requirements of modularity and openness for further thesaurus extension and updating, interlinking among thesauri, and exploitability from other systems. The paper supports the employment of Linked Data to deal with terminologies in complex domains such as nature conservation and it proposes a hands-on recipe to publish thesauri in the framework.","De Martino, Monica;Albertoni, Riccardo",ArXiv e-prints,X02447b293;X02b9cda31;X042f428be;X04ec8d021;X0508c9a0b;X066073305;X066b53aad;X087b217d6;X0afba20d1;X0b1736b3c;X0c8f5d221;X0d1af3c88;X0d7593824;X0ec2847bf;X0f81a2de4;X0ff3738b2;X10ad7f155;X111929a6f;X11c1dae56;X11d9f1dd1;X124724808;X13b666005;X144c64b1f;X16bbee37e;X17157595d;X18513b9e1;X1951df7ec;X19ed16bfa;X1aa911bc7;X1ac64a02c;X1b768bef2;X1c4d7c9fc;X1f7cabe9a;X2044ea6b4;X22549443c;X231eec9c1;X238290d8f;X23bdf2a52;X24f33442f;X256d74471;X26901823e;X282a981fe;X28952b3a2;X2a059d0a3;X2a113acc7;X2a2b0ab00;X2b0f92455;X2b543f738;X2c2478b64;X2c4a5f68a;X2cdb49932;X2dc0798ee;X2f5a05dbd;X30cd14e20;X3113c1546;X328190261;X32b064f68;X332bbc3a5;X35aa8f69a;X35b43c7ba;X36a01f8ed;X36fb21bf0;X385153ebe;X385914a0a;X3911222c6;X3926c656b;X3a6c698f5;X3a8c6a52d;X3cffffe4d;X3f4764f34;X4098fba09;X40b4005ec;X41ce76970;X41e1472eb;X4328f02b9;X43a39ec76;X43b23e425;X453e8f924;X45e07ddf8;X462872da9;X4666facbc;X46d90fcf0;X48f01e18f;X491be3282;X4a2d53a69;X4a69b90db;X4aa41f1c1;X4b3071b0a;X4ca655170;X4cc5f11c3;X4cffe19cc;X4d99c2d1e;X4e575537a;X4ed02a7e8;X4f00de6a0;X4f76f1613;X4fbd77d43;X526efb103;X53a7bda31;X5525a51be;X558f4042b;X56a5d8ba1;X57837c7dc;X582994362;X593e05d15;X59ee0b334;X5a5e72318;X5aa3fca08;X5b515c6df;X5b947e7d0;X5bbc72641;X5bd154867;X5cb369680;X605370582;X6101b7639;X6191a17d0;X62e90a846;X62f51d32c;X62f8ecc21;X63e7bd39a;X6480071e6;X6489f4cac;X655040fce;X66e51779c;X672c22ae4;X673c3de59;X67f09dac2;X6b31611e1;X6d86313cf;X6d93dcdfe;X6f906834c;X6fc6944d8;X701293ebd;X703ccf77e;X706533f81;X7188ba832;X726101910;X73c092d8d;X7537b1a21;X757fd3860;X7582de1d2;X771eb2ab6;X7913ff13e;X79f9b1397;X7a42acd90;X7a63b2f21;X7b6db10e1;X7bfe1cfc9;X7d7741fdd;X7e59e10e4;X7f79478c1;X7fde53f59;X80035f6e9;X80c996d7d;X80dd2471c;X827a96e72;X8345c949e;X8410e5a74;X844a9d42c;X8574d179c;X85b5a081e;X86c487c6e;X86fcaf1fd;X87379b6b3;X8744665af;X87789fb6a;X8839da2f6;X898173c00;X8a43b0e0f;X8b48f07ab;X8c784cde5;X8d6e71331;X8da677a73;X8defb712e;X90d36d49c;X923aba731;X95d3baab5;X96d0262c9;X9a85a0b9b;X9c085bf30;X9c1cd6823;X9c22297cd;X9d84cd2ef;X9d9424fc0;X9ddac7d7f;X9df7f67de;X9fa64a0b5;Xa047c7bf1;Xa0737716b;Xa0a42531d;Xa141a01b1;Xa17c3931e;Xa3590d4a2;Xa37ec3f36;Xa49333755;Xa5399fe7e;Xa5f25d022;Xaa55f5d2b;Xab14d2ee5;Xad317e4a9;Xae681132a;Xaff586505;Xb2714c835;Xb2e5a8490;Xb2eefcccd;Xb44e9d9db;Xb57733b60;Xb62399c46;Xb6f433aa0;Xb7aa53ec8;Xb838f9842;Xb90f7ed12;Xbc128883e;Xbc26274c3;Xbc99b110f;Xbe2412ca5;Xbe9b0ca33;Xc053ddd3b;Xc0f752a14;Xc12bfa38a;Xc2997bafa;Xc2cf5fbed;Xc313d8430;Xc385616ea;Xc49d3210d;Xc6c93d391;Xc9d37f3c0;Xca952bbec;Xcd26e9f8c;Xcd7ceded3;Xce06df0c0;Xce0e78d79;Xce1119f8e;Xcf307cd6f;Xcf70500d6;Xd178702fe;Xd21ce4e22;Xd28c4f934;Xd2a05cfef;Xd336ed430;Xd349d1148;Xd44fa74f5;Xd59061d2b;Xd8ae667f9;Xd902f762b;Xd982f5a5f;Xd9fce15ff;Xdaed219aa;Xdb9c990e2;Xdbd2b088e;Xdc48427bd;Xdddd4b666;Xde473e5ad;Xde51dd21a;Xdfa3336e9;Xe075841b3;Xe182f6e77;Xe1ad6723e;Xe1baf1624;Xe24e383fa;Xe28beb255;Xe417f71b0;Xe45bbc93c;Xe4be16495;Xe50b045ab;Xe5586a154;Xe6d3539c7;Xe83aa0b86;Xe8f90dda5;Xe963a87f4;Xe97b99dd6;Xe983b66f6;Xe999c03dc;Xea45ec18a;Xeab47954d;Xeaba5def4;Xebd4cdbd7;Xee3009ad3;Xeee8698d8;Xef9e461be;Xf1b0abc16;Xf1b61d413;Xf2eea8aff;Xf551dc04e;Xf609d0a37;Xf73b2f9ce;Xf98034418;Xf9daeb048;Xf9db774fa;Xfa3585f15;Xfa4b48d78;Xfa7c2411c;Xfa93f2895;Xfb2913531;Xfba0e6b3a;Xfc04b7723;Xfe20c1d18;Xfe8759a3f;Xfebe21e7a,299,A multilingual/multicultural semantic-based approach to improve Data Sharing in an SDI for Nature Conservation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1676,2011

1139,"Optimized reviewer assignment can effectively utilize limited intellectual resources and significantly assure review quality in various scenarios such as paper selection in conference or journal, proposal selection in funding agencies and so on. However, little research on reviewer assignment of software peer review has been found. In this study, an optimization approach is proposed based on students' preference matrix and the model of asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). Due to the most critical role of rule matrix in this approach, we conduct a questionnaire to obtain students' preference matrices and convert them to rule matrices. With the help of software ILOG CPLEX, the approach is accomplished by controlling the exit criterion of ATSP model. The comparative study shows that the assignment strategies with both reviewers' preference matrix and authors' preference matrix get better performance than the random assignment. Especially, it is found that the performance is just a little better than that of random assignment when the reviewers' and authors' preference matrices are merged. In other words, the majority of students have a strong wish of harmonious development even though high-level students are not willing to do that.","Wang, Yanqing;Jiang, Yu;Wang, Xiaolei;Zhang, Siyu;Liang, Yaowen",ArXiv e-prints,X14af90ae9;X207169468;X294c66a7e;X2e02ec727;X3190d00b5;X33b23794c;X358a0f27a;X35957dfcb;X3e5328d00;X48d62a16e;X56c9c9860;X57d30f73a;X5b21dfcac;X654ce58a6;X7ac8bb2ae;X838491abf;X96845ca8e;X9946998d5;X9f1ce7bbf;Xa76871a1e;Xa8f8ba34c;Xad70c6ddd;Xc37d2b0e2;Xc7c5c6d5b;Xcd679f395,25,Solving reviewer assignment problem in software peer review: An approach based on preference matrix and asymmetric TSP model,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4516,2014
1140,"Many of the essential features of the evolution of scientific research are imprinted in the structure of citation networks. Connections in these networks imply information about the transfer of knowledge among papers, or, in other words, edges describe the impact of papers on other publications. This inherent meaning of the edges implies that citation networks can exhibit hierarchical features that are typical of networks based on decision making. In this paper, we investigate the hierarchical structure of citation networks consisting of papers in the same field. We find that the majority of the networks follow a universal trend towards a highly hierarchical state, and the various fields display differences only concerning (i) their phase in life (distance from the ‘birth’ of a field) or (ii) the characteristic time according to which they are approaching the stationary state. We also show by a simple argument that the alterations in the behavior are related to and can be understood by the degree of specialization corresponding to the fields. Our results suggest that during the accumulation of knowledge in a given field, some papers are gradually becoming relatively more influential than most other papers.","Mones, Enys;Pollner, Péter;Vicsek, Tamás",Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment,X1e3014407;X20bdecfc4;X29d6401ac;X46be42b82;X667f2f304;X7d2ecd50e;X8d732910e;X8e3a3969b;X967f660ed;Xa1b994b71;Xb50e05f0b;Xbc915ef9d;Xc107070b3,13,Universal hierarchical behavior of citation networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4676,2014

In around 80% of the papers analyzed in this study, a quantitative definition has been provided with which to identify excellent papers. With definitions which relate to an absolute number, either a certain number of top cited papers (58%) or papers with a minimum number of citations are selected (17%). Around 23% worked with percentile rank classes. Over these papers, there is an arithmetic average of the top 7.6% (arithmetic average) or of the top 3% (median). The top 1% is used most frequently in the papers, followed by the top 10%.

1142,"Modelling actors of science via science (overlay) maps has recently become a popular practice in Interdisciplinarity Research (IDR). The benefits of this toolkit have also been recognized for other areas of scientometrics, such as the study of science dynamics. In this paper we propose novel methods of measuring knowledge diffusion/integration based on previous applications of the overlay methodology. New indices called Mean Overlay Distance and Overlay Diversity Ratio, respectively, are being drawn from previous uses of the Stirling index as the main proxy for knowledge diversification. We demonstrate the added value of this proposal via a case study addressing the development of a rather complex discourse in biology, usually referred to as the Species Problem. The selected topic is known for a history connecting various research fields and traditions, being, therefore, both an ideal and challenging case for the study of knowledge diffusion.","Soós, Sándor",ArXiv e-prints,X1c4190eb2;X20f8b62bb;X2a816e77f;X3d88c083b;X403e1ec26;X510262863;X69b2e438a;Xa032f3af1;Xa0c327b3d;Xa0f721c4b;Xa1b994b71;Xac327a3a3;Xb25bdb72e;Xceefeaaf7;Xdd53779bc;Xf4299fb11;Xfca4ac0d6,17,How science maps reveal knowledge transfer: new measurement for a historical case,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5675,2014
1143,"We present a novel algorithm and validation method for disambiguating author names in very large bibliographic data sets and apply it to the full Web of Science (WoS) citation index. Our algorithm relies only upon the author and citation graphs available for the whole period covered by the WoS. A pair-wise publication similarity metric, which is based on common co-authors, self-citations, shared references and citations, is established to perform a two-step agglomerative clustering that first connects individual papers and then merges similar clusters. This parameterized model is optimized using an h-index based recall measure, favoring the correct assignment of well-cited publications, and a name-initials-based precision using WoS metadata and cross-referenced Google Scholar profiles. Despite the use of limited metadata, we reach a recall of 87% and a precision of 88% with a preference for researchers with high h-index values. 47 million articles of WoS can be disambiguated on a single machine in less than a day. We develop an h-index distribution model, confirming that the prediction is in excellent agreement with the empirical data, and yielding insight into the utility of the h-index in real academic ranking scenarios.","Schulz, Christian;Mazloumian, Amin;Petersen, Alexander M;Penner, Orion;Helbing, Dirk",ArXiv e-prints,X05d4c5908;X074c1e362;X0b559beb5;X10ef48673;X18bff2d9d;X19aee4d5c;X201a95f92;X2967b137d;X40389a7ed;X438dc84e2;X46957821a;X485b55672;X49ebbaeff;X514f6139a;X551fc75c5;X565e1b64a;X5a7207132;X5a72e6a96;X5ad5285c1;X5c295ad48;X5d0d2cba9;X65289945f;X6538ecced;X65e25e3a2;X746e290ec;X76b2432b3;X76bba3518;X7c42e8ee0;X7e64cf8a9;X7fc7a7911;X854b3e855;X85b2f1bc3;X8b41e7fda;X92f2197e0;X9e6786660;Xa2295a8f4;Xa29072af9;Xa54b45816;Xaa049e592;Xab01a1fa1;Xab69891b4;Xabf26ec05;Xb395b2b85;Xc2bef6794;Xc4306c7f5;Xc5b3490a5;Xc823b2544;Xc8359da70;Xc951e17c2;Xca719cf0a;Xd10ac04c5;Xd40bd03d5;Xd46f6f796;Xd55ac1b3b;Xdb3501e33;Xe36e5e5fb;Xe9326496a;Xee5a6fc5d;Xf206f1ea5;Xf25cd000c;Xf27b64db0;Xfad0a522a;Xfca4ac0d6,63,Exploiting citation networks for large-scale author name disambiguation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6157,2014

Specifically, we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, bursts of popularity in bookmarking and a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags within a given url. We also present a dynamical model of collaborative tagging that predicts these stable patterns and relates them to imitation and shared knowledge.","Golder, Scott;Huberman, Bernardo A.",ArXiv e-prints,X0516a5730;X05de9c2ff;X06b561031;X074b511be;X0a443b732;X0dbb898fe;X0df7329c6;X0e8589b3b;X11637598e;X13b806b65;X1582f72a4;X178dd6f76;X19051d750;X1982ec3ab;X1c16a02a7;X1c7099ed2;X1d5bbc943;X22f63931a;X233368028;X2340b1c4f;X24c1cbfff;X260a59d54;X26283ca52;X268cc2fb4;X2931f8f20;X2cc368210;X2cf4239ea;X2d9905bbf;X33bcc2f48;X35129b07d;X35bb0ffef;X3674def92;X39d2d0baa;X3b1aebe4c;X3c85259f2;X4029afe51;X406db92f6;X418b3f5a1;X439f51026;X44c5bebe5;X44c8dd60c;X457bc9675;X463a6bb30;X466fcc41b;X46800085f;X48db0b581;X4b93089ad;X530227f22;X53e08a886;X546f41951;X572b9c4ab;X577c03be4;X5951a6c98;X59608ad9d;X5970c5600;X5a1019aef;X5ada692fe;X5ceda9d11;X5e0aa6920;X611ac01d2;X643d71c12;X645025761;X647392266;X64ee84ebf;X67efa7cb1;X683825f6c;X6971c39cd;X6c74a1aa2;X6ce29fd1f;X6df1ff37e;X6f514c52f;X6ff8a2d50;X709ba966c;X718e835a2;X723ae5bb4;X7773503c9;X78b018936;X7e2e4b674;X81e021575;X82edbd0ec;X86c487c6e;X8bfc81cab;X8cd17292f;X91c295e66;X91fc79221;X924d5f81d;X92ff7ef85;X95e0e9aa8;X96e7cf413;X98c30484f;X99b124329;X9b5c6782e;X9e314b754;X9f244a6c7;Xa044c4a8d;Xa403335cc;Xa418d1dc6;Xa421f8312;Xa824e0b23;Xaa47b9764;Xaba7d7d2f;Xac23ec0d2;Xae2fcec2c;Xb0b8e869d;Xb2444f695;Xb2a8140db;Xb5d71492a;Xb647f0536;Xb6b822cc9;Xb74bdbaf6;Xb78635123;Xbb149ff46;Xbb890b440;Xbcf25c772;Xc1cf6413a;Xc35a55f94;Xc3a5acdb9;Xc7e588ecc;Xc97592ee4;Xcd7c7accb;Xce01cc59f;Xceb461534;Xd1915a879;Xd54acce0b;Xdb740a271;Xdb97d5e34;Xdbc53bd54;Xdc32a33b7;Xe122d1000;Xe1b05e7f4;Xe40096f2d;Xe580c426c;Xe87bad7ff;Xe90f0314c;Xeb1306206;Xeb23b2749;Xee8f2cbfe;Xf2e535e12;Xf533c6844;Xf60cd0573;Xf7e253ebc;Xf9902ebb0;Xf9dbc47b3;Xfacf3bc21;Xfe0d3c408;Xfefe289c0;Xff7690535;Xff7dc3a6f,148,The Structure of Collaborative Tagging Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0508082,2005
1145,"Social inequality is traditionally measured by the Gini-index (g). The g-index takes values from 0 to 1 where g=0 represents complete equality and g=1 represents complete inequality. Most of the estimates of the income or wealth data indicate the g value to be widely dispersed across the countries of the world: g values typically range from 0.30 to 0.65 at a particular time (year). We estimated similarly the Gini-index for the citations earned by the yearly publications of various academic institutions and the science journals. The ISI web of science data suggests remarkably strong inequality and universality (g=0.70±0.07) across all the universities and institutions of the world, while for the journals we find g=0.65±0.15 for any typical year. We define a new inequality measure, namely the k-index, saying that the cumulative income or citations of (1-k) fraction of people or papers exceed those earned by the fraction (k) of the people or publications respectively. We find, while the k-index value for income ranges from 0.60 to 0.75 for income distributions across the world, it has a value around 0.75±0.05 for different universities and institutions across the world and around 0.77±0.10 for the science journals. Apart from above indices, we also analyze the same institution and journal citation data by measuring Pietra index and median index.","Ghosh, Asim;Chattopadhyay, Nachiketa;Chakrabarti, Bikas K.",Physica A Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,X036f6f00c;X0542c9912;X0f3b9212a;X1381d08f5;X139dabdd6;X1c1a6b187;X20bdecfc4;X216db29c5;X2c246f82d;X31db5e7df;X327368063;X3c4783afb;X3ca9d34d1;X3d61bf168;X3fd256eb5;X44913384f;X4a28fe1d1;X5e2dd4711;X62ff7fd04;X6c13d035c;X6e900e872;X7c6804b86;X8be900863;Xa0e5a1a6a;Xa22409fe2;Xa2542e027;Xa61b42da7;Xb9b9b59f6;Xbff1539f7;Xc284d5e59;Xd37d52570;Xed54abb40;Xeff200846;Xf4612f48c;Xf49b24b8a,35,"Inequality in societies, academic institutions and science journals: Gini and k-indices",http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6951,2014

1147,"Texts reveal the subjects of interest in research fields, and the values, beliefs, and practices of researchers. In this study, texts are examined through bibliometric mapping and topic modeling to provide a birds eye view of the social dynamics associated with the diffusion of research synthesis methods in the contexts of Social Work and Women's Studies. Research synthesis texts are especially revealing because the methods, which include meta-analysis and systematic review, are reliant on the availability of past research and data, sometimes idealized as objective, egalitarian approaches to research evaluation, fundamentally tied to past research practices, and performed with the goal informing future research and practice. This study highlights the co-influence of past and subsequent research within research fields; illustrates dynamics of the diffusion process; and provides insight into the cultural contexts of research in Social Work and Women's Studies. This study suggests the potential to further develop bibliometric mapping and topic modeling techniques to inform research problem selection and resource allocation.","Sheble, Laura;Chen, Annie T.",ArXiv e-prints,X00f9ecf5b;X024b1bef3;X0385786a7;X047a41074;X04ddf0b10;X0a551f0d4;X1001cc9f8;X10bbfe0e9;X1c1a330f3;X22fa9242c;X24448b4f9;X2d2959bab;X32b195ec3;X3549f0b12;X362595914;X3a1ef035b;X3c299067f;X41b9fe01b;X41ef9f77d;X43502d91d;X464f02b3c;X4bf33cba6;X4c79dfe19;X4d24634e5;X4df5e934c;X4f24e70a2;X4fada0136;X507cc253d;X531b71d08;X53345ac5f;X53bb82817;X55089b8f1;X565bd1033;X589aab5fe;X5937a49c6;X5fb15bc16;X60065be3a;X64114487d;X64a7331a8;X738c04e3b;X73c598070;X753feccaf;X7746fd6db;X7fc88b4af;X8224568b1;X82bbec218;X886f8bfc8;X89e2d7215;X8d89974e6;X909422208;X92e6af908;X96733404d;X9a3f5e661;X9b7942952;X9bff601e7;Xa14d95cd2;Xb19fd9555;Xb3d2a086e;Xbc147537f;Xbea04b96a;Xc05d97a9e;Xc38e28218;Xd1438a6cf;Xd565fd6fa;Xd755a7436;Xd89dbc9f4;Xdcbeb541e;Xdde818c8f;Xdf361a74d;Xe4869c9d2;Xe57f80367;Xe5bda8eec;Xe84b77c92;Xeca112cf2;Xef75b611a;Xf02a0f3a8;Xf2ebc146b;Xf31e28f1a;Xfa96f6ec1;Xfaaff7649,80,Contexts of diffusion: Adoption of research synthesis in Social Work and Women's Studies,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7239,2014
1148,"The Agora system is a prototype ""Wiki for Formal Mathematics"", with an aim to support developing and documenting large formalizations of mathematics in a proof assistant. The functions implemented in Agora include in-browser editing, strong AI/ATP proof advice, verification, and HTML rendering. The HTML rendering contains hyperlinks and provides on-demand explanation of the proof state for each proof step. In the present paper we show the prototype Flyspeck Wiki as an instance of Agora for HOL Light formalizations. The wiki can be used for formalizations of mathematics and for writing informal wiki pages about mathematics. Such informal pages may contain islands of formal text, which is used here for providing an initial cross-linking between Hales's informal Flyspeck book, and the formal Flyspeck development. The Agora platform intends to address distributed wiki-style collaboration on large formalization projects, in particular both the aspect of immediate editing, verification and rendering of formal code, and the aspect of gradual and mutual refactoring and correspondence of the initial informal text and its formalization. Here, we highlight these features within the Flyspeck Wiki.","Tankink, Carst;Kaliszyk, Cezary;Urban, Josef;Geuvers, Herman",ArXiv e-prints,X008d87a07;X186c0c77d;X1cb09b308;X38d7ec833;X5dcee7c04;X5e5d78ad3;X65b38a1eb;X812bc3182;X8e31dd5b4;X8ec30179e;X931d6478d;Xa3fbe50bf;Xa8529ff5d;Xb37a7e697;Xb4afa6da5;Xc33dd1f54;Xd36097df5;Xffd76bd98,18,Formal Mathematics on Display: A Wiki for Flyspeck,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5710,2013

1150,"Digital repositories, either digital preservation systems or archival systems, periodically check the integrity of stored objects to assure users of their correctness. To do so, prior solutions calculate integrity metadata and require the repository to store it alongside the actual data objects. This integrity metadata is essential for regularly verifying the correctness of the stored data objects. To safeguard and detect damage to this metadata, prior solutions rely on widely visible media, that is unaffiliated third parties, to store and provide back digests of the metadata to verify it is intact. However, they do not address recovery of the integrity metadata in case of damage or attack by an adversary. In essence, they do not preserve this metadata. We introduce IntegrityCatalog, a system that collects all integrity related metadata in a single component, and treats them as first class objects, managing both their integrity and their preservation. We introduce a treap-based persistent authenticated dictionary managing arbitrary length key/value pairs, which we use to store all integrity metadata, accessible simply by object name. Additionally, IntegrityCatalog is a distributed system that includes a network protocol that manages both corruption detection and preservation of this metadata, using administrator-selected network peers with two possible roles. Verifiers store and offer attestations on digests and have minimal storage requirements, while preservers efficiently synchronize a complete copy of the catalog to assist in recovery in case of a detected catalog compromise on the local system. We describe our prototype implementation of IntegrityCatalog, measure its performance empirically, and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world situations, with worst measured throughput of approximately 1K insertions per second, and 2K verified search operations per second.","Chondros, Nikos;Roussopoulos, Mema",ArXiv e-prints,54f90d8883;X004e7cb51;X040dbd8be;X78c12b5a0;X800032f71;X824cf029d;X924631783;X92dfc163a;X9647750b9;X990bb0006;Xb93e763ae;Xc5302f40d;Xdda6e2178;Xe17302de5;Xead71e115,15,A distributed Integrity Catalog for digital repositories,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1180,2014

1152,"The project presents the strategy adopted by the Rough Cilicia Archaeological Survey team for publishing its primary data and reports via three potentially transformative strategies for digital humanities: Loose coupling of digital data curation and publishing platforms. In loosely coupled systems, components share only a limited set of simple assumptions, which enables systems to evolve dynamically. Collaborative creation of map based narrative content. Connecting print scholarship (book, reports, article) to online resources via two-dimensional barcodes (2D codes) that can be printed on paper and can call up hyperlinks when scanned with a Smartphone. The three strategies are made possible by loosely coupling two autonomous services: Visible Past, dedicated to web collaboration and digital-print publishing and Open Context, which is a geo-historical data archiving and publishing service. The Rough Cilicia Archaeological Survey, Visible Past, and Open Context work together to illustrate a new genre of scholarship, which combine qualitative narratives and quantitative representations of space and social phenomena. The project provides tools for collaborative creation of rich scholarly narratives that are spatially located and for connecting print publications to the digital realm.

1154,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a tool that generates authority files to be integrated with linked data by means of learning rules. AUTHORIS is software developed to enhance authority control and information exchange among bibliographic and non-bibliographic entities. Design / methodology / approach: The article analyzes different methods previously developed for authority control as well as IFLA and ALA standards for managing bibliographic records. Semantic Web technologies are also evaluated. AUTHORIS relies on Drupal and incorporates the protocols of Dublin Core, SIOC, SKOS and FOAF. The tool has also taken into account the obsolescence of MARC and its substitution by FRBR and RDA. Its effectiveness was evaluated applying a learning test proposed by RDA. Over 80 percent of the actions were carried out correctly. Findings: The use of learning rules and the facilities of linked data make it easier for information organizations to reutilize products for authority control and distribute them in a fair and efficient manner. Research limitations / implications: The ISAD-G records were the ones presenting most errors. EAD was found to be second in the number of errors produced.

1155,"Large formal mathematical libraries consist of millions of atomic inference steps that give rise to a corresponding number of proved statements (lemmas). Analogously to the informal mathematical practice, only a tiny fraction of such statements is named and re-used in later proofs by formal mathematicians. In this work, we suggest and implement criteria defining the estimated usefulness of the HOL Light lemmas for proving further theorems. We use these criteria to mine the large inference graph of the lemmas in the HOL Light and Flyspeck libraries, adding up to millions of the best lemmas to the pool of statements that can be re-used in later proofs. We show that in combination with learning-based relevance filtering, such methods significantly strengthen automated theorem proving of new conjectures over large formal mathematical libraries such as Flyspeck.","Kaliszyk, Cezary;Urban, Josef",ArXiv e-prints,X010a61e52;X28c024107;X2f4627b83;X3c3ed4695;X526b8816c;X5e69bd18e;X6c173a8c6;X8efdf4173;Xa3fbe50bf;Xac655ecea;Xb22619700;Xd1f287e40;Xd2ed9cc64;Xdc84e4825;Xe1cfbf06c;Xe2a791d19;Xee58a62e4,17,Learning-assisted Theorem Proving with Millions of Lemmas,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3578,2014

1157,"Many emerging Web services, such as email, photo sharing, and web site archives, need to preserve large amounts of quickly-accessible data indefinitely into the future. In this paper, we make the case that these applications' demands on large scale storage systems over long time horizons require us to re-evaluate traditional storage system designs. We examine threats to long-lived data from an end-to-end perspective, taking into account not just hardware and software faults but also faults due to humans and organizations. We present a simple model of long-term storage failures that helps us reason about the various strategies for addressing these threats in a cost-effective manner. Using this model we show that the most important strategies for increasing the reliability of long-term storage are detecting latent faults quickly, automating fault repair to make it faster and cheaper, and increasing the independence of data replicas.","Baker, Mary;Shah, Mehul;Rosenthal, David S.

There are platform independent standards (SOAP, WSDL), which make the developers' task considerably easier. This article discusses how web services could be used in the context of the Virtual Observatory. We envisage a multi-layer architecture, with interoperating services. A well-designed lower layer consisting of simple, standard services implemented by most data providers will go a long way towards establishing a modular architecture. More complex applications can be built upon this core layer.

The FCD computes a similarity between two documents through an effective binary search on the intersection set between the two related dictionaries.

1163,"Modeling distributions of citations to scientific papers is crucial for understanding how science develops. However, there is a considerable empirical controversy on which statistical model fits the citation distributions best. This paper is concerned with rigorous empirical detection of power-law behaviour in the distribution of citations received by the most highly cited scientific papers. We have used a large, novel data set on citations to scientific papers published between 1998 and 2002 drawn from Scopus. The power-law model is compared with a number of alternative models using a likelihood ratio test. We have found that the power-law hypothesis is rejected for around half of the Scopus fields of science. For these fields of science, the Yule, power-law with exponential cut-off and log-normal distributions seem to fit the data better than the pure power-law model. On the other hand, when the power-law hypothesis is not rejected, it is usually empirically indistinguishable from most of the alternative models. The pure power-law model seems to be the best model only for the most highly cited papers in ""Physics and Astronomy"". Overall, our results seem to support theories implying that the most highly cited scientific papers follow the Yule, power-law with exponential cut-off or log-normal distribution. Our findings suggest also that power laws in citation distributions, when present, account only for a very small fraction of the published papers (less than 1% for most of science fields) and that the power-law scaling parameter (exponent) is substantially higher (from around 3.2 to around 4.7) than found in the older literature.","Brzezinski, Michal",ArXiv e-prints,52013bf6db;5457dc69d9;X14167dbce;X2196a6117;X238089e7c;X24a62fc20;X324ca0c10;X3674def92;X37a933c5f;X3e820ceb7;X4390dead2;X5a04023e5;X5d745b51a;X5f56720c5;X70b0148cd;X75aeefc66;X7f36f1972;X897be2f5b;X8f301427d;X904fd5a0b;X9aed82052;Xa7de30ffa;Xc33cc3b80;Xc6c1553a6;Xcddea854a;Xd54cf3f5c;Xd68ecfe76;Xdcf416fae;Xdea020f9a;Xe4c4a2357;Xfc72e5937,31,Power laws in citation distributions: Evidence from Scopus,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3890,2014

1165,"The subject of our present paper is the analysis of the origins or historical roots of the Higgs boson research from a bibliometric perspective, using a segmented regression analysis in combination with a method named reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS). Our analysis is based on the references cited in the Higgs boson publications published since 1974. The objective of our analysis consists of identifying specific individual publications in the Higgs boson research context to which the scientific community frequently had referred to. We are interested in seminal works which contributed to a high extent to the discovery of the Higgs boson. Our results show that researchers in the Higgs boson field preferably refer to more recently published papers —particularly papers published since the beginning of the sixties. For example, our analysis reveals seven major contributions which appeared within the sixties: Englert and Brout (1964), Higgs (1964, 2 papers), and Guralnik et al. (1964) on the Higgs mechanism as well as Glashow (1961), Weinberg (1967), and Salam (1968) on the unification of weak and electromagnetic interaction. Even if the Nobel Prize award highlights the outstanding importance of the work of Peter Higgs and Francois Englert, bibliometrics offer the additional possibility of getting hints to other publications in this research field (especially to historical publications), which are of vital importance from the expert point of view.","Barth, A.;Marx, W.;Bornmann, L.;Mutz, R.",European Physical Journal Plus,550f025639;X01ad0cf06;X0a45f521e;X1d087d708;X227a96405;X24f130674;X2761b0bb8;X278032e9d;X28ddeb68c;X312c05e20;X3cbcc8436;X43b934429;X45415a2b4;X483adec20;X4ce677b5f;X4d1db5b37;X4d7578d24;X5adf292ad;X5b76273db;X610bddbcb;X671d1b1bd;X68a631e18;X69b66bae1;X6b97e2487;X74464576e;X78124e0ed;X798682e20;X7de5bacd0;X84e490bb6;X8c70cc596;X8dad5ead6;X92adcd70f;X94fecfceb;X983e552f1;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa400a6a76;Xa682c149e;Xa7122a891;Xa727359e2;Xab04033de;Xad2d648f7;Xb36e7855c;Xcd984f9a6;Xd185890cd;Xde5a484dd;Xdfc02639c;Xe72737ad0;Xe8b5f14a8;Xebf41dcff;Xef1c281fa;Xf7a851140;Xfac7b23de;Xffee651de,54,On the origins and the historical roots of the Higgs boson research from a bibliometric perspective,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4223,2014
1166,"Many studies in information science have looked at the growth of science. In this study, we re-examine the question of the growth of science. To do this we (i) use current data up to publication year 2012 and (ii) analyse it across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences. Furthermore, the data are analysed with an advanced statistical technique - segmented regression analysis - which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: (1) The number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters) per publication year and (2) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We have looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis of cited references we identified three growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1% up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3% up to the period between the two world wars and 8 to 9% to 2012.","Bornmann, Lutz;Mutz, Ruediger",ArXiv e-prints,509ac2f300;5514620a3a;X00e1301ea;X02a7b695f;X033374452;X04226850f;X042975d51;X044188add;X048299ba0;X060d03424;X0654b4ce7;X06819d03a;X07bfc9ffe;X095ead30f;X09b71c6cd;X09ca891eb;X0a5de56d8;X0c12e8d42;X0c4458693;X0d59cf082;X0e2b94af5;X0ea895640;X101b9b4a0;X1038e74d9;X11c818fe5;X125322f55;X12df1aebc;X1306f43fe;X145b9a62c;X150c83ed4;X159f4f5b1;X15f25b8d5;X16ac09429;X1731fe55c;X178acc0e6;X19bf615f4;X1ac451888;X1bff47732;X1c47aacb4;X1c7126260;X1ce3d7238;X1d313fed3;X1d9ac85fd;X1f976750c;X1f9c5f355;X203281d33;X20fdcffc2;X21a59bffb;X235cdb554;X23a60c226;X254f1a66e;X2550da70b;X2610ca313;X26f931da7;X2717c47ff;X276af1755;X29173e19f;X29b00f4ac;X2b1c2d514;X2b3fd8b5e;X2c0ef526c;X2c1399681;X2c3e30b7e;X2d3306bf0;X2dacad245;X2dc0798ee;X2ef7fe3d7;X2f86fa8cf;X2fff92e36;X30303e86a;X309a84c5d;X30ddbda1b;X317b485c8;X319858d51;X31eb89ff9;X324f09da8;X32deddf96;X347bd4a35;X348814447;X367c7ad2b;X3742ec0e6;X3786c2cf9;X37a933c5f;X38614d950;X38754a010;X38d9a60dc;X396fafb3d;X3996927a8;X3c34183b5;X3c93b4843;X3ce8911be;X3d51eb1bf;X3d7ec5495;X3de05512e;X3e7aaacab;X3e820ceb7;X3e8e618dc;X3ea777959;X3ebb18fd8;X3ef218fdb;X3f33fd887;X3f52f361e;X3fa8bc021;X3fe487874;X3fe9e2a1d;X400f09be7;X418c44020;X41dbb17d6;X41f76036a;X42345df31;X43ffc5185;X44096c2b4;X44812af8a;X455c86da0;X462a4351e;X4634ca971;X480606f1e;X48b35bcf4;X492c82836;X49a5031f2;X4a52d020c;X4af95de0e;X4ba606339;X4cbd21dcc;X4d298cc7a;X4d77dbd63;X50e3b1425;X517abb73e;X51b1f4707;X52a8a6bfb;X53c7eb096;X55a7d70c9;X5654fa90c;X56efe6cdc;X5813cbe6d;X59f935c56;X5a73b2e89;X5d4355fcd;X5f56720c5;X600219974;X61e85fcdd;X62a5e895f;X6448f65d2;X649e9bfbd;X64bd81576;X64e9df28a;X66cc95323;X68db96647;X691529d8b;X69204ce82;X6930de62e;X697cb0ad8;X6b0985d95;X6c465f920;X6c74a1aa2;X6cff48dca;X6da63dddb;X6e0bacdc6;X6f2aae84a;X702b10452;X70ef490ec;X73e0f65f5;X741b36df3;X7424759a9;X7549f250d;X7701ec6ea;X772081f31;X777d9b03c;X788812485;X78df0a19a;X7956735f5;X7afecb6a1;X7b1e6de09;X7b7e4091f;X7c30e9c4a;X7c4c98d4f;X7c5500d2a;X7c7c07922;X7d1b4fa94;X7de5bacd0;X7ef1c7757;X7fa5850e9;X7fb93ef00;X8145fffba;X83d34e786;X842b4529c;X864c6c640;X8781570c3;X88fbf066b;X8971bf0d4;X8a4360422;X8bc67cba7;X8da356a22;X8e019a930;X8e84f2266;X8f8c953d1;X8fb7d37e9;X8fd0584df;X902cb7769;X91889ec33;X92493e678;X932c2485f;X945d5fcbd;X94ff1abe8;X95a57fa7d;X95afb2ad7;X96d72eeb0;X970a9c2a4;X972627bfe;X97ea6943e;X9a55135a9;X9bc2e85d9;X9c8eee6c3;X9c9e3085f;X9cce8c33f;Xa09800b8d;Xa0b9fbd3a;Xa1b994b71;Xa212c8ee5;Xa2485c8f6;Xa2766c7b6;Xa28185d89;Xa2c65734a;Xa314e8d0f;Xa34883729;Xa418d1dc6;Xa49ed5dab;Xa4a8ac029;Xa5789e221;Xa6483bf5a;Xa6d8c5624;Xa6f4f1688;Xa7628afa2;Xa837b3353;Xa85e95f91;Xa86117ac4;Xa91731636;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xab2205eb5;Xab9912a64;Xabd85ddec;Xac5fd3e60;Xaef66d397;Xaf1d4d89d;Xb17fcb09b;Xb35ee8e1c;Xb3e6f9ed8;Xb43d2a204;Xb5069b73a;Xb9720b57e;Xb9b9b59f6;Xbb6d9bb83;Xbd20432c1;Xbde2153e9;Xbe4e39122;Xbeb63e0bf;Xbf7c2fd23;Xc01c401e7;Xc03f942e7;Xc0aac609a;Xc10942078;Xc1b4139d4;Xc28b8aa04;Xc2c53801d;Xc33cc3b80;Xc3b29cae3;Xc409dc8f4;Xc6ce0302c;Xc735cf7b1;Xc7ac31402;Xc8edb856f;Xc91888512;Xcbdc8920e;Xcc3e03249;Xcc7e2c4e5;Xcf3bda45b;Xd00ddc803;Xd1b048e81;Xd238e5371;Xd306856b8;Xd3150dc10;Xd404b734b;Xd4d9dfdb2;Xd5782784e;Xd5cba566c;Xd5d9794c5;Xd62c4b37f;Xd646719be;Xd69b98c13;Xd6a214e66;Xd796f932b;Xd82fe801c;Xd8fdc95af;Xda0ccbd32;Xdaad651e9;Xdad6086b8;Xdbac42175;Xdc05b5153;Xde640f429;Xdeb282254;Xdf32da57a;Xdf40be0a1;Xdf54afe8f;Xdf9b9ee45;Xe0a999dd5;Xe0aea11b7;Xe0d2ba05b;Xe11fbbf9d;Xe424afdea;Xe4827e9b2;Xe5fd91681;Xe63427442;Xe67aec766;Xe7ee7e868;Xe92c291c0;Xeafa32e62;Xec4cb320f;Xec4eeb551;Xec7b8a5f1;Xede143ca8;Xee2633674;Xee356adb0;Xee40a9b40;Xee61b654e;Xef1c281fa;Xef585ca0c;Xf07a58cad;Xf0fffcbf7;Xf1940d2c0;Xf24e24303;Xf33d97589;Xf35508cd0;Xf381e4948;Xf49d1e66d;Xf5a7c74c3;Xf5fc921ee;Xf701d5c2e;Xf7bca8758;Xf8e502f51;Xfa411e2c8;Xfafba696d;Xfbb01450a;Xfc2c8d970;Xfc69790db;Xfcdbfc184;Xfe4f2aa52;Xfe5ba3589;Xfe862e680;Xff7690535;Xffe051109,350,Growth rates of modern science: A bibliometric analysis based on the number of publications and cited references,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4578,2014
1167,"In this paper an analysis of the presence and possibilities of altmetrics for bibliometric and performance analysis is carried out. Using the web based tool Impact Story, we collected metrics for 20,000 random publications from the Web of Science. We studied both the presence and distribution of altmetrics in the set of publications, across fields, document types and over publication years, as well as the extent to which altmetrics correlate with citation indicators. The main result of the study is that the altmetrics source that provides the most metrics is Mendeley, with metrics on readerships for 62.6% of all the publications studied, other sources only provide marginal information. In terms of relation with citations, a moderate spearman correlation (r=0.49) has been found between Mendeley readership counts and citation indicators. Other possibilities and limitations of these indicators are discussed and future research lines are outlined.","Zahedi, Zohreh;Costas, Rodrigo;Wouters, Paul",ArXiv e-prints,54b2880280;X0954e8445;X0f51d5603;X14253e345;X26405fef7;X27c54faab;X2b70e1bf4;X2f0796df0;X301c4f561;X33218a7e7;X3996927a8;X3e076cd02;X3e5f94fd8;X47a1c8bf3;X4c94bd3c5;X4eeca04b7;X59d20f86c;X5f0a07943;X68b289102;X6c74a1aa2;X7bd6dcf35;X7d3f03970;X815a3bcf4;X889f75268;X88fbf066b;X8a4a3b82f;X8d2d73929;X8f546fb94;X9156758d1;X94ba7afb2;X951024f8f;X9917452c8;X9ff0a4a55;Xa1b994b71;Xabb33868f;Xac9f6334a;Xb0b6151d7;Xb42cd10be;Xb694d6f1e;Xb7a27e3b9;Xc1f6bbbf5;Xc41aa81d4;Xc657f4d84;Xcddea854a;Xcf05afb96;Xd79c1acf0;Xd86e42a79;Xd98237bd8;Xde26cff03;Xe16b1e17b;Xe6a65c186;Xf1b098cb3,52,How well developed are altmetrics?

1169,"The historical, cultural, and intellectual importance of archiving the web has been widely recognized. Today, all countries with high Internet penetration rate have established high-profile archiving initiatives to crawl and archive the fast-disappearing web content for long-term use. As web technologies evolve, established web archiving techniques face challenges. This paper focuses on the potential impact of the relaxed consistency web design on crawler driven web archiving. Relaxed consistent websites may disseminate, albeit ephemerally, inaccurate and even contradictory information. If captured and preserved in the web archives as historical records, such information will degrade the overall archival quality. To assess the extent of such quality degradation, we build a simplified feed-following application and simulate its operation with synthetic workloads. The results indicate that a non-trivial portion of a relaxed consistency web archive may contain observable inconsistency, and the inconsistency window may extend significantly longer than that observed at the data store. We discuss the nature of such quality degradation and propose a few possible remedies.","Xie, Zhiwu;Van de Sompel, Herbert;Liu, Jinyang;van Reenen, Johann;Jordan, Ramiro",ArXiv e-prints,X0ddbe4ec7;X1a5ebf527;X39acd2104;X7fee89251;X9898ffe69;Xa7a1e238e;Xa8f8ba34c;Xa92fbaa0f;Xc0f1827f5;Xcd87b7d82;Xf18b22127,11,Archiving the Relaxed Consistency Web,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2433,2013
1170,"The journal impact factor is not comparable among fields of science and social science because of systematic differences in publication and citation behaviour across disciplines. In this work, a source normalization of the journal impact factor is proposed. We use the aggregate impact factor of the citing journals as a measure of the citation potential in the journal topic, and we employ this citation potential in the normalization of the journal impact factor to make it comparable between scientific fields. An empirical application comparing some impact indicators with our topic normalized impact factor in a set of 224 journals from four different fields shows that our normalization, using the citation potential in the journal topic, reduces the between-group variance with respect to the within-group variance in a higher proportion than the rest of indicators analysed. The effect of journal self-citations over the normalization process is also studied.","Dorta-Gonzalez, Pablo;Dorta-Gonzalez, Maria Isabel;Rosa Santos-Penate, Dolores;Suarez-Vega, Rafael",ArXiv e-prints,X03ef360a9;X31502dafe;X3dcd92fbc;X652e41e00;X78544abde;X9529efed8;Xa1b994b71;Xa4d0d4979;Xaa384bd3e;Xaeb23e849;Xb13fa511d;Xbc7245404;Xc6d82030e;Xc990a8e79;Xd7215d9c8;Xe2d35eaf5,16,Journal topic citation potential and between-field comparisons: The topic normalized impact factor,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6317,2014
1171,"We present a method for hierarchic categorization and taxonomy evolution description. We focus on the structure of epistemic communities (ECs), or groups of agents sharing common knowledge concerns. Introducing a formal framework based on Galois lattices, we categorize ECs in an automated and hierarchically structured way and propose criteria for selecting the most relevant epistemic communities - for instance, ECs gathering a certain proportion of agents and thus prototypical of major fields. This process produces a manageable, insightful taxonomy of the community. Then, the longitudinal study of these static pictures makes possible an historical description. In particular, we capture stylized facts such as field progress, decline, specialization, interaction (merging or splitting), and paradigm emergence. The detection of such patterns in social networks could fruitfully be applied to other contexts.","Roth, Camille;Bourgine, Paul",ArXiv e-prints,X0fc190096;X3d731c2f7;X887b89239,3,"Lattices for Dynamic, Hierarchic & Overlapping Categorization: the Case of Epistemic Communities",http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0509007,2005
1172,"We present the problem of finding comparable researchers for any given researcher. This problem has many motivations. Firstly, know thyself. The answers of where we stand among research community and who we are most alike may not be easily found by existing evaluations of ones' research mainly based on citation counts. Secondly, there are many situations where one needs to find comparable researchers e.g., for reviewing peers, constructing programming committees or compiling teams for grants. It is often done through an ad hoc and informal basis. Utilizing the large scale scholarly data accessible on the web, we address the problem of automatically finding comparable researchers. We propose a standard to quantify the quality of research output, via the quality of publishing venues. We represent a researcher as a sequence of her publication records, and develop a framework of comparison of researchers by sequence matching. Several variations of comparisons are considered including matching by quality of publication venue and research topics, and performing prefix matching. We evaluate our methods on a large corpus and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through examples. In the end, we identify several promising directions for further work.","Cormode, Graham;Muthukrishnan, S.;Yan, Jinyun",ArXiv e-prints,X13ade99df;X1aa857b6a;X4aa3b9d03;X4de1763a1;X56182d95b;X612edf0c3;X86541d563;Xa8f8ba34c;Xb543e8268;Xda6b05033;Xdcabef34d;Xddd996ee9;Xea100c465;Xecfc670cc;Xf0cf69adc,15,People Like Us: Mining Scholarly Data for Comparable Researchers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2941,2014
1173,"At the very center of digital mathematics libraries lie controlled vocabularies which qualify the {\it topic} of the documents. These topics are used when submitting a document to a digital mathematics library and to perform searches in a library. The latter are refined by the use of these topics as they allow a precise classification of the mathematics area this document addresses. However, there is a major risk that users employ too precise topics to specify their queries: they may be employing a topic that is only ""close-by"" but missing to match the right resource. We call this the {\it topic trap}. Indeed, since 2009, this issue has appeared frequently on the i2geo.net platform. Other mathematics portals experience the same phenomenon. An approach to solve this issue is to introduce tolerance in the way queries are understood by the user. In particular, the approach of including fuzzy matches but this introduces noise which may prevent the user of understanding the function of the search engine. In this paper, we propose a way to escape the topic trap by employing the navigation between related topics and the count of search results for each topic. This supports the user in that search for close-by topics is a click away from a previous search. This approach was realized with the i2geo search engine and is described in detail where the relation of being {\it related} is computed by employing textual analysis of the definitions of the concepts fetched from the Wikipedia encyclopedia.","Libbrecht, Paul",ArXiv e-prints,X00c44a80d;X2d2c07287;X4ba254738;X5ac216cc7;X5ef428c7c;X632e460e9;X74305638d;Xa111d1a5a;Xd3d55acd5,9,Escaping the Trap of too Precise Topic Queries,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5724,2013
1174,"We address the question to what extent the success of scientific articles is due to social influence. Analyzing a data set of over 100000 publications from the field of Computer Science, we study how centrality in the coauthorship network differs between authors who have highly cited papers and those who do not. We further show that a machine learning classifier, based only on coauthorship network centrality measures at time of publication, is able to predict with high precision whether an article will be highly cited five years after publication. By this we provide quantitative insight into the social dimension of scientific publishing - challenging the perception of citations as an objective, socially unbiased measure of scientific success.","Sarigöl, Emre;Pfitzner, Rene;Scholtes, Ingo;Garas, Antonios;Schweitzer, Frank",ArXiv e-prints,509ac2f300;52c5bf8692;54b9248348;X0599c8326;X0b559beb5;X0c31825db;X1263f6d8f;X178acc0e6;X1aee901ed;X1ccdb2e71;X1d1e9321e;X1d90e9973;X21635989e;X25f52bec3;X29aeee351;X321ced0b2;X348d1b5df;X393b3314e;X47036af01;X4d284067e;X4ea4468b2;X4ec94833f;X53e89ab94;X54b2a49ee;X570c56f2a;X57360c633;X5bde6df68;X5c5d0b84e;X5d5244ff8;X695121270;X69e140b5b;X6db9dd795;X74444778e;X74d6d72e5;X776244a63;X79de521bf;X7c7c07922;X81c0f8602;X82f52bb9f;X878c61a63;X8b34c602c;X8f546fb94;X9226bc074;X950255edf;X978302929;X9ac3c6ae0;X9c5849a60;Xa280db30b;Xa2c3cb6c4;Xa4bae469d;Xa507828fd;Xa8c7e9522;Xa91527dd6;Xab01a1fa1;Xacc783b3f;Xad66e866e;Xb0835bac8;Xb52b0e0bf;Xbb12c5e5c;Xbc815d6b1;Xbe66a8385;Xc282bfdca;Xc58da5eb4;Xc864cfacf;Xccf78e5b8;Xce9518275;Xd55ac1b3b;Xdad6086b8;Xdd3ac0453;Xde82e1ec9;Xe6474836b;Xe6c5caa94;Xec02a9f7d;Xec9af3aea;Xf0f746953;Xf2c0517a7;Xf35508cd0;Xf813c1484;Xf9673633f;Xfbdffdaee;Xffc538ae9,81,Predicting Scientific Success Based on Coauthorship Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.7268,2014
1175,"Multimedia educational resources play an important role in education, particularly for distance learning environments. With the rapid growth of the multimedia web, large numbers of education articles video resources are increasingly being created by several different organizations. It is crucial to explore, share, reuse, and link these educational resources for better e-learning experiences. Most of the video resources are currently annotated in an isolated way, which means that they lack semantic connections. Thus, providing the facilities for annotating these video resources is highly demanded. These facilities create the semantic connections among video resources and allow their metadata to be understood globally. Adopting Linked Data technology, this paper introduces a video annotation and browser platform with two online tools: Notitia and Sansu-Wolke. Notitia enables users to semantically annotate video resources using vocabularies defined in the Linked Data cloud.

1176,"Plagiarism is one of the growing issues in academia and is always a concern in Universities and other academic institutions. The situation is becoming even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on creating an effective and fast tool for plagiarism detection for text based electronic assignments. Our plagiarism detection tool named AntiPlag is developed using the tri-gram sequence matching technique. Three sets of text based assignments were tested by AntiPlag and the results were compared against an existing commercial plagiarism detection tool. AntiPlag showed better results in terms of false positives compared to the commercial tool due to the pre-processing steps performed in AntiPlag. In addition, to improve the detection latency, AntiPlag applies a data clustering technique making it four times faster than the commercial tool considered. AntiPlag could be used to isolate plagiarized text based assignments from non-plagiarised assignments easily. Therefore, we present AntiPlag, a fast and effective tool for plagiarism detection on text based electronic assignments.","Jiffriya, M. A. C.;Akmal Jahan, M. A. C.;Ragel, R.

1177,"Accurately segmenting a citation string into fields for authors, titles, etc. is a challenging task because the output typically obeys various global constraints. Previous work has shown that modeling soft constraints, where the model is encouraged, but not require to obey the constraints, can substantially improve segmentation performance. On the other hand, for imposing hard constraints, dual decomposition is a popular technique for efficient prediction given existing algorithms for unconstrained inference. We extend the technique to perform prediction subject to soft constraints. Moreover, with a technique for performing inference given soft constraints, it is easy to automatically generate large families of constraints and learn their costs with a simple convex optimization problem during training. This allows us to obtain substantial gains in accuracy on a new, challenging citation extraction dataset.","Anzaroot, Sam;Passos, Alexandre;Belanger, David;McCallum, Andrew",ArXiv e-prints,X04bcf3257;X0a067c4aa;X109420f77;X1240aac24;X14ee48515;X17e1d0411;X2347d0854;X2500611ac;X2732c9ea1;X29ab49157;X2c93db767;X3e96a80f9;X4a9ca096b;X510400d0e;X5724ad380;X575785965;X5a9657cf5;X5c7113827;X63d4f8bf8;X71a1e6adf;X74cce6577;X773f241af;X8aeadcbd9;X8b5641bb0;X9077c69ec;X90b8d71e3;X92024cb4c;X985ced3b3;X9868f667f;X9e3290a72;Xa1d7b19e8;Xaa5183834;Xba1165642;Xd1787d8f9;Xd72daa0f9;Xd83103ee3;Xeac2f9c20;Xebb2fe5fa;Xee29ed786;Xfb2695358,40,Learning Soft Linear Constraints with Application to Citation Field Extraction,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1349,2014
1178,"We study the statistics of citations made to the top ranked indexed journals for Science and Social Science databases in the Journal Citation Reports using different measures. Total annual citation and impact factor, as well as a third measure called the annual citation rate are used to make the detailed analysis. We observe that the distribution of the annual citation rate has an universal feature - it shows a maximum at the rate scaled by half the average, irrespective of how the journals are ranked, and even across Science and Social Science journals, and fits well to log-Gumbel distribution. Correlations between different quantities are studied and a comparative analysis of the three measures is presented. The newly introduced annual citation rate factor helps in understanding the effect of scaling the number of citation by the total number of publications. The effect of the impact factor on authors contributing to the journals as well as on editorial policies is also discussed.","Khaleque, Abdul;Chatterjee, Arnab;Sen, Parongama",ArXiv e-prints,X06f1b19a0;X796f0aab9;X9dfc983e9;X9fae4b7d2;Xbc2cd2cfd;Xc6d82030e;Xc898f58a6;Xca4a15c6d;Xe719e0458;Xe9408c614;Xf62cd6b74,11,On the evolution and utility of annual citation indices,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1745,2014
1179,"This work introduces the R package RefManageR, which provides tools for importing and working with bibliographic references. It extends the bibentry class in R in a number of useful ways, including providing R with previously unavailable support for BibLaTeX. BibLaTeX provides a superset of the functionality of BibTeX, including full Unicode support, no memory limitations, additional fields and entry types, and more sophisticated sorting of references. RefManageR provides functions for citing and generating a bibliography with hyperlinks for documents prepared with RMarkdown or RHTML. Existing .bib files can be read into R and converted from BibTeX to BibLaTeX and vice versa. References can also be imported via queries to NCBI's Entrez, Zotero libraries, Google Scholar, and CrossRef. Additionally, references can be created by reading PDFs stored on the user's machine with the help of Poppler. Entries stored in the reference manager can be easily searched by any field, by date ranges, and by various formats for name lists (author by last names, translator by full names, etc.). Entries can also be updated, combined, sorted, printed in a number of styles, and exported.","McLean, Mathew W.",ArXiv e-prints,X049c3b425;X0897744e8;X09643f696;X0b6b34687;X1226fe79a;X12374e272;X12f8a302a;X13134c98b;X13eebb7a1;X17e1d0411;X1c5a7018e;X1e144dba3;X2256dc8ad;X25830f5c4;X2ab400ccf;X2b37aa989;X2b9117527;X2df4e4190;X349c8412b;X38d7ec833;X395321326;X3a01366b1;X3c82c4787;X3daeafa14;X3f72d8f21;X415a5e95f;X41f35771a;X4c8c95dab;X4f2edb087;X502244fac;X56ab5a6ba;X5891891ba;X5e1b5eb04;X5f56720c5;X5f8b44a5e;X6426bc032;X678b690a8;X695daf984;X6c1103640;X6ce3c596e;X74eb465dd;X75a4eb49c;X767c18ed7;X7c54358fd;X7d974ef0f;X81587a1a7;X851e1d1fa;X86f00cc18;X87f058787;X931375941;X9aefafdab;X9f7560b0c;Xa707dabe2;Xacf2f2896;Xb16e16511;Xb92c18923;Xbae92827d;Xbff3e5fe8;Xc2fff1b33;Xc369f5355;Xc3d048cce;Xc6e97efe5;Xc8ed850be;Xcb1ba0417;Xcb2a15866;Xcbfcd6fd7;Xcc7c33a6c;Xcca209e22;Xd35c858a3;Xe450803cf;Xeff8ad09f;Xf7a8d5674;Xfd7349aeb,73,Straightforward Bibliography Management in R with the RefManageR Package,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2036,2014
1180,"In contrast to many other scientific disciplines, computer science considers conference publications. Conferences have the advantage of providing fast publication of papers and of bringing researchers together to present and discuss the paper with peers. Previous work on knowledge mapping focused on the map of all sciences or a particular domain based on ISI published JCR (Journal Citation Report). Although this data covers most of important journals, it lacks computer science conference and workshop proceedings. That results in an imprecise and incomplete analysis of the computer science knowledge. This paper presents an analysis on the computer science knowledge network constructed from all types of publications, aiming at providing a complete view of computer science research. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries (DBLP and CiteSeerX), we study the knowledge network created at journal/conference level using citation linkage, to identify the development of sub-disciplines. We investigate the collaborative and citation behavior of journals/conferences by analyzing the properties of their co-authorship and citation subgraphs. The paper draws several important conclusions. First, conferences constitute social structures that shape the computer science knowledge. Second, computer science is becoming more interdisciplinary. Third, experts are the key success factor for sustainability of journals/conferences.","Cuong Pham, Manh;Klamma, Ralf;Jarke, Matthias",ArXiv e-prints,X00d4b9697;X02f7742b3;X0b9ed4033;X0bf9227b5;X11a1226ae;X1403eac86;X172ddd2e6;X1ce601a99;X1d9dc3fc1;X218322de0;X251137045;X3b08a84a2;X55cadb12e;X61e85fcdd;X719943a12;X92812cd4c;X938b29472;X98dd7a135;X9bacaaf39;Xa1b994b71;Xa94a81680;Xaa4e3e4de;Xb2fdb4c8e;Xca3bbeba4;Xd47aa7829;Xd56a65d51;Xd7793984f;Xdbce324b9;Xe1b1c61e7;Xe2b38d964,30,Development of Computer Science Disciplines - A Social Network Analysis Approach,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1977,2011

The community has settled on a copyright and license policy that suits the peculiar features of Mizar and its community. In this paper we discuss the copyright and license solutions.

1182,"The present paper extends the literature investigating key drivers leading certain patents to exert a stronger influence on the subsequent technological developments (inventions) than other ones. We investigated six key determinants, as (i) the use of scientific knowledge, (ii) the breadth of the technological base, (iii) the existence of collaboration in patent development, (iv) the number of claims, (v) the scope, and (vi) the novelty, and how the effect of these determinants varies when patent influence - as measured by the number of forward citations the patent received - is distinguished as within and across the industrial and organizational boundaries. We conducted an empirical analysis on a sample of 5671 patents granted to 293 US biotechnology firms from 1976 to 2003. Results reveal that the contribution of the determinants to patent influence differs across the domains that are identified by the industrial and organizational boundaries. Findings, for example, show that the use of scientific knowledge negatively affects patent influence outside the biotechnology industry, while it positively contributes to make a patent more relevant for the assignee's subsequent technological developments. In addition, the broader the scope of a patent the higher the number of citations the patent receives from subsequent non-biotechnology patents. This relationship is inverted-U shaped when considering the influence of a patent on inventions granted to other organizations than the patent's assignee. Finally, the novelty of a patent is inverted-U related with the influence the patent exerts on the subsequent inventions granted across the industrial and organizational boundaries.","Messeni Petruzzelli, Antonio;Rotolo, Daniele;Albino, Vito",ArXiv e-prints,X0008ea633;X05d428a49;X075e10287;X2192c9705;X21afe7b20;X295db91e5;X2a8b8ebcd;X2f41780f5;X32cdc9799;X398541cbd;X442d0aaf5;X4840dba7d;X4f77b38ec;X53120b010;X55ff57b1c;X58aad27ad;X5c67d020d;X5e9731b3b;X6918db166;X6aa1af2f7;X711020fc7;X716ec96de;X744b4add1;X7505ad3e7;X7793f5670;X78d6c882d;X7b3e04792;X896135ecc;X8c446fdca;X8f5817480;X937a3501e;X967f04c7d;X96f2e38b3;X995b55779;X9ac3c6ae0;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa98db9e90;Xabdcc3259;Xac2a74432;Xaffdc3459;Xbe4e39122;Xc15a50ae4;Xc21328983;Xd1e6e283c;Xd9d65d6f8;Xecd4fa3e7;Xed8248ba3;Xf10ddcc1f;Xf3020d54c;Xf8ec30fa9;Xfd3735e02,52,Determinants of Patent Citations in Biotechnology: An Analysis of Patent Influence Across the Industrial and Organizational Boundaries,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2096,2014

1186,"Twenty-five years ago the desktop computer started becoming ubiquitous in the scientific lab. Researchers were delighted with its ability to both control instrumentation and acquire data on a single system, but they were not completely satisfied. There were often gaps in knowledge that they thought might be gained if they just had more data and they could get the data faster. Computer technology has evolved in keeping with Moore's Law meeting those desires; however those improvement have of late become both a boon and bane for researchers. Computers are now capable of producing high speed data streams containing terabytes of information; capabilities that evolved faster than envisioned last century. Software to handle large scientific data sets has not kept up. How much information might be lost through accidental mismanagement or how many discoveries are missed through data overload are now vital questions. An important new task in most scientific disciplines involves developing methods to address those issues and to create software that can handle large data sets with an eye towards scalability. This software must create archived, indexed, and searchable data from heterogeneous instrumentation for the implementation of a strong data-driven materials development strategy. At the National Center for Photovoltaics in the National Renewable Energy Lab, we began development a few years ago on a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) designed to handle lab-wide scientific data acquisition, management, processing, and mining needs for physics and materials science data. and with a specific focus on future scalability for new equipment or research focuses.

1187,"Classifying researchers according to the quality of their published work rather than the quantity is a curtail issue. We attempt to introduce a new formula of the percentage range to be used for evaluating qualitatively the researchers' production. The suggested equation depends on the number of the single-author published papers and their citations to be added as a new factor to the known h-index. These factors give an advantage and make a clear evidence of innovative authors and reduce the known h-index for authors who are gaining citations by adding their names to multi-author papers.

1188,"Research teams are the fundamental social unit of science, and yet there is currently no model that describes their basic property: size. In most fields teams have grown significantly in recent decades. We show that this is partly due to the change in the character of team-size distribution. We explain these changes with a comprehensive yet straightforward model of how teams of different sizes emerge and grow. This model accurately reproduces the evolution of empirical team-size distribution over the period of 50 years. The modeling reveals that there are two modes of knowledge production. The first and more fundamental mode employs relatively small, core teams. Core teams form by a Poisson process and produce a Poisson distribution of team sizes in which larger teams are exceedingly rare. The second mode employs extended teams, which started as core teams, but subsequently accumulated new members proportional to the past productivity of their members. Given time, this mode gives rise to a power-law tail of large teams (10-1000 members), which features in many fields today. Based on this model we construct an analytical functional form that allows the contribution of different modes of authorship to be determined directly from the data and is applicable to any field. The model also offers a solid foundation for studying other social aspects of science, such as productivity and collaboration.","Milojević, Staša",ArXiv e-prints,X0da246d00;X1f6a54d26;X293ab6c4e;X2e075986d;X31c6a769b;X358490012;X3780bb2be;X3ebb18fd8;X4151b0c59;X4abb92adb;X4b371285d;X4bc77c23a;X69f1f87c4;X6d6fc2c93;X75aeefc66;X89b020fb7;X99226e243;X9f8331528;Xb427930e3;Xb653ec8bb;Xb903f0e80;Xd70ff59ea;Xdf793b056;Xe4bac972a;Xf28229fa2;Xfacf3bc21,26,Principles of scientific research team formation and evolution,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2787,2014
1189,"Do different fields of knowledge require different research strategies? A numerical model exploring different virtual knowledge landscapes, revealed two diverging optimal search strategies. Trend following is maximized when the popularity of new discoveries determine the number of individuals researching it. This strategy works best when many researchers explore few large areas of knowledge. In contrast, individuals or small groups of researchers are better in discovering small bits of information in dispersed knowledge landscapes. Bibliometric data of scientific publications showed a continuous bipolar distribution of these strategies, ranging from natural sciences, with highly cited publications in journals containing a large number of articles, to the social sciences, with rarely cited publications in many journals containing a small number of articles. The natural sciences seem to adapt their research strategies to landscapes with large concentrated knowledge clusters, whereas social sciences seem to have adapted to search in landscapes with many small isolated knowledge clusters. Similar bipolar distributions were obtained when comparing levels of insularity estimated by indicators of international collaboration and levels of country-self citations: researchers in academic areas with many journals such as social sciences, arts and humanities, were the most isolated, and that was true in different regions of the world. The work shows that quantitative measures estimating differences between academic disciplines improve our understanding of different research strategies, eventually helping interdisciplinary research and may be also help improve science policies worldwide.","Jaffe, Klaus",PLoS ONE,X0256e3c94;X084434cc8;X11fba4f79;X15693126c;X15b817b30;X1a11d778f;X1a5fbccfb;X2ef7fe3d7;X35695d58a;X3900d3b76;X39d604195;X3d3ad9b79;X3d880e8de;X43eaadd5a;X455fd7d64;X467f65af6;X4a2a477b5;X4e78c86eb;X4ff868cee;X571834f20;X595119947;X5b28c2b32;X6049026c5;X61c3343de;X670dcdcaa;X73a129865;X74816cc34;X785262942;X792f06d51;X811b306ba;X817f74568;X84945b755;X85bcd142e;X87c46fcc5;X88c401792;X88cde0e80;X8b0ebe159;X8b45a7ce6;X9294af32f;X96e33ceb2;X99fa40989;X9e71fed94;Xa78f7abdb;Xabeadc8da;Xb0c5c57e2;Xb19dd6a6e;Xb7b920db6;Xb91a2f067;Xc3be9664c;Xcbfb3a18b;Xccd88aa61;Xd1fe4279d;Xd5b6cff1c;Xdc9e22c30;Xe368004b5;Xe995c04e9;Xf255ccc9a;Xf4f646e79;Xff8bd9a21,59,"Social and Natural Sciences Differ in Their Research Strategies, Adapted to Work for Different Knowledge Landscapes",http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5107,2014

1195,"Peer review is the backbone of modern science. F1000Prime is a post-publication peer review system of the biomedical literature (papers from medical and biological journals). This study is concerned with the inter-rater reliability and convergent validity of the peer recommendations formulated in the F1000Prime peer review system. The study is based on around 100,000 papers with recommendations from Faculty members. Even if intersubjectivity plays a fundamental role in science, the analyses of the reliability of the F1000Prime peer review system show a rather low level of agreement between Faculty members. This result is in agreement with most other studies which have been published on the journal peer review system. Logistic regression models are used to investigate the convergent validity of the F1000Prime peer review system. As the results show, the proportion of highly cited papers among those selected by the Faculty members is significantly higher than expected.

1196,"The gradual crowding out of singleton and small team science by large team endeavors is challenging key features of research culture. It is therefore important for the future of scientific practice to reflect upon the individual scientist's ethical responsibilities within teams. To facilitate this reflection we show labor force trends in the US revealing a skewed growth in academic ranks and increased levels of competition for promotion within the system; we analyze teaming trends across disciplines and national borders demonstrating why it is becoming difficult to distribute credit and to avoid conflicts of interest; and we use more than a century of Nobel prize data to show how science is outgrowing its old institutions of singleton awards. Of particular concern within the large team environment is the weakening of the mentor-mentee relation, which undermines the cultivation of virtue ethics across scientific generations. These trends and emerging organizational complexities call for a universal set of behavioral norms that transcend team heterogeneity and hierarchy. To this end, our expository analysis provides a survey of ethical issues in team settings to inform science ethics education and science policy.","Petersen, Alexander M.;Pavlidis, Ioannis;Semendeferi, Ioanna",ArXiv e-prints,X02edfc5b9;X0b559beb5;X1284e9d56;X19a0402e4;X1ec017248;X30f46f52f;X33218a7e7;X483e0d846;X54c1312b2;X56b9e693b;X5ac7cbda1;X695121270;X703bd0044;X719a1f634;X7fe91ba72;X8b274cdd8;X8b292d585;X8ea7c86c0;X9405b0302;X96c887915;Xa84b72a77;Xb6dd33b98;Xb721f54ac;Xb973dc8ad;Xc42fb7445;Xc5663c042;Xc93cf9a53;Xca941bec9;Xd40bd03d5;Xd87e007e5;Xd98b134a2;Xe0a66dd28;Xe4510c596;Xea5f9161f;Xee72c5f84;Xf3ea58790;Xf7713dc80,37,A quantitative perspective on ethics in large team science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0191,2014
1197,"Many different measures are used to assess academic research excellence and these are subject to ongoing discussion and debate within the scientometric, university-management and policy-making communities internationally. One topic of continued importance is the extent to which citation-based indicators compare with peer-review-based evaluation. Here we analyse the correlations between values of a particular citation-based impact indicator and peer-review scores in several academic disciplines, from natural to social sciences and humanities. We perform the comparison for research groups rather than for individuals. We make comparisons on two levels. At an absolute level, we compare total impact and overall strength of the group as a whole. At a specific level, we compare academic impact and quality, normalised by the size of the group. We find very high correlations at the former level for some disciplines and poor correlations at the latter level for all disciplines. This means that, although the citation-based scores could help to describe research-group strength, in particular for the so-called hard sciences, they should not be used as a proxy for ranking or comparison of research groups. Moreover, the correlation between peer-evaluated and citation-based scores is weaker for soft sciences.","Mryglod, O.;Kenna, R.;Holovatch, Yu.;Berche, B.",ArXiv e-prints,5509040b97;X0368a8d58;X06ca0c0ca;X0885ddc94;X20f19cd8d;X299ad1a42;X2b3aeea33;X4401b1f98;X44a9c84c8;X44bb3bab9;X7549f250d;X8019f7279;X92fba0127;X99e776f8d;Xa1b994b71;Xad7ebf6fb;Xf9669f57f,17,Comparison of a citation-based indicator and peer review for absolute and specific measures of research-group excellence,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6256,2013

1200,"The percentages of shares of world publications of the European Union and its member states, China, and the United States have been represented differently as a result of using different databases. An analytical variant of the Web-of-Science (of Thomson Reuters) enables us to study the dynamics in the world publication system in terms of the field-normalized top-1% and top-10% most-frequently-cited publications. Comparing the EU28, USA, and China at the global level shows a top-level dynamics that is different from the analysis in terms of shares of publications: the United States remains far more productive in the top-1% of all papers; China drops out of the competition for elite status; and the EU28 increased its share among the top-cited papers from 2000-2010. Some of the EU28 member states overtook the U.S. during this decade, but a clear divide remains between EU15 (Western Europe) and the Accession Countries. Network analysis shows that internationally co-authored top-1% publications perform far above expectation and also above top-10% ones. In 2005, China was embedded in this top-layer of internationally co-authored publications. These publications often involve more than a single European nation.","Leydesdorff, Loet;Wagner, Caroline S.;Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X0f16867ac;X11857df50;X1354956cb;X18d8fbf1f;X1b1505512;X1c230ce67;X20ade0ad1;X330bc455d;X33218a7e7;X3692a603e;X3cfa443fd;X54365f80c;X67a98271b;X7399bfa6a;X78c4096f4;X7c7c07922;X82f52bb9f;X868e11c94;X995412727;X9b9a40bb2;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xaefaec36b;Xbe4e39122;Xd58c14f50;Xded43d630;Xdfcb6d974;Xe929e9b50;Xf22869ed5,29,"The European Union, China, and the United States in the Top-1% and Top-10% Layers of Most-Frequently-Cited Publications: Competition and Collaborations",http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0462,2014

1202,"The Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) is a rich database of formalized mathematical proofs (see http://mizar.org). Owing to its large size (it contains more than 1100 ""articles"" summing to nearly 2.5 million lines of text, expressing more than 50000 theorems and 10000 definitions using more than 7000 symbols), the nature of its contents (the MML is slanted toward pure mathematics), and its classical foundations (first-order logic, set theory, natural deduction), the MML is an especially attractive target for research on foundations of mathematics. We have implemented a system, mizar-items, on which a variety of such foundational experiements can be based. The heart of mizar-items is a method for decomposing the contents of the MML into fine-grained ""items"" (e.g., theorem, definition, notation, etc.) and computing dependency relations among these items. mizar-items also comes equipped with a website for exploring these dependencies and interacting with them.","Alama, Jesse",ArXiv e-prints,,0,mizar-items: Exploring fine-grained dependencies in the Mizar Mathematical Library,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4721,2011
1203,"We compare the network of aggregated journal-journal citation relations provided by the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) 2012 of the Science and Social Science Citation Indexes (SCI and SSCI) with similar data based on Scopus 2012. First, global maps were developed for the two sets separately; sets of documents can then be compared using overlays to both maps. Using fuzzy-string matching and ISSN numbers, we were able to match 10,524 journal names between the two sets; that is, 96.4% of the 10,936 journals contained in JCR or 51.2% of the 20,554 journals covered by Scopus. Network analysis was then pursued on the set of journals shared between the two databases and the two sets of unique journals. Citations among the shared journals are more comprehensively covered in JCR than Scopus, so the network in JCR is denser and more connected than in Scopus. The ranking of shared journals in terms of indegree (that is, numbers of citing journals) or total citations is similar in both databases overall (Spearman's \r{ho} 〉 0.97), but some individual journals rank very differently. Journals that are unique to Scopus seem to be less important--they are citing shared journals rather than being cited by them--but the humanities are covered better in Scopus than in JCR.","Leydesdorff, Loet;de Moya-Anegón, Félix;de Nooy, Wouter",ArXiv e-prints,X02bea1aad;X07606b576;X07bbe0aa2;X0b2c19ace;X0cf195a88;X0d74db05f;X0f17f1e6d;X1add56c6f;X24757d814;X24d400e1f;X2bb9f0ed9;X329980eb2;X33218a7e7;X37b80f7f5;X3b8725af3;X416e5d541;X460bbf60b;X4c9c6d2b4;X4d7578d24;X4f5a262a8;X51f188c4c;X533f3a0e5;X58f339ffd;X61ebdfb8b;X6254a94d2;X670d673b0;X677182a05;X67e04ddb5;X6ceddd452;X6d1be79d0;X7742122c3;X7762bb877;X7846e7752;X7e01e2ff5;X804325f85;X8046fa85a;X868367fb1;X868e11c94;X88746727f;X89f3794ac;X8ca7833fb;X8f43064ff;X90c5fe842;X9156758d1;X93979d67d;X96f2e38b3;X995e13295;Xa0565ae19;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa2613e5fb;Xa37748b0d;Xa7de30ffa;Xa9157de34;Xa9e2a6c53;Xab9df8809;Xabef6c922;Xad63d9e43;Xb06aa336d;Xb1bcfe4e3;Xb1e5889f8;Xb2fb15aec;Xb3510f4e7;Xb43c0e39a;Xb65036c66;Xb85ad3102;Xc7e0a59d4;Xcc35d27a1;Xd15f7061c;Xd7432a5ba;Xd7b45e936;Xd9081b1d6;Xda0a94046;Xdac514fc5;Xdb7f859ea;Xdc5dbf2aa;Xdcd36884b;Xdd2ed0b1d;Xdd31eec98;Xe23353709;Xe699b3802;Xec486e3c2;Xed0e43df5;Xf0b256a4f;Xfa15a9646;Xfb984bcdc;Xfcf2029f9,87,"Aggregated journal-journal citation relations in Scopus and Web-of-Science matched and compared in terms of networks, maps, and interactive overlays",http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2505,2014
1204,"Nearly a decade ago, the science community was introduced to the $h$-index, a proposed statistical measure of the collective impact of the publications of any individual researcher. It is of course undeniable that any method of reducing a complex data set to a single number will necessarily have certain limitations and introduce certain biases. However, in this paper we point out that the definition of the $h$-index actually suffers from something far deeper: a hidden mathematical incompleteness intrinsic to its definition. In particular, we point out that one critical step within the definition of $h$ has been missed until now, resulting in an index which only achieves its stated objectives under certain rather limited circumstances. For example, this incompleteness explains why the $h$-index ultimately has more utility in certain scientific subfields than others. In this paper, we expose the origin of this incompleteness and then also propose a method of completing the definition of $h$ in a way which remains close to its original guiding principle. As a result, this ""completed"" $h$ not only reduces to the usual $h$ in cases where the $h$-index already achieves its objectives, but also extends the validity of the $h$-index into situations where it currently does not.","Dienes, Keith R.",ArXiv e-prints,X03ec30a69;X05a2257af;X060b02504;X07198ba0e;X081340eb9;X095bdad85;X0abec38fd;X0c5c20443;X0f66ac738;X1637bc2bc;X24d7ddec9;X32e23c073;X33218a7e7;X36fd51807;X3ada09924;X3dd2f4020;X45db56faa;X4a92765e6;X4c39dcb42;X5b8b512cf;X640663007;X657e9fec4;X67b1432b7;X6c5f21ac4;X703b5982e;X731485132;X82690b573;X84a92dce2;X84f210d27;X8c893c845;X8f4e93e86;X933c74132;X95fe3b44d;X9719e8bce;Xac8bb5a53;Xacad2adb2;Xbe9cbc350;Xbf0ac3743;Xc069f6bff;Xc35a9ecb8;Xccd88aa61;Xcfbbe7c0b;Xd1a730cb9;Xdbb547059;Xe20a4eac8;Xe6047044e;Xec8e900fe;Xed686d660;Xf1e2b76e4,49,Completing $h$,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2603,2014
1205,"For more than forty years now, modern theories of literature (Compagnon, 1979) insist on the role of paraphrases, rewritings, citations, reciprocal borrowings and mutual contributions of any kinds. The notions of intertextuality, transtextuality, hypertextuality/hypotextuality, were introduced in the seventies and eighties to approach these phenomena. The careful analysis of these references is of particular interest in evaluating the distance that the creator voluntarily introduces with his/her masters. Phoebus is collaborative project that makes computer scientists from the University Pierre and Marie Curie (LIP6-UPMC) collaborate with the literary teams of Paris-Sorbonne University with the aim to develop efficient tools for literary studies that take advantage of modern computer science techniques. In this context, we have developed a piece of software that automatically detects and explores networks of textual reuses in classical literature.

1206,We test 16 bibliometric indicators with respect to their validity at the level of the individual researcher by estimating their power to predict later successful researchers. We compare the indicators of a sample of astrophysics researchers who later co-authored highly cited papers before their first landmark paper with the distributions of these indicators over a random control group of young authors in astronomy and astrophysics. We find that field and citation-window normalisation substantially improves the predicting power of citation indicators. The two indicators of total influence based on citation numbers normalised with expected citation numbers are the only indicators which show differences between later stars and random authors significant on a 1% level. Indicators of paper output are not very useful to predict later stars.

1207,"In our chapter we address the statistical analysis of percentiles: How should the citation impact of institutions be compared? In educational and psychological testing, percentiles are already used widely as a standard to evaluate an individual's test scores - intelligence tests for example - by comparing them with the percentiles of a calibrated sample. Percentiles, or percentile rank classes, are also a very suitable method for bibliometrics to normalize citations of publications in terms of the subject category and the publication year and, unlike the mean-based indicators (the relative citation rates), percentiles are scarcely affected by skewed distributions of citations. The percentile of a certain publication provides information about the citation impact this publication has achieved in comparison to other similar publications in the same subject category and publication year. Analyses of percentiles, however, have not always been presented in the most effective and meaningful way. New APA guidelines (American Psychological Association, 2010) suggest a lesser emphasis on significance tests and a greater emphasis on the substantive and practical significance of findings. Drawing on work by Cumming (2012) we show how examinations of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d statistic) and confidence intervals can lead to a clear understanding of citation impact differences.","Williams, Richard;Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X02bea1aad;X04714dfbc;X0743d1f20;X171a3f472;X20dcefbfd;X2498d79ea;X33218a7e7;X7a6f29d65;X85ed273f7;X9323ee095;X9936dfce2;X9e36d65fa;Xa1b994b71;Xa53ef203c;Xb252447eb;Xbad19845e;Xc0c902ef6;Xc1acff414;Xd569921d5;Xd8839aa37;Xe7df873bc;Xe8ce46fd5;Xfd076970f,23,The substantive and practical significance of citation impact differences between institutions: Guidelines for the analysis of percentiles using effect sizes and confidence intervals,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3720,2014
1208,"The BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China, and South Africa) are noted for their increasing participation in science and technology. The governments of these countries have been boosting their investments in research and development to become part of the group of nations doing research at a world-class level. This study investigates the development of the BRICS countries in the domain of top-cited papers (top 10% and 1% most frequently cited papers) between 1990 and 2010. To assess the extent to which these countries have become important players on the top level, we compare the BRICS countries with the top-performing countries worldwide. As the analyses of the (annual) growth rates show, with the exception of Russia, the BRICS countries have increased their output in terms of most frequently-cited papers at a higher rate than the top-cited countries worldwide. In a further step of analysis for this study, we generate co-authorship networks among authors of highly cited papers for four time points to view changes in BRICS participation (1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010). Here, the results show that all BRICS countries succeeded in becoming part of this network, whereby the Chinese collaboration activities focus on the USA.","Bornmann, Lutz;Wagner, Caroline;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X0740421ed;X07bbe0aa2;X10b69672b;X111b919c2;X14faff184;X16753c1b5;X183ec5310;X1babd383d;X1c230ce67;X1da9b0dae;X1e31c8bce;X20aa1bb9e;X2245fe1b9;X25cd7b360;X286652cc8;X28d2a2065;X2b18784e6;X2b721fcce;X2c671cc61;X31cafe2d1;X33218a7e7;X334e86e42;X348814447;X36c1613f7;X39006f58f;X3e3f1fa14;X3ea83572f;X426a975ed;X429c57394;X43da37eab;X4eb9244ea;X59edd725c;X5b72e6296;X6219ca39b;X6a43198d2;X75775d30e;X7c0255722;X8be3f966a;X8f5f20682;X8ff4ff528;X96f2e38b3;X9abf9ad52;X9d44bf3da;X9dfeaef6c;Xa08e703f2;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa1efd0510;Xa8d671a08;Xa9157de34;Xb06aa336d;Xb0c0f7098;Xb3510f4e7;Xb6176d6e7;Xb76ecd4c6;Xbc23943c8;Xbe4e39122;Xc13331a39;Xc23c66c02;Xc8d143d69;Xcc3e03249;Xcc49bca41;Xce0cb565f;Xced70e1c5;Xd8e1637c8;Xdec7c7873;Xe9ba93586;Xeecd14c46;Xef1c281fa;Xf2338569a;Xf2ff1585b;Xf5a83abcf;Xf5e7c9ca5;Xf644d3c07;Xf9a2486f3;Xfdea7d14b;Xff1610fdf,77,BRICS countries and scientific excellence: A bibliometric analysis of most frequently-cited papers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3721,2014

B 84, 535 (2011), 10.1140/epjb/e2011-10746-5] we revisit the question whether the usage of large citation datasets allows for the quantitative assessment of social (by means of coauthorship of publications) influence on the progression of science. Applying a more comprehensive and well-curated dataset containing the publications in the journals of the American Physical Society during the whole 20th century we find that the measure chosen in the original study, a score based on small induced subgraphs, has to be used with caution, since the obtained results are highly sensitive to the exact implementation of the author disambiguation task.","Klosik, David F.;Bornholdt, Stefan;Hütt, Marc-Thorsten",Physical Review E,X209c00892;X30cd2689b;X50b17cbec;X51ad51d79;X53b57db59;X553466a94;X62dc417a9;X6491f229e;X64c16ecb4;X66497185b;X719f80a71;X71a4a1616;X73c955fbc;X7a3c25bde;Xa2034f584;Xa8c7e9522;Xbc915ef9d;Xccd88aa61;Xdad6086b8;Xe039073a5;Xe0437f3ff;Xf921a2cfe;Xffa1e2d37,23,Motif-based success scores in coauthorship networks are highly sensitive to author name disambiguation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7827,2014
1210,"Given the growing use of impact metrics in the evaluation of scholars, journals, academic institutions, and even countries, there is a critical need for means to compare scientific impact across disciplinary boundaries. Unfortunately, citation-based metrics are strongly biased by diverse field sizes and publication and citation practices. As a result, we have witnessed an explosion in the number of newly proposed metrics that claim to be ""universal."" However, there is currently no way to objectively assess whether a normalized metric can actually compensate for disciplinary bias. We introduce a new method to assess the universality of any scholarly impact metric, and apply it to evaluate a number of established metrics. We also define a very simple new metric hs, which proves to be universal, thus allowing to compare the impact of scholars across scientific disciplines. These results move us closer to a formal methodology in the measure of scholarly impact.","Kaur, Jasleen;Radicchi, Filippo;Menczer, Filippo",ArXiv e-prints,X0280d30ca;X035917cf9;X0daabcf26;X1908b3f64;X280293e36;X2b4a23c97;X2bfcc04f3;X2c176d65f;X3067844b5;X30cd2689b;X36a756299;X3b99c44ee;X4246007e2;X466bffc04;X490d57efe;X495f609e4;X4bd0c3df1;X4da608b4a;X50e67fb4b;X574549796;X57d312e10;X6cddf0fd6;X6fbcc38cb;X71f9aebc0;X795fc1dab;X7e892c523;X81f533be1;X826b4c487;X86212befc;X86c487c6e;X874ac1f8d;X87d7bc832;X8b7a9b464;X938ace7c3;X983deeb0e;X9ae6b74e6;X9be4b74fd;X9c89ed7ad;X9cd3b890f;Xa1c30eacb;Xa23307c28;Xa861c37c1;Xa97ad586e;Xae2434a55;Xb18633264;Xc10d60e69;Xc2fff1b33;Xc35d98b52;Xc75375a25;Xca537f5e5;Xcbc5e1a87;Xcda6c6714;Xd1abe56a7;Xd25b63c03;Xd54963fcf;Xd57f404cf;Xd7b358714;Xd7d3213d0;Xd804939ad;Xd9cbfde83;Xd9e2d5d5c;Xdb861f293;Xddce5b1aa;Xde40cfd1b;Xdea020f9a;Xe1d833731;Xee9216716;Xf8648d57e;Xf86ac68ec,69,Universality of scholarly impact metrics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6339,2013
1211,"Memes are the cultural equivalent of genes that spread across human culture by means of imitation. What makes a meme and what distinguishes it from other forms of information, however, is still poorly understood. Our analysis of memes in the scientific literature reveals that they are governed by a surprisingly simple relationship between frequency of occurrence and the degree to which they propagate along the citation graph. We propose a simple formalization of this pattern and validate it with data from close to 50 million publication records from the Web of Science, PubMed Central, and the American Physical Society. Evaluations relying on human annotators, citation network randomizations, and comparisons with several alternative approaches confirm that our formula is accurate and effective, without a dependence on linguistic or ontological knowledge and without the application of arbitrary thresholds or filters.","Kuhn, Tobias;Perc, Matjaž;Helbing, Dirk",Physical Review X,509ac2f300;54b9248348;X08ff6a71b;X0ddf4f540;X0e82af4ee;X149c66434;X1addebccd;X2177c3743;X28d46db80;X33218a7e7;X385cac60a;X38b388c5b;X47b720605;X4a4305e80;X4b252c59e;X4d7639b04;X50e79f172;X5a2fc8f2a;X5c2c2eb37;X64673003c;X67a862182;X68562d61a;X6d8ef47d4;X76b2af8da;X7d3f03970;X84a3145fa;X8f8353260;X97e8bb688;Xa21790943;Xaa61495de;Xabce3d0ee;Xafcec47ca;Xb65455eba;Xb7d0edf46;Xbc7e34594;Xc02687cbf;Xc78a01e12;Xc9355163b;Xccf10d7ae;Xce691d640;Xcf8a03be8;Xd4432ba17;Xd47aa7829;Xdad6086b8;Xdc9e9c3b0;Xdd634d3f9;Xe74d8f03b;Xeecdc852b;Xeeef9dc1c;Xf1a01bcda;Xf9f192bc7;Xfc390be6e,52,Inheritance Patterns in Citation Networks Reveal Scientific Memes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3757,2014

We defined sets of papers dealing with three topics located on different levels of aggregation: h-index, webometrics, and bibliometrics.

1219,"China's remarkable gains in science over the past 25 years have been well documented (e.g., Jin and Rousseau, 2005a; Zhou and Leydesdorff, 2006; Shelton & Foland, 2009) but it is less well known that China and the United States have become each other's top collaborating country. Science and technology has been a primary vehicle for growing the bilateral relationship between China and the United States since the opening of relations between the two countries in the late 1970s. During the 2000s, the scientific relationship between China and the United States--as measured in coauthored papers--showed significant growth. Chinese scientists claim first authorship much more frequently than U.S. counterparts by the end of the decade. The sustained rate of increase of collaboration with one other country is unprecedented on the U.S. side. Even growth in relations with eastern European nations does not match the growth in the relationship between China and the United States. Both countries can benefit from the relationship, but for the U.S., greater benefit would come from a more targeted strategy.","Wagner, Caroline;Leydesdorff, Loet;Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X050ea014e;X08595a2a3;X08614c717;X086d95d8d;X17ed92288;X1d7ed5973;X2431110d2;X26622b8fb;X2b70e1bf4;X33218a7e7;X3f6e530d7;X40f5e39ed;X4248f47dd;X46bbc5de8;X46d1ba054;X482bb12b7;X4862c163e;X4dbb4ff27;X5327a4472;X5be02f688;X5c128a5bc;X5c16299ae;X6879f4c32;X6d88be3e1;X72db474e5;X73f4a0f7e;X75fecc85d;X76ac5cc2f;X77c9d08f6;X786af8782;X78b6b2247;X78c4096f4;X812fc2cd3;X82690b573;X85e07d244;X8b84ccf69;X94b3331f8;X96cfc801a;X96f2e38b3;X99cbd7592;X9c6db04f4;X9f2b72713;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa3cf125ba;Xa5ab69078;Xa7fec5000;Xabd75c44a;Xb0c1886f2;Xb483e3648;Xb57583609;Xbb984a35f;Xbe4e39122;Xc9117f3e6;Xcb48dd98d;Xcce62715c;Xe564e166a;Xe6353caa4;Xecd59c4f6;Xed390839a;Xf9bef675d;Xfb2ce26a0,61,Recent Developments in China-U.S. Cooperation in Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6545,2014
1220,"Marked by the highlights of native generation of EPUB E-books and TikZ support for creating SVG images, we present an annual report of LaTeXML development in 2013. LaTeXML provides a reimplementation of the $\TeX$ parser, geared towards preserving macro semantics; it supports an array of output formats, notably HTML5, EPUB, XHTML and its own $\LaTeX$-near XML. Other highlights include enhancing performance when used inside high-throughput build-systems, via incorporating a native ZIP archive workflow, as well as a simplified installation procedure that now allows to deploy LaTeXML as a cloud service. To this end, we also introduce an official plugin-based scheme for publishing new features that go beyond the core scope of LaTeXML, such as web services or unconventional post-processors. The software suite has now migrated to GitHub and we welcome forks and patches from the wider FLOSS community.","Ginev, Deyan;Miller, Bruce R.;Oprea, Silviu",ArXiv e-prints,5535a83a5d;X000daf869;X0f120a13b;X10338ec2a;X1baec5e54;X1d510bf74;X21f568678;X2887f9343;X2f011279d;X33218a7e7;X3f44aab68;X466f64eb3;X4ecf98f3d;X597c4ce53;X6bb0a1d70;X6bd003f02;X6fc6944d8;X7774ddb85;X79b2281a8;X7de8e84b5;X7ed854592;X862167fdd;X87867cebd;X899ab0d80;X8d5a70982;X915f9331f;X91d9bad61;X9919ab499;X9d27e40b4;Xa22c47022;Xa873e16b6;Xb65fbb98b;Xb7f2b0898;Xbb2749050;Xbcfd7301f;Xc594302d6;Xc798c3f96;Xc93f53259;Xcb34657cf;Xd18983d5b;Xd4cd49bf5;Xda0b1fc97;Xdba407495;Xe2c49e722;Xe8b554c70;Xe9029352c;Xea60cb8f8;Xebebcf544;Xec6cabe15;Xf8a69d905,50,E-books and Graphics with LaTeXML,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6547,2014

The main focus of this paper is to investigate the commonalities between these two problems and the uses of these commonalities for the creation of new clustering algorithms for categorical data based on cross-fertilization between the two disjoint research fields. More precisely, we formally transform the CDC problem into an LC problem, and apply LC approach for clustering categorical data. Experimental results on real datasets show that LC based clustering method is competitive with existing CDC algorithms with respect to clustering accuracy.","He, Zengyou;Xu, Xiaofei;Deng, Shengchun",ArXiv e-prints,X04714dfbc;X0c7e71ec7;X122377de9;X14477cd23;X165e8948a;X178575913;X1b947ca5f;X312c05e20;X43aebf103;X44464de53;X46e10759f;X55fb127ca;X56c584254;X58d923174;X5b5e1389a;X617a0d5f7;X6312ceab4;X64b08baff;X7403b4f4c;X751f1bfb4;X790ba5305;X7c4b92930;X80b687ffd;X82d9151a3;X83e055dae;X87b37e8bc;X884e70fc5;X8c90f1a60;X8cb12abe7;Xa5f4862ac;Xa76273038;Xa8f3f5279;Xabd4a73de;Xac5c47cba;Xb1c53cd5a;Xbab228768;Xcf4597417;Xd1605f0d2;Xd23c1649a;Xd61e5345d;Xdb79cce97;Xdb8f5c7d1;Xe3215a512;Xe7b94784a;Xeefd181e5;Xef8bd66f2;Xfec0f49ea;Xff2975b29,48,A Link Clustering Based Approach for Clustering Categorical Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0412019,2004

1225,"This paper examines the proximity of authors to those they cite using degrees of separation in a co-author network, essentially using collaboration networks to expand on the notion of self-citations. While the proportion of direct self-citations (including co-authors of both citing and cited papers) is relatively constant in time and across specialties in the natural sciences (10% of citations) and the social sciences (20%), the same cannot be said for citations to authors who are members of the co-author network. Differences between fields and trends over time lie not only in the degree of co-authorship which defines the large-scale topology of the collaboration network, but also in the referencing practices within a given discipline, computed by defining a propensity to cite at a given distance within the collaboration network. Overall, there is little tendency to cite those nearby in the collaboration network, excluding direct self-citations. By analyzing these social references, we characterize the social capital of local collaboration networks in terms of the knowledge production within scientific fields. These results have implications for the long-standing debate over biases common to most types of citation analysis, and for understanding citation practices across scientific disciplines over the past 50 years. In addition, our findings have important practical implications for the availability of 'arm's length' expert reviewers of grant applications and manuscripts.","Wallace, Matthew L.;Larivière, Vincent;Gingras, Yves",PLoS ONE,550f025639;X01b9b6e2b;X0753e5f09;X3ebb18fd8;X4cbbb69ab;X6cdfb3668;X88af60817;X95663fd7e;X95984c141;Xa1b994b71;Xb1cc0a94c;Xb9e1a6f32;Xd19e9ac89,13,A Small World of Citations?

1226,"The goal of this working paper is to summarize the main empirical evidences provided by the scientific community as regards the comparison between the two main citation based academic search engines: Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search, paying special attention to the following issues: coverage, correlations between journal rankings, and usage of these academic search engines. Additionally, selfelaborated data is offered, which are intended to provide current evidence about the popularity of these tools on the Web, by measuring the number of rich files PDF, PPT and DOC in which these tools are mentioned, the amount of external links that both products receive, and the search queries frequency from Google Trends. The poor results obtained by MAS led us to an unexpected and unnoticed discovery: Microsoft Academic Search is outdated since 2013. Therefore, the second part of the working paper aims at advancing some data demonstrating this lack of update. For this purpose we gathered the number of total records indexed by Microsoft Academic Search since 2000. The data shows an abrupt drop in the number of documents indexed from 2,346,228 in 2010 to 8,147 in 2013 and 802 in 2014. This decrease is offered according to 15 thematic areas as well.

Bibliometric techniques are not yet widely used to enhance retrieval processes in digital libraries, although they offer value-added effects for users. In this workshop we will explore how statistical modelling of scholarship, such as Bradfordizing or network analysis of co-authorship network, can improve retrieval services for specific communities, as well as for large, cross-domain collections. This workshop aims to raise awareness of the missing link between information retrieval (IR) and bibliometrics / scientometrics and to create a common ground for the incorporation of bibliometric-enhanced services into retrieval at the digital library interface. Our interests include information retrieval, information seeking, science modelling, network analysis, and digital libraries.

1231,"h-index has become the most popular indicator for quantifying a scientist's scientific impact in various scientific fields. h-index is defined as the largest number of papers with citation number larger than or equal to h and it treats each citation equally. However, different citations usually come from different papers with different influence and quality, and a citation from a highly influential paper is a greater recognition of the target paper than a citation from an ordinary paper. Based on this assumption, we proposed a new indicator named x-index to quantify a scientist's scientific impact by considering only the citations coming from influential papers. x-index is defined as the largest number of papers with influential citation number larger than or equal to x, where each influential citation comes from a paper for which the average ACNPP (Average Citation Number Per Paper) of its authors larger than or equal to x . Through analysis on the APS dataset, we find that the proposed x-index has much better ability to discriminate between Physics Prize Winners and ordinary physicists.","Wan, Xiaojun",ArXiv e-prints,X02bea1aad;X05a8a5d10;X05e3693c8;X09a018eb4;X0b30fbadc;X0bda578db;X114840220;X1d9688fc1;X23b88ea94;X2cd17adc0;X2cf0d2aac;X31f8fedc6;X3a01366b1;X3b4d519ee;X4a9ca096b;X4b6e0384f;X66f3ce0b2;X6f3ca1aa4;X703715e9b;X724ca3911;X75aeefc66;X82d1a498b;X82d26ae85;X8dd595d9f;X900d8e496;X908b7704a;X90dd07739;X98fb82851;Xbab961688;Xbb62315c5;Xbbbf625ae;Xc07d51da9;Xc3fc5cd0b;Xc4738bbd6;Xc7f70dd74;Xd3f86c2bb;Xd72d2fcc8;Xdf52165da;Xe74d8f03b;Xe76cc291d;Xe77cd2f57;Xe8b609c88;Xed1f8c93a;Xf46343259;Xf4799c5a3;Xf4ffd5bbc;Xf886532e8;Xfe02ef20c,48,x-index: a fantastic new indicator for quantifying a scientist's scientific impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0641,2014

At all levels, the scientific collaborations network structures were central considering the closeness centralization while betweenness and degree centralization were much lower. In general networks density, connectedness, centralization and clustering coefficient were highest in marco-level and decreasing as the network size grow to the lowest in micro-level.

It reviews previous attempts to use web archives to understand national web domains and describes the dataset. Next, it presents an analysis of the .uk domain, including the overall number of links in the archive and changes in the link density of different second-level domains over time. We then explore changes over time within a particular second-level domain, the academic subdomain .ac.uk, and compare linking practices with variables, including institutional affiliation, league table ranking, and geographic location. We do not detect institutional affiliation affecting linking practices and find only partial evidence of league table ranking affecting network centrality, but find a clear inverse relationship between the density of links and the geographical distance between universities. This echoes prior findings regarding offline academic activity, which allows us to argue that real-world factors like geography continue to shape academic relationships even in the Internet age.

1244,"Massive amounts of contributed content -- including traditional literature, blogs, music, videos, reviews and tweets -- are available on the Internet today, with authors numbering in many millions. Textual information, such as product or service reviews, is an important and increasingly popular type of content that is being used as a foundation of many trendy community-based reviewing sites, such as TripAdvisor and Yelp. Some recent results have shown that, due partly to their specialized/topical nature, sets of reviews authored by the same person are readily linkable based on simple stylometric features. In practice, this means that individuals who author more than a few reviews under different accounts (whether within one site or across multiple sites) can be linked, which represents a significant loss of privacy. In this paper, we start by showing that the problem is actually worse than previously believed. We then explore ways to mitigate authorship linkability in community-based reviewing. We first attempt to harness the global power of crowdsourcing by engaging random strangers into the process of re-writing reviews. As our empirical results (obtained from Amazon Mechanical Turk) clearly demonstrate, crowdsourcing yields impressively sensible reviews that reflect sufficiently different stylometric characteristics such that prior stylometric linkability techniques become largely ineffective. We also consider using machine translation to automatically re-write reviews. Contrary to what was previously believed, our results show that translation decreases authorship linkability as the number of intermediate languages grows. Finally, we explore the combination of crowdsourcing and machine translation and report on the results.","Almishari, Mishari;Oguz, Ekin;Tsudik, Gene",ArXiv e-prints,X6cacdca17;X6d83fa608;X848148b42;X97494db9f;X9aed8ebbf;Xc9eddf390;Xcb8b4991f;Xf61b9f254;Xfe2a3e40f,9,Fighting Authorship Linkability with Crowdsourcing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4918,2014
1245,"The scientific enterprise depends critically on the preservation of and open access to published data. This basic tenet applies acutely to phylogenies (estimates of evolutionary relationships among species). Increasingly, phylogenies are estimated from increasingly large, genome-scale datasets using increasingly complex statistical methods that require increasing levels of expertise and computational investment. Moreover, the resulting phylogenetic data provide an explicit historical perspective that critically informs research in a vast and growing number of scientific disciplines. One such use is the study of changes in rates of lineage diversification (speciation - extinction) through time. As part of a meta-analysis in this area, we sought to collect phylogenetic data (comprising nucleotide sequence alignment and tree files) from 217 studies published in 46 journals over a 13-year period. We document our attempts to procure those data (from online archives and by direct request to corresponding authors), and report results of analyses (using Bayesian logistic regression) to assess the impact of various factors on the success of our efforts. Overall, complete phylogenetic data for ~60% of these studies are effectively lost to science. Our study indicates that phylogenetic data are more likely to be deposited in online archives and/or shared upon request when: (1) the publishing journal has a strong data-sharing policy; (2) the publishing journal has a higher impact factor, and; (3) the data are requested from faculty rather than students. Although the situation appears dire, our analyses suggest that it is far from hopeless: recent initiatives by the scientific community -- including policy changes by journals and funding agencies -- are improving the state of affairs.","Magee, Andrew F.;May, Michael R.;Moore, Brian R.",ArXiv e-prints,X0ad7e243d;X0d0b206c4;X5b8fc4438;X7d3f03970;Xa654ebc3f;Xbf1b3e89f,6,The Dawn of Open Access to Phylogenetic Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6623,2014

1247,"Many innovations are inspired by past ideas in a nontrivial way. Tracing these origins and identifying scientific branches is crucial for research inspirations. In this paper, we use citation relations to identify the descendant chart, i.e., the family tree of research papers. Unlike other spanning trees that focus on cost or distance minimization, we make use of the nature of citations and identify the most important parent for each publication, leading to a treelike backbone of the citation network. Measures are introduced to validate the backbone as the descendant chart. We show that citation backbones can well characterize the hierarchical and fractal structure of scientific development, and lead to an accurate classification of fields and subfields.","Gualdi, S.;Yeung, C.

1248,"This article presents the top-level of an ontology categorizing and generalizing best practices and quality criteria or measures for Linked Data. It permits to compare these techniques and have a synthetic organized view of what can or should be done for knowledge sharing purposes. This ontology is part of a general knowledge base that can be accessed and complemented by any Web user. Thus, it can be seen as a cooperatively built library for the above cited elements. Since they permit to evaluate information objects and create better ones, these elements also permit knowledge-based tools and techniques - as well as knowledge providers - to be evaluated and categorized based on their input/output information objects. One top-level distinction permitting to organize this ontology is the one between content, medium and containers of descriptions. Various structural, ontological, syntactical and lexical distinctions are then used.","Martin, Philippe A.",ArXiv e-prints,X34e880c0b;X378a992f1;X5a8d2d029;X935b7c6b6;X9e6786660;Xa2613e5fb;Xad63d9e43;Xad6ee8519;Xb20972579;Xf52246dee;Xf56e36f87;Xf7d663ab7;Xf9e718125,13,Organizing Linked Data Quality Related Methods,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7200,2013

1251,"As the number of scientific journals has multiplied, journal rankings have become increasingly important for scientific decisions. From submissions and subscriptions to grants and hirings, researchers, policy makers, and funding agencies make important decisions with influence from journal rankings such as the ISI journal impact factor. Typically, the rankings are derived from the citation network between a selection of journals and unavoidably depend on this selection. However, little is known about how robust rankings are to the selection of included journals. Here we compare the robustness of three journal rankings based on network flows induced on citation networks. They model pathways of researchers navigating scholarly literature, stepping between journals and remembering their previous steps to different degree: zero-step memory as impact factor, one-step memory as Eigenfactor, and two-step memory, corresponding to zero-, first-, and second-order Markov models of citation flow between journals. We conclude that higher-order Markov models perform better and are more robust to the selection of journals. Whereas our analysis indicates that higher-order models perform better, the performance gain for the second-order Markov model comes at the cost of requiring more citation data over a longer time period.","Bohlin, Ludvig;Viamontes Esquivel, Alcides;Lancichinetti, Andrea;Rosvall, Martin",ArXiv e-prints,X08595a2a3;X0c7471920;X0dc2b3e07;X15b817b30;X172add237;X1e48150f8;X21cd19d88;X248478b73;X256129a13;X2b937396e;X4733fcceb;X498db336f;X567e537d6;X5b381b24a;X66736d567;X67917f309;X71e980174;X73f8aa9f6;X74013eb80;X7813dd121;X7f4011c2c;X82690b573;X85bcd142e;X89bb39141;X8da31b1ba;X8eb0b0c33;X8f2faa5be;X914c6ad1e;X91a4b8e07;X92e763781;X933c74132;X9a00dbbcd;X9b4ec06b4;X9d1be04b9;X9ddad4926;X9fafb6ed6;Xa16bc76a1;Xa654ebc3f;Xb0cfeefb0;Xb7b920db6;Xbb46806f7;Xbc8061c22;Xc5a7b6608;Xccd88aa61;Xceb69c0f0;Xd361a1062;Xd40bd03d5;Xe2b1f71c1;Xe3e7deb4e;Xe3ffebeec;Xe4d042885;Xee6918665,52,Robustness of journal rankings by network flows with different amounts of memory,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7832,2014

1253,"Education digital libraries contain cataloged resources as well as contextual information about innovations in the use of educational technology, exemplar stories about community activities, and news from various user communities that include teachers, students, scholars, and developers. Long-standing library traditions of service, preservation, democratization of knowledge, rich discourse, equal access, and fair use are evident in library communications models that both pull in and push out contextual information from multiple sources integrated with editorial production processes. This paper argues that a dynamic narrative flow [1] is enabled by effective management of complex content and communications in a decentralized web-based education digital library making publishing objects such as aggregations of resources, or selected parts of objects [4] accessible through a Content and Communications System. Providing services that encourage patrons to reuse, reflect out, and contribute resources back [5] to the Library increases the reach and impact of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL).

1254,"Numerous digital humanities projects maintain their data collections in the form of text, images, and metadata. While data may be stored in many formats, from plain text to XML to relational databases, the use of the resource description framework (RDF) as a standardized representation has gained considerable traction during the last five years. Almost every digital humanities meeting has at least one session concerned with the topic of digital humanities, RDF, and linked data. While most existing work in linked data has focused on improving algorithms for entity matching, the aim of the LinkedHumanities project is to build digital humanities tools that work ""out of the box,"" enabling their use by humanities scholars, computer scientists, librarians, and information scientists alike. With this paper, we report on the Linked Open Data Enhancer (LODE) framework developed as part of the LinkedHumanities project. With LODE we support non-technical users to enrich a local RDF repository with high-quality data from the Linked Open Data cloud. LODE links and enhances the local RDF repository without compromising the quality of the data. In particular, LODE supports the user in the enhancement and linking process by providing intuitive user-interfaces and by suggesting high-quality linking candidates using tailored matching algorithms. We hope that the LODE framework will be useful to digital humanities scholars complementing other digital humanities tools.","Huber, Jakob;Sztyler, Timo;Noessner, Jan;Murdock, Jaimie;Allen, Colin;Niepert, Mathias",ArXiv e-prints,X0127d0a99;X05d889131;X0adcd22a3;X0af0560ea;X0de0478b2;X15ac6afa9;X17f964743;X1b580ba2b;X2222dbf6e;X258d7cfff;X2745bb5c5;X27460dfd7;X29e2c309d;X2a2ee9ecf;X2e4c5cc68;X315c8fff3;X33611a68e;X3c5a88bea;X4008ec009;X42aac2545;X479111891;X4c40d1fa3;X503667537;X5472b54dd;X57278d530;X582a63236;X6bdbbc681;X7c1cd6bc5;X83647d150;X8a4dcc290;X944e414e2;X97da6a7fd;X9cd27b529;X9f1e28a9e;X9f92ac4c8;Xa0d100ce3;Xa61706a70;Xa654ebc3f;Xaa36c8db1;Xac2a2edb3;Xaf1ce0eda;Xaf8ee47c0;Xb46d77426;Xba516daa1;Xc5c0d14e1;Xca0b762e6;Xce3a785d8;Xe3276e208;Xe36ea8812;Xea3e33cea;Xf85655e8a;Xf8f712901;Xff91129a8,53,LODE: Linking Digital Humanities Content to the Web of Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0216,2014

In the evolving model, we consider the mechanism combined with preferential attachment and the aging influence. Simulation results show that the proposed model can characterize the citation distribution of the real system very well. In addition, we give the analytical result of the citation distribution using the master equation. Detailed analysis showed that the time decay factor should be the origin of the same citation distribution between the proposed model and the empirical result. The proposed model might shed some lights in understanding the underlying laws governing the structure of real citation networks.","Hu, Feng;Zhao, Hai-Xing;Zhan, Xiu-Xiu;Liu, Chuang;Zhang, Zi-Ke",ArXiv e-prints,X14a96c259;X174fd5071;X1778b723d;X1babd383d;X1ca5a6eac;X25bd6525e;X27b09a548;X3d1b724f1;X40da9faa9;X4af309cf2;X60cd1d085;X68ee2feb0;X69676ff45;X6a12b0e36;X6e996bbc9;X748cc1ecd;X81f37eab1;X835ddc9c9;X9ba88add2;X9d934b999;X9ee8cc9ef;Xa04aa6e7b;Xa0c7f3eee;Xa1b994b71;Xb8700ca97;Xbe4e39122;Xc41521ce0;Xd16f09895;Xe04420919;Xeee238ff8;Xef8a7316c,31,Evolution of citation networks with the hypergraph formalism,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0936,2014
1256,"Information systems usually show as a particular point of failure the vagueness between user search terms and the knowledge orders of the information space in question. Some kind of guided searching therefore becomes more and more important in order to precisely discover information without knowing the right search terms. Knowledge maps of digital library collections are promising navigation tools through knowledge spaces but still far away from being applicable for searching digital libraries. However, there is no continuous knowledge exchange between the ""map makers"" on the one hand and the Information Retrieval (IR) specialists on the other hand. Thus, there is also a lack of models that properly combine insights of the two strands. The proposed workshop aims at bringing together these two communities: experts in IR reflecting on visual enhanced search interfaces and experts in knowledge mapping reflecting on visualizations of the content of a collection that might also present a context for a search term in a visual manner. The intention of the workshop is to raise awareness of the potential of interactive knowledge maps for information seeking purposes and to create a common ground for experiments aiming at the incorporation of knowledge maps into IR models at the level of the user interface.","Mutschke, Peter;Scharnhorst, Andrea;Guéret, Christophe;Mayr, Philipp;Hansen, Preben;Slavic, Aida",ArXiv e-prints,54ffc9df7a;X0c38e1a22;X0f16c041b;X1a9b856f6;X1e7c9098f;X1fe5d4baf;X2135881f9;X2a8843cbe;X32eacad1f;X3627788d6;X49aa950a1;X60e410849;X7aff1d8bc;X8429de704;X858e34f81;X958fa3dc2;X991477ff1;X9c46fdb05;X9cf6861d6;X9db9cea94;Xa1b994b71;Xa2a7603ef;Xae1e6894c;Xbcf345eea;Xbe4e39122;Xbfdecf065;Xc1f6bbbf5;Xd865c4707;Xdc40cee4b;Xdc63e1a31;Xdcffc9ce9;Xe85c6cb6a;Xea4c18296;Xefdec5004,34,Knowledge Maps and Information Retrieval (KMIR),http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7857,2014

1259,"Microblogging is a very popular Internet activity that informs and entertains great multitudes of people world-wide via quickly and scalably disseminated terse messages containing all kinds of newsworthy utterances. Even though microblogging is neither designed nor meant to emphasize privacy, numerous contributors hide behind pseudonyms and compartmentalize their different incarnations via multiple accounts within the same, or across multiple, site(s). Prior work has shown that stylometric analysis is a very powerful tool capable of linking product or service reviews and blogs that are produced by the same author when the number of authors is large. In this paper, we explore linkability of tweets. Our results, based on a very large corpus of tweets, clearly demonstrate that, at least for relatively active tweeters, linkability of tweets by the same author is easily attained even when the number of tweeters is large. We also show that our linkability results hold for a set of actual Twitter users who tweet from multiple accounts. This has some obvious privacy implications, both positive and negative.","Almishari, Mishari;Kaafar, Mohamed Ali;Tsudik, Gene;Oguz, Ekin",ArXiv e-prints,5531155920;X02d27dc1e;X03a71e68d;X067169fe9;X082da3d53;X0be2e420e;X103cfdc64;X19e204f3d;X1b759dd87;X21fb11f02;X22b9862f4;X238fcb6ed;X2c9999107;X2e87ee54f;X32fb82932;X33db9cbf2;X367fdfa8e;X37070586f;X37d1481c3;X3905a54e5;X3ce6b3e97;X3db7250b7;X43b681d11;X47e5f28ea;X4d19fba47;X4f7978ed4;X52ac52ea4;X5a0f6b17f;X5bb9a8ab0;X5c6e647c8;X5d152a4d3;X61e4c97d1;X6328749da;X6599c53c5;X69a88d3e9;X792831853;X82b4baeb3;X85e60f9e0;X86426f636;X877c0271c;X8ae740e1f;X973704f99;X985e4aa45;X986e0f9e3;X9da2844fe;Xa0b5acfdc;Xa29ce3f34;Xa3167a832;Xa393b1675;Xa45966e2c;Xa78605c5d;Xaddf90bd4;Xb1139e996;Xb9cb657c8;Xc3dd59074;Xc888a35e1;Xce721fd80;Xd3ae4f074;Xd8cc67ee2;Xd8f540f87;Xda7b026af;Xdd681fb7b;Xe2a5d28bf;Xe5ee456a9;Xe917ac999;Xee0bfd0e2;Xf3bf0616c;Xfa523b5e4;Xfddfe2b7f;Xff3bdb73f,70,Are 140 Characters Enough?

1260,"The two significant tasks of a focused Web crawler are finding relevant topic-specific documents on the Web and analytically prioritizing them for later effective and reliable download. For the first task, we propose a sophisticated custom algorithm to fetch and analyze the most effective HTML structural elements of the page as well as the topical boundary and anchor text of each unvisited link, based on which the topical focus of an unvisited page can be predicted and elicited with a high accuracy. Thus, our novel method uniquely combines both link-based and content-based approaches. For the second task, we propose a scoring function of the relevant URLs through the use of T-Graph (Treasure Graph) to assist in prioritizing the unvisited links that will later be put into the fetching queue. Our Web search system is called the Treasure-Crawler. This research paper embodies the architectural design of the Treasure-Crawler system which satisfies the principle requirements of a focused Web crawler, and asserts the correctness of the system structure including all its modules through illustrations and by the test results.","Seyfi, Ali",ArXiv e-prints,X136a04e9e;X13c658b68;X1c7f1353c;X4038f9f93;X720ff4fa2;X8604bd20a;X8af959d6c;X9698cb021;Xac3c2be7f;Xca64e2993;Xd9a9cf6cb;Xd9d7b7a24;Xf907fe6ea;Xfdee06fcf,14,A Focused Crawler Combinatory Link and Content Model Based on T-Graph Principles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7265,2013

In the Gutenberg era it was a domain of human experts; in the digital age many machine-based methods, e.g., graph analysis tools and machine-learning techniques, have been developed for it. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a powerful machine-learning approach to semiautomatic speech and language processing, which is also applicable to mathematics. The well established methods of NLP have to be adjusted for the special needs of mathematics, in particular for handling mathematical formulae.

1263,"Each new identified security threat class triggers new research and development efforts by the scientific and professional communities. In this study, we investigate the rate at which the scientific and professional communities react to new identified threat classes as it is reflected in the number of patents, scientific articles and professional publications over a long period of time. The following threat classes were studied: Phishing; SQL Injection; BotNet; Distributed Denial of Service; and Advanced Persistent Threat. Our findings suggest that in most cases it takes a year for the scientific community and more than two years for industry to react to a new threat class with patents. Since new products follow patents, it is reasonable to expect that there will be a window of approximately two to three years in which no effective product is available to cope with the new threat class.","Elovici, Yuval;Rokach, Lior",ArXiv e-prints,X00eccdd41;X10a69a988;X1ffe48483;X28843c0be;X3676cbe6d;X37a8b0a6a;X4650d9359;X54d56b44b;X584e7e222;X6b1f3b689;X6cfb48e69;X775ecc4f1;Xac6aa3e19;Xb2bcd0817;Xbdbaca7b7;Xc4f57a8db;Xd2e5998d8;Xe0a1adcfc,18,Reaction to New Security Threat Class,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3110,2014
1264,"We have implemented the Memento MediaWiki Extension Version 2.0, which brings the Memento Protocol to MediaWiki, used by Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation. Test results show that the extension has a negligible impact on performance. Two 302 status code datetime negotiation patterns, as defined by Memento, have been examined for the extension: Pattern 1.1, which requires 2 requests, versus Pattern 2.1, which requires 3 requests. Our test results and mathematical review find that, contrary to intuition, Pattern 2.1 performs better than Pattern 1.1 due to idiosyncrasies in MediaWiki. In addition to implementing Memento, Version 2.0 allows administrators to choose the optional 200-style datetime negotiation Pattern 1.2 instead of Pattern 2.1. It also permits administrators the ability to have the Memento MediaWiki Extension return full HTTP 400 and 500 status codes rather than using standard MediaWiki error pages. Finally, version 2.0 permits administrators to turn off recommended Memento headers if desired. Seeing as much of our work focuses on producing the correct revision of a wiki page in response to a user's datetime input, we also examine the problem of finding the correct revisions of the embedded resources, including images, stylesheets, and JavaScript; identifying the issues and discussing whether or not MediaWiki must be changed to support this functionality.","Jones, Shawn M.;Nelson, Michael L.;Shankar, Harihar;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,X02d27dc1e;X07bbe0aa2;X1ac2bc2f6;X1b428b7a5;X1d7ed5973;X33189d7b6;X3b6cbc0d7;X4acd61284;X563d992d9;X568b460d0;X5ced38463;X60484320d;X61e4c97d1;X6bfc76615;X6dfcaef66;X6f5d59a64;X839ee7f4b;X83f8602a3;X85c6dd8c2;X8993265dd;X913893f46;X951bc046e;X9636ca0df;X9c604414a;Xafc808e13;Xaff31ce91;Xb76cecd2d;Xbce6323d9;Xbfaa4c83b;Xc12edd595;Xc534c201f;Xceedb1293;Xdab998d42;Xe0ab9583c;Xe2acfc012;Xf03fbbf0e;Xf1e03c917;Xf382d70e5;Xf50724759;Xff9d1b86c,40,Bringing Web Time Travel to MediaWiki: An Assessment of the Memento MediaWiki Extension,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3876,2014
1265,"Genre is considered to be an important element in scholarly communication and in the practice of scientific disciplines. However, scientometric studies have typically focused on a single genre, the journal article. The goal of this study is to understand the role that handbooks play in knowledge creation and diffusion and their relationship with the genre of journal articles, particularly in highly interdisciplinary and emergent social science and humanities disciplines. To shed light on these questions we focused on handbooks and journal articles published over the last four decades belonging to the research area of Science and Technology Studies (STS), broadly defined. To get a detailed picture we used the full-text of five handbooks (500,000 words) and a well-defined set of 11,700 STS articles. We confirmed the methodological split of STS into qualitative and quantitative (scientometric) approaches. Even when the two traditions explore similar topics (e.g., science and gender) they approach them from different starting points. The change in cognitive foci in both handbooks and articles partially reflects the changing trends in STS research, often driven by technology. Using text similarity measures we found that, in the case of STS, handbooks play no special role in either focusing the research efforts or marking their decline. In general, they do not represent the summaries of research directions that have emerged since the previous edition of the handbook.","Milojević, Staša;Sugimoto, Cassidy R.;Larivière, Vincent;Thelwall, Mike;Ding, Ying",ArXiv e-prints,X002b5969e;X0350c7c30;X0a6bb7425;X11101dd1f;X1348c5005;X1696e7f7c;X1ea6a2456;X1eb78e234;X1fdbe0eff;X23971aaca;X24159a9de;X31cc3ee48;X358490012;X36aa4f45b;X3cba90754;X4d6ea951a;X53c6b3df1;X54d56b44b;X59b24dd7e;X6219ca39b;X633b269f2;X64a1957ff;X701912dee;X7668464ed;X815871b40;X82ce26466;X9ae982065;X9bd9fa196;Xa1b994b71;Xa7c85c3e6;Xa80836985;Xa97c8e2fb;Xaa113d269;Xb2ec7c8c7;Xb4c192b27;Xb50e05f0b;Xb6f02196f;Xbe6d6a2ff;Xd0e6e0805;Xd45ce2cc8;Xdddd43064;Xe0b254bae;Xe20a9cd75;Xe917ac999;Xeb5a02bbd;Xecb477080;Xf11e3cf79;Xf16554349;Xf20775ab9,49,The role of handbooks in knowledge creation and diffusion: A case of science and technology studies,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2886,2014

Most existing recommender systems use social filtering methods that base recommendations on other users' preferences. By contrast, content-based methods use information about an item itself to make suggestions. This approach has the advantage of being able to recommended previously unrated items to users with unique interests and to provide explanations for its recommendations. We describe a content-based book recommending system that utilizes information extraction and a machine-learning algorithm for text categorization.

1271,"Since repositories are a key tool in making scholarly knowledge open access, determining their presence and impact on the Web is essential, particularly in Google (search engine par excellence) and Google Scholar (a tool increasingly used by researchers to search for academic information). The few studies conducted so far have been limited to very specific geographic areas (USA), which makes it necessary to find out what is happening in other regions that are not part of mainstream academia, and where repositories play a decisive role in the visibility of scholarly production. The main objective of this study is to ascertain the presence and visibility of Latin American repositories in Google and Google Scholar through the application of page count and visibility indicators. For a sample of 137 repositories, the results indicate that the indexing ratio is low in Google, and virtually nonexistent in Google Scholar; they also indicate a complete lack of correspondence between the repository records and the data produced by these two search tools. These results are mainly attributable to limitations arising from the use of description schemas that are incompatible with Google Scholar (repository design) and the reliability of web indicators (search engines). We conclude that neither Google nor Google Scholar accurately represent the actual size of open access content published by Latin American repositories; this may indicate a non-indexed, hidden side to open access, which could be limiting the dissemination and consumption of open access scholarly literature.","Orduña-Malea, Enrique;Delgado Lopez-Cozar, Emilio",ArXiv e-prints,554615f579;X02a8b31aa;X042130ea6;X051cc22f8;X067e2bb83;X0984b2eb2;X13fd931ff;X1b428b7a5;X1ea86dbaa;X1f0ff3c46;X1f45b3525;X1f49b6377;X20f19cd8d;X26f0c3025;X2a9b11c04;X2e5b137c7;X315447c4f;X362e60f42;X3c23932eb;X4677311da;X4805e0bf9;X49aa950a1;X49cdfede4;X49dfd7873;X4adf822d4;X4e6d2814c;X4fc7fbbc0;X5234e8378;X545d34a8a;X565e1b64a;X61eed6459;X64d4f135e;X69cdc8fbe;X6a4afb19f;X7500389ab;X7668464ed;X789f3bd87;X7d792b5fd;X8019f7279;X812bc3182;X826d267b0;X87c6d0bae;X89499ec0b;X8d4b499db;X8e5a60173;X904f57a8e;X922edbe46;X924405f7c;X92ecb99b2;X938f35cb3;X983e64a12;X9d4e44056;X9f8343b5d;Xa013b3478;Xa1b994b71;Xa5010ebb7;Xa857644a3;Xaa6ca4d5f;Xaa825ad05;Xabb075706;Xabf26ec05;Xb5ca1723a;Xb7fdd27b6;Xbabb83c5c;Xc04e3c849;Xc2fff1b33;Xc8d1c251c;Xce1f571f1;Xce5e0f9f4;Xceb0d1643;Xd8dbf0733;Xdc76425ad;Xdf522a55a;Xeb7041fa2;Xece850f69;Xee3a03d67;Xeeef9dc1c;Xf3ad4ab6d;Xf3bc1fa73;Xf653536a1;Xf6b2725dd;Xf8ec30fa9;Xf978f443a;Xfb228782a;Xfb5cbb115;Xfed04cae9,86,The dark side of Open Access in Google and Google Scholar: the case of Latin-American repositories,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4331,2014

1273,"Finding measures for research impact, be it for individuals, institutions, instruments, or projects, has gained a lot of popularity. There are more papers written than ever on new impact measures, and problems with existing measures are being pointed out on a regular basis. Funding agencies require impact statistics in their reports, job candidates incorporate them in their resumes, and publication metrics have even been used in at least one recent court case. To support this need for research impact indicators, the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) has developed a service that provides a broad overview of various impact measures. In this paper we discuss how the ADS can be used to quench the thirst for impact measures. We will also discuss a couple of the lesser-known indicators in the metrics overview and the main issues to be aware of when compiling publication-based metrics in the ADS, namely author name ambiguity and citation incompleteness.","Henneken, E.

1274,"This article introduces the Multidimensional Research Assessment Matrix of scientific output. Its base notion holds that the choice of metrics to be applied in a research assessment process depends upon the unit of assessment, the research dimension to be assessed, and the purposes and policy context of the assessment. An indicator may by highly useful within one assessment process, but less so in another. For instance, publication counts are useful tools to help discriminating between those staff members who are research active, and those who are not, but are of little value if active scientists are to be compared one another according to their research performance. This paper gives a systematic account of the potential usefulness and limitations of a set of 10 important metrics including altmetrics, applied at the level of individual articles, individual researchers, research groups and institutions. It presents a typology of research impact dimensions, and indicates which metrics are the most appropriate to measure each dimension. It introduces the concept of a meta-analysis of the units under assessment in which metrics are not used as tools to evaluate individual units, but to reach policy inferences regarding the objectives and general setup of an assessment process.","Moed, Henk F.;Halevi, Gali",ArXiv e-prints,5510756933;X077821612;X07b6e119a;X0a479719e;X0a9af5394;X127911863;X15a9c5777;X19c154385;X22068b6c3;X28d2a2065;X30cd2689b;X40c57f4bc;X4249c5158;X46ea474ef;X55a7d70c9;X57d7986f8;X580714b2d;X584d197ba;X5891891ba;X5b557cde0;X64fc11245;X6b1e30aad;X6b937e0d7;X6c74a1aa2;X7d3f03970;X80fc85635;X83c5d7627;X8f09a873c;X8f77db49b;X92c739f44;X95e0b49d4;X965add574;Xa1b994b71;Xa4b4d9cca;Xae7c93e03;Xb50e05f0b;Xb84c3b20d;Xb97e4e523;Xc35d974d2;Xc37feb71b;Xc57539739;Xcab21bb57;Xd485a0097;Xdf0ed05cb;Xe03a3612c;Xe4385e335;Xe704fa940;Xe725b316e;Xe81d83f94;Xe9289ea94;Xeabd21e65;Xee8290620;Xf6b2b6ee9;Xf8046f226;Xf834b519a,55,The Multidimensional Assessment of Scholarly Research Impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5520,2014
1275,"The Shannon-Weaver model of linear information transmission is extended with two loops potentially generating redundancies: (i) meaning is provided locally to the information from the perspective of hindsight, and (ii) meanings can be codified differently and then refer to other horizons of meaning. Thus, three layers are distinguished: variations in the communications, historical organization at each moment of time, and evolutionary self-organization of the codes of communication over time. Furthermore, the codes of communication can functionally be different and then the system is both horizontally and vertically differentiated. All these subdynamics operate in parallel and necessarily generate uncertainty. However, meaningful information can be considered as the specific selection of a signal from the noise; the codes of communication are social constructs that can generate redundancy by giving different meanings to the same information. Reflexively, one can translate among codes in more elaborate discourses. The second (instantiating) layer can be operationalized in terms of semantic maps using the vector space model; the third in terms of mutual redundancy among the latent dimensions of the vector space. Using Blaise Cronin's {\oe}uvre, the different operations of the three layers are demonstrated empirically.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X07bbe0aa2;X139c8d6b8;X1a0dbe0b8;X1b3365cea;X249b64bf4;X24ac3aa7c;X257f6ef97;X2a1bcc995;X2a4fd7af2;X2f1bd3c0d;X3351fbe3f;X34b080157;X3523dcc37;X3580d2232;X4149febfd;X42742c846;X457e0b687;X46ea474ef;X471fc699a;X4bdca64d5;X55081a2a3;X5ca62cd46;X5f2e868ae;X60b91feb5;X636539ee5;X6b161e37c;X6d95a569b;X6e1cbbd64;X720f6ecf7;X728f04e8b;X768e9de90;X79204125a;X7c7c07922;X7d317a494;X7e7669fe3;X803a0477b;X8392d9002;X84933f170;X851a46f23;X868e11c94;X8a7c56b55;X95db2f71f;X9660c73cc;X96f2e38b3;X98f8a817d;X99e8cc8cd;X9bc2e85d9;Xa1af4b0b8;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa7ee24af6;Xa817be20c;Xa9157de34;Xa947b3a78;Xad4fcb318;Xae25eb2d6;Xb06aa336d;Xb17e4cde8;Xb3510f4e7;Xb38baa5a8;Xb42f88714;Xbf093e919;Xc9ec999e1;Xcb6c2cdfc;Xd07747c99;Xd1dfaf21f;Xd59511732;Xd5a1003dc;Xd7dce6a2c;Xd9e4cd0e9;Xdc9c52ad9;Xde0e19b12;Xdee786d5e;Xdfef3f3bf;Xe9682c93b;Xe998a58d5;Xec16c6053;Xf18b22127;Xf51a8f058;Xf8451dd70;Xfa9da3395;Xfe5534078;Xfee7d102c,82,"Information, Meaning, and Intellectual Organization in Networks of Inter-Human Communication",http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5688,2014

One uses structure, so is applicable to a fully `Tagged PDF' context, while the other uses /AF tagging of the relevant content. The third method requires no tagging at all, instead including the source coding as the /ActualText replacement of a so-called `fake space'.

1278,"The goal of our research is to understand how ideas propagate, combine and are created in large social networks. In this work, we look at a sample of relevant scientific publications in the area of high-frequency analog circuit design and their citation distribution. A novel aspect of our work is the way in which we categorize citations based on the reason and place of it in a publication. We created seven citation categories from general domain references, references to specific methods used in the same domain problem, references to an analysis method, references for experimental comparison and so on. This added information allows us to define two new measures to characterize the creativity (novelty and usefulness) of a publication based on its pattern of citations clustered by reason, place and citing scientific group. We analyzed 30 publications in relevant journals since 2000 and their about 300 citations, all in the area of high-frequency analog circuit design. We observed that the number of citations a publication receives from different scientific groups matches a Levy type distribution: with a large number of groups citing a publication relatively few times, and a very small number of groups citing a publication a large number of times. We looked at the motifs a publication is cited differently by different scientific groups.","Doboli, Simona;Zhao, Fanshu;Doboli, Alex",ArXiv e-prints,509ac2f300;X1d3ba23e8;X30cd2689b;X3b82f5d6e;X3ebb18fd8;X3f5c170c3;X4def7017e;X50115df58;X5d745b51a;X6a43198d2;X6d0b81629;Xa654ebc3f;Xc4811ea5d;Xc89285119;Xdad6086b8;Xdf34a9856;Xe676c2b33;Xf996f4ca2;Xfb2fe48d6,19,New measures for evaluating creativity in scientific publications,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7582,2014
1279,"The h-index is a popular bibliometric indicator for assessing individual scientists. We criticize the h-index from a theoretical point of view. We argue that for the purpose of measuring the overall scientific impact of a scientist (or some other unit of analysis) the h-index behaves in a counterintuitive way. In certain cases, the mechanism used by the h-index to aggregate publication and citation statistics into a single number leads to inconsistencies in the way in which scientists are ranked. Our conclusion is that the h-index cannot be considered an appropriate indicator of a scientist's overall scientific impact. Based on recent theoretical insights, we discuss what kind of indicators can be used as an alternative to the h-index. We pay special attention to the highly cited publications indicator.

1280,"We explore the availability and persistence of URLs cited in articles published in D-Lib Magazine. We extracted 4387 unique URLs referenced in 453 articles published from July 1995 to August 2004. The availability was checked three times a week for 25 weeks from September 2004 to February 2005. We found that approximately 28% of those URLs failed to resolve initially, and 30% failed to resolve at the last check. A majority of the unresolved URLs were due to 404 (page not found) and 500 (internal server error) errors. The content pointed to by the URLs was relatively stable; only 16% of the content registered more than a 1 KB change during the testing period. We explore possible factors which may cause a URL to fail by examining its age, path depth, top-level domain and file extension. Based on the data collected, we found the half-life of a URL referenced in a D-Lib Magazine article is approximately 10 years. We also found that URLs were more likely to be unavailable if they pointed to resources in the .net, .edu or country-specific top-level domain, used non-standard ports (i.e., not port 80), or pointed to resources with uncommon or deprecated extensions (e.g., .shtml, .ps, .txt).","McCown, Frank;Chan, Sheffan;Nelson, Michael L.;Bollen, Johan",ArXiv e-prints,X0f4dbc6ba;X29527279b;X2ef8a4546;X3cc762420;X5a72e6a96;X7336ddcf9;X7c42e8ee0;X95a3ba66b;X97e59817d;Xa43e1a37e;Xa52970ffe;Xadd66b30a;Xbaadac1a7;Xd3abb26be;Xf1b0abc16;Xf42951425,16,The Availability and Persistence of Web References in D-Lib Magazine,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0511077,2005
1281,"Can altmetric data be validly used for the measurement of societal impact? The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag ""good for teaching"" do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented (""new finding""). The findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact. If altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization. In bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers' subject area and publication year. This study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely reflected in Thomson Reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of topics.","Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X060b02504;X066efb484;X06b50dbf8;X0791c60e6;X0af8b8078;X0b559beb5;X2b70e1bf4;X2ca593f2d;X2d00765ce;X2d5ac6208;X2f909457b;X3285c7845;X32be3589f;X348814447;X39dfe0f6d;X3ebb18fd8;X42b7f6186;X4854dfb3e;X513d0a6dc;X51d210228;X5c8fa2b8c;X5d0d2cba9;X625cbbd25;X67b1432b7;X68a010205;X6ba7866f1;X7b83eded2;X7d3f03970;X7e6b2903f;X7f4aef04f;X82690b573;X911fc3e5f;X931d6478d;X96f2e38b3;X996930ed3;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa654ebc3f;Xa82d2fd79;Xb6a33544c;Xb739f61d1;Xb7b3e6af4;Xbd74722d2;Xc069f6bff;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xccd88aa61;Xd1abe56a7;Xdd9a378c9;Xe02452e3b;Xe03d9c70d;Xec8e900fe;Xfafd1722a;Xffe64f404,53,Validity of altmetrics data for measuring societal impact: A study using data from Altmetric and F1000Prime,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7611,2014
1282,"Searching for concepts in science and technology is often a difficult task. To facilitate concept search, different types of human-generated metadata have been created to define the content of scientific and technical disclosures. Classification schemes such as the International Patent Classification (IPC) and MEDLINE's MeSH are structured and controlled, but require trained experts and central management to restrict ambiguity (Mork, 2013). While unstructured tags of folksonomies can be processed to produce a degree of structure (Kalendar, 2010; Karampinas, 2012; Sarasua, 2012; Bragg, 2013) the freedom enjoyed by the crowd typically results in less precision (Stock 2007). Existing classification schemes suffer from inflexibility and ambiguity. Since humans understand language, inference, implication, abstraction and hence concepts better than computers, we propose to harness the collective wisdom of the crowd. To do so, we propose a novel classification scheme that is sufficiently intuitive for the crowd to use, yet powerful enough to facilitate search by analogy, and flexible enough to deal with ambiguity. The system will enhance existing classification information. Linking up with the semantic web and computer intelligence, a Citizen Science effort (Good, 2013) would support innovation by improving the quality of granted patents, reducing duplicitous research, and stimulating problem-oriented solution design. A prototype of our design is in preparation.

1284,"In natural language, words and phrases themselves imply the semantics. In contrast, the meaning of identifiers in mathematical formulae is undefined. Thus scientists must study the context to decode the meaning. The Mathematical Language Processing (MLP) project aims to support that process. In this paper, we compare two approaches to discover identifier-definition tuples. At first we use a simple pattern matching approach. Second, we present the MLP approach that uses part-of-speech tag based distances as well as sentence positions to calculate identifier-definition probabilities. The evaluation of our prototypical system, applied on the Wikipedia text corpus, shows that our approach augments the user experience substantially. While hovering the identifiers in the formula, tool-tips with the most probable definitions occur. Tests with random samples show that the displayed definitions provide a good match with the actual meaning of the identifiers.","Pagael, Robert;Schubotz, Moritz",ArXiv e-prints,X07b15e949;X127c3bb16;X12c939ac5;X15febf97f;X1825fb064;X19a5b6599;X1b428b7a5;X293666940;X3d55cad37;X6643ca21d;X6c173a8c6;X6f0135800;X70c2babfc;X74f9de4de;X94f21253b;Xd9aa8193b;Xde9c1a785;Xe69579e2a;Xf3b3ff1a2;Xf471572a3,20,Mathematical Language Processing Project,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0167,2014
1285,"We investigate the extent to which advances in the health and life sciences (HLS) are dependent on research in the engineering and physical sciences (EPS), particularly physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering. The analysis combines two different bibliometric approaches. The first approach to analyze the 'EPS-HLS interface' is based on term map visualizations of HLS research fields. We consider 16 clinical fields and five life science fields. On the basis of expert judgment, EPS research in these fields is studied by identifying EPS-related terms in the term maps. In the second approach, a large-scale citation-based network analysis is applied to publications from all fields of science. We work with about 22,000 clusters of publications, each representing a topic in the scientific literature. Citation relations are used to identify topics at the EPS-HLS interface. The two approaches complement each other. The advantages of working with textual data compensate for the limitations of working with citation relations and the other way around. An important advantage of working with textual data is in the in-depth qualitative insights it provides. Working with citation relations, on the other hand, yields many relevant quantitative statistics. We find that EPS research contributes to HLS developments mainly in the following five ways: new materials and their properties; chemical methods for analysis and molecular synthesis; imaging of parts of the body as well as of biomaterial surfaces; medical engineering mainly related to imaging, radiation therapy, signal processing technology, and other medical instrumentation; mathematical and statistical methods for data analysis. In our analysis, about 10% of all EPS and HLS publications are classified as being at the EPS-HLS interface. This percentage has remained more or less constant during the past decade.","Waltman, Ludo;van Raan, Anthony F.

1288,"Researchers or students entering a emerging research area are particularly interested in what newly published papers will be most cited and which young researchers will become influential in the future, so that they can catch the most recent advances and find valuable research directions. However, predicting the future importance of scientific articles and authors is challenging due to the dynamic nature of literature networks and evolving research topics. Different from most previous studies aiming to rank the current importance of literatures and authors, we focus on \emph{ranking the future popularity of new publications and young researchers} by proposing a unified ranking model to combine various available information. Specifically, we first propose to extract two kinds of text features, words and words co-occurrence to characterize innovative papers and authors. Then, instead of using static and un-weighted graphs, we construct time-aware weighted graphs to distinguish the various importance of links established at different time. Finally, by leveraging both the constructed text features and graphs, we propose a mutual reinforcement ranking framework called \emph{MRFRank} to rank the future importance of papers and authors simultaneously. Experimental results on the ArnetMiner dataset show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baselines on the metric \emph{recommendation intensity}.","Wang, Senzhang;Xie, Sihong;Zhang, Xiaoming;Li, Zhoujun;Yu, Philip S.;Shu, Xinyu",ArXiv e-prints,X0663870a7;X1987e5549;X249a651bb;X3923962e7;X3aa878472;X699f11a48;X6d28f4b80;X7404d0d89;X8b9480e3a;X8ca5be904;X9210931e7;X96e33ceb2;Xa4215e246;Xbe4e39122;Xc381f2934;Xc3be2881a;Xc455fa8a0;Xc79321380;Xcd12d21a7;Xdad6086b8;Xe15cc9e63;Xe4364a182;Xe5ab9a5fd;Xe7591424a,24,Future Influence Ranking of Scientific Literature,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1772,2014
1289,"The process of documenting and describing the world's languages is undergoing radical transformation with the rapid uptake of new digital technologies for capture, storage, annotation and dissemination. However, uncritical adoption of new tools and technologies is leading to resources that are difficult to reuse and which are less portable than the conventional printed resources they replace. We begin by reviewing current uses of software tools and digital technologies for language documentation and description. This sheds light on how digital language documentation and description are created and managed, leading to an analysis of seven portability problems under the following headings: content, format, discovery, access, citation, preservation and rights. After characterizing each problem we provide a series of value statements, and this provides the framework for a broad range of best practice recommendations.","Bird, Steven;Simons, Gary",ArXiv e-prints,X111075acf;X1c8a00c9a;X211e298d9;X3ccfa890d;X3f12ea6e5;X3f4b66759;X4178f5cde;X4aca07190;X4e4a5fde4;X62445b6cb;X812bc3182;Xa3a499dc1;Xb4da54685;Xbadf6241d;Xc538e79ae;Xcf87367d7;Xe66df6838;Xff4f16b69,18,Seven Dimensions of Portability for Language Documentation and Description,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0204020,2002
1290,"Today, it is not clear how the impact of research on other areas of society than science should be measured. While peer review and bibliometrics have become standard methods for measuring the impact of research in science, there is not yet an accepted framework within which to measure societal impact. Alternative metrics (called altmetrics to distinguish them from bibliometrics) are considered an interesting option for assessing the societal impact of research, as they offer new ways to measure (public) engagement with research output. Altmetrics is a term to describe web-based metrics for the impact of publications and other scholarly material by using data from social media platforms (e.g. Twitter or Mendeley). This overview of studies explores the potential of altmetrics for measuring societal impact. It deals with the definition and classification of altmetrics.

1291,"Biomedical taxonomies, thesauri and ontologies in the form of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) as a taxonomy or the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus as an OWL-based ontology, play a critical role in acquiring, representing and processing information about human health. With increasing adoption and relevance, biomedical ontologies have also significantly increased in size. For example, the 11th revision of the ICD, which is currently under active development by the WHO contains nearly 50,000 classes representing a vast variety of different diseases and causes of death. This evolution in terms of size was accompanied by an evolution in the way ontologies are engineered. Because no single individual has the expertise to develop such large-scale ontologies, ontology-engineering projects have evolved from small-scale efforts involving just a few domain experts to large-scale projects that require effective collaboration between dozens or even hundreds of experts, practitioners and other stakeholders. Understanding how these stakeholders collaborate will enable us to improve editing environments that support such collaborations. We uncover how large ontology-engineering projects, such as the ICD in its 11th revision, unfold by analyzing usage logs of five different biomedical ontology-engineering projects of varying sizes and scopes using Markov chains. We discover intriguing interaction patterns (e.g., which properties users subsequently change) that suggest that large collaborative ontology-engineering projects are governed by a few general principles that determine and drive development. From our analysis, we identify commonalities and differences between different projects that have implications for project managers, ontology editors, developers and contributors working on collaborative ontology-engineering projects and tools in the biomedical domain.","Walk, Simon;Singer, Philipp;Strohmaier, Markus;Tudorache, Tania;Musen, Mark A.;Noy, Natalya F.",ArXiv e-prints,X12ef57a45;X14a67e031;X1b428b7a5;X263063655;X29c2635df;X2ccb8be2a;X309f0eeee;X423fa0b5d;X450853ca8;X4f9f58cd7;X527eaf409;X73ce862db;X7b1c41bcd;X7d676506a;X8fc1ad37f;X9bfd949e2;X9c46fdb05;Xbc01b2a2c;Xc1f6bbbf5;Xca4874172;Xd066986ea;Xd073d00a5;Xe462ee0b0,23,Discovering Beaten Paths in Collaborative Ontology-Engineering Projects using Markov Chains,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2002,2014
1292,"This article is a contribution towards an understanding of Open Access (OA) publishing. It proposes an analysis framework of 18 core attributes, divided into the areas of Bibliographic information, Activity metrics, Economics, Accessibility, and Predatory issues of OA journals. The framework has been employed in a systematic analysis of 30 OA journals in software engineering (SE) and information systems (IS), which were selected among 386 OA journals in Computer Science from the Directory of OA Journals. An analysis is performed on the sample of the journals, to provide an overview of the current situation of OA journals in the fields of SE and IS. The journals are then compared between-group, according to the presence of a publication fee. A within-group analysis is performed on the journals requesting publication charges to authors, in order to understand what is the value added according to different price ranges. This article offers several contributions. It presents an overview of OA definitions and models. It provides an analysis framework born from the observation of data and the literature. It raises the need to study OA in the fields of SE and IS while offering a first analysis. Finally, it provides recommendations to readers of OA journals. This paper highlights several concerns still threatening OA publishing in the fields of SE and IS. Among them, it is shown that high publication fees are not sufficiently justified by the publishers, which often lack transparency and may prevent authors from adopting OA.","Graziotin, Daniel;Wang, Xiaofeng;Abrahamsson, Pekka",ArXiv e-prints,X039f1a5e9;X064d0b8b5;X06d4e3293;X10a71e5f0;X1324562f5;X155e47054;X1fd47879f;X2086f9921;X231c7ac89;X25a1a8e01;X28f522161;X29fb114cb;X2a0ab0cf0;X2b18d86e4;X2c3f21871;X32751b227;X382272679;X3aa8b8001;X3d5f09d03;X3f148e508;X4edf47754;X4ee764371;X525cbc0e3;X53435fb91;X53585ff24;X67994f1c6;X6b59d2fc2;X6ba02dd1d;X6c381c942;X707297e5a;X7a0e803f9;X9d50d7223;Xa1b994b71;Xa65a4123e;Xa6f5ecf6b;Xa708d0e7a;Xa7c6cca53;Xa85e289b4;Xa8fd41c63;Xaa2050d2b;Xb33cf29e2;Xb473f13b2;Xb7779309e;Xbdd7cb30b;Xc30093a6d;Xc6fec0dfb;Xc867eb555;Xcac50cc35;Xcc905ed91;Xcf107b704;Xd49fde693;Xd7c58642d;Xd93b9b9b2;Xde697f0d6;Xe0040c6e3;Xe132f3167;Xe20d585c6;Xe25f1af81;Xe29b0a897;Xe31dfb387;Xe679b94e1;Xe8b9a2df3;Xefc0bad29;Xf156d062f;Xf18fcab33;Xf4cf5f51c;Xf4d888f12;Xf7132cdad;Xfd76536a2,69,A framework for systematic analysis of Open Access journals and its application in software engineering and information systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2597,2013

1294,"In this work, we aim to understand the mechanisms driving academic collaboration. We begin by building a model for how researchers split their effort between multiple papers, and how collaboration affects the number of citations a paper receives, supported by observations from a large real-world publication and citation dataset, which we call the h-Reinvestment model. Using tools from the field of Game Theory, we study researchers' collaborative behavior over time under this model, with the premise that each researcher wants to maximize his or her academic success. We find analytically that there is a strong incentive to collaborate rather than work in isolation, and that studying collaborative behavior through a game-theoretic lens is a promising approach to help us better understand the nature and dynamics of academic collaboration.","Cormode, Graham;Ma, Qiang;Muthukrishnan, S.;Thompson, Brian",ArXiv e-prints,X1aa857b6a;X2de0b6f44;X3212a7b18;X61896ae07;X81f206011;X82dad644f;X83795c9ca;X9ab1adb1c;Xb1aaa6a73;Xb4efc45a2;Xc4811ea5d;Xe8d165320;Xecfc670cc;Xf2ae37ad0,14,Modeling Collaboration in Academia: A Game Theoretic Approach,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2220,2014
1295,"Web accessible content stored in obscure, unpopular or obsolete formats represents a significant problem for digital preservation. The file formats that encode web content represent the implicit and explicit choices of web site maintainers at a particular point in time. Older file formats that have fallen out of favor are obviously a problem, but so are new file formats that have not yet been fully supported by browsers. Often browsers use plug-in software for displaying old and new formats, but plug-ins can be difficult to find, install and replicate across all environments that one may use. We introduce Grace, an http proxy server that transparently converts browser-incompatible and obsolete web content into web content that a browser is able to display without the use of plug-ins. Grace is configurable on a per user basis and can be expanded to provide an array of conversion services. We illustrate how the Grace prototype transforms several image formats (XBM, PNG with various alpha channels, and JPEG 2000) so they are viewable in Internet Explorer.","Swaney, Daniel S.;McCown, Frank;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X8f83a0f0f;Xa506d1b89;Xd3abb26be;Xf3ad13206;Xf45bf7b82,5,Dynamic Web File Format Transformations with Grace,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0512068,2005

1298,"We analyse the main features of the third edition of Google Scholar Metrics (GSM), released in June 2014, focusing on its more important changes, strengths, and weaknesses. Additionally, we present some figures that outline the dimensions of this new edition, and we compare them to those of previous editions. Principal among these figures are the number of visualized publications, publication types, languages, and the maximum and minimum h5-index and h5-median values by language, subject area, and subcategory. This new edition is marked by continuity. There is nothing new other than the updating of the time frame (2009-2013) and the removal of some redundant subcategories (from 268 to 261) for English written publications. Google has just updated the data, which means that some of the errors discussed in previous studies still persist. To sum up, GSM is a minimalist information product with few features, closed (it cannot be customized by the user), and simple (navigating it only takes a few clicks). For these reasons, we consider it a 'low cost' bibliometric tool, and propose a list of features it should incorporate in order to stop being labeled as such. Notwithstanding the above, this product presents a stability in its bibliometric indicators that supports its ability to measure and track the impact of scientific publications.","Martín-Martín, Alberto;Ayllón, Juan Manuel;Orduña-Malea, Enrique;Delgado López-Cózar, Emilio",ArXiv e-prints,5542d8fe27;X0256234df;X042c7a307;X0adf1e524;X0b807c039;X10b562453;X12e0f4116;X1cafa0d04;X21cceeea4;X23da3f73c;X38575e34c;X3eb3e137c;X42612ec83;X485d4fabc;X499d80eec;X4aebff76f;X5020057a9;X565e1b64a;X580c6c903;X58af12aaa;X59884343a;X5c8fa2b8c;X6652c94f8;X7a77afdb5;X7ca6f59f9;X811c2d331;X8c8d3eafd;X94775d3a8;X9898ffe69;X98a987b50;X9a0e5c5ff;X9ace5265a;X9db456645;X9df372da8;X9ff4b66f8;Xa1b994b71;Xa24262ed1;Xa560b9606;Xa6bf33243;Xab01a1fa1;Xaf362c2d4;Xb59985b05;Xb6702720c;Xb7aecf7bc;Xc0169755b;Xc0bf897dd;Xc108b52b7;Xc68bedf85;Xc872e2c99;Xce4ff1876;Xce691d640;Xd151a424c;Xdf0d828ac;Xe57052b10;Xea914f35f;Xeb37d8592;Xec68c41aa;Xf11732c01;Xf729691b1;Xf7a6740a1;Xf8dd19661;Xf98130882;Xf9989aecb;Xfa8675101;Xfd0def7b3,65,Google Scholar Metrics 2014: a low cost bibliometric tool,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2827,2014
1299,"This study analyzes rates and ways of data sharing regarding mitochondrial, Y chromosomal and autosomal polymorphisms in a total of 162 papers on human ancient DNA published between 1988 and 2013. For the most part, data are available in such a way as to make their scrutiny and reuse possible. The estimated sharing rate is not far from totality (97.6% +/- 2.1%) and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic research (Evolutionary, Medical and Forensic Genetics). A questionnaire-based survey suggests that the authors awareness of the importance of openness and transparency for scientific progress is a fundamental factor for the achievement of such a high sharing rate. Most data were made available through body text, but the use of primary databases increased with the application of complete mitochondrial and next generation sequencing methods. Our study highlights three important aspects. First, we provide evidence that researchers motivations are as necessary as stakeholders policies and norms to achieve very high sharing rates. Second, careful analyses of the ways in which data are made available are an important first step to maximize data findability, accessibility, useability and preservation. Third and finally, the case of human ancient DNA studies demonstrates how Open Science can foster scientific advancements, showing that openness and transparency can help build rigorous and reliable scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental challenges.","Anagnostou, Paolo;Capocasa, Marco;Milia, Nicola;Sanna, Emanuele;Luzi, Daniela;Destro Bisol, Giovanni",ArXiv e-prints,X05c912117;X073895735;X07681683c;X1353afc82;X1fe866a88;X35e9dff33;X54f74b5e9;X5f98c805f;X697f36432;X6e9bf5238;X7149d9ef4;X825bc1bbb;X8a1e7b5c6;X8e22fabfe;X8fbf8cad5;Xa35672650;Xc039b4d47;Xc4c0ad844;Xc53c50bbb;Xde0e19b12,20,When data sharing gets close to 100%: what ancient human DNA studies can teach the Open Science movement,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3682,2014

Even though the VO adopted technologies in particular from the bibliographic community where available, building the Registry system involved a major standardisation effort, involving about a dozen interdependent standard texts. This paper discusses the server-side aspects of the standards and their application, as regards the functional components (registries), the resource records in both format and content, the exchange of resource records between registries (harvesting), as well as the creation and management of the identifiers used in the system based on the notion of authorities. Registry record authors, registry operators or even advanced users thus receive a big picture serving as a guideline through the body of relevant standard texts. To complete this picture, we also mention common usage patterns and open issues as appropriate.","Demleitner, M.;Greene, G.;Le Sidaner, P.;Plante, R.

1302,"We present an efficient and effective automatic method for determining the research focus of scientific communities found in co-authorship networks. It utilizes bibliographic data from a database to form the network, followed by fastgreedy community detection to identify communities within large connected components of the network. Text analysis techniques are used to identify community-specific significant terms which represent the topic of the community. In order to greatly reduce computation time, the `Topics' field of each publication in the network is analyzed rather than its entire text. Using this text analysis approach requires a certain level of statistical confidence,therefore analyzing very small communities is not effective with this technique. We find a minimum community size threshold of 8 coauthored papers; below this value, the community's topic cannot be reliably identified with this method. Additionally, we consider the implications this study has regarding factors involved in the formation of scientific communities in co-authorship networks.","Durante, Joe;Whitehouse, Tyler;Serpa, F.

1305,"Background: With the ever increasing use of computational models in the biosciences, the need to share models and reproduce the results of published studies efficiently and easily is becoming more important. To this end, various standards have been proposed that can be used to describe models, simulations, data or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute various separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific result. Results: We describe the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Together with the use of other standard formats from the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive, a single file that supports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and simulation experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes a manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file adding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing the model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in COMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined by an Internet Media Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are available, either as independent libraries or embedded in modeling software. Conclusions: The COMBINE Archive facilitates the reproduction of modeling and simulation experiments in biology by embedding all the relevant information in one file. Having all the information stored and exchanged at once also helps in building activity logs and audit trails. We anticipate that the COMBINE Archive will become a significant help for modellers, as the domain moves to larger, more complex experiments such as multi-scale models of organs, digital organisms, and bioengineering.","Bergmann, Frank T.;Adams, Richard;Moodie, Stuart;Cooper, Jonathan;Glont, Mihai;Golebiewski, Martin;Hucka, Michael;Laibe, Camille;Miller, Andrew K.;Nickerson, David P.;Olivier, Brett G.;Rodriguez, Nicolas;Sauro, Herbert M.;Scharm, Martin;Soiland-Reyes, Stian;Waltemath, Dagmar;Yvon, Florent;Le Novère, Nicolas",ArXiv e-prints,X06f7eeda5;X0cac83350;X0d27baae2;X2e5b137c7;X301c33e71;X4634ca971;X49aa950a1;X4dd7f6302;X4f8f01262;X520c48a12;X5d9c2d5fb;X5f811b10c;X6797bdd63;X73edeb3ca;X855a5b096;X87fa70e21;X8c492e948;X8e2fcd7d2;X941bd44f6;X9e8622433;Xa0ffb6ec1;Xa482b079c;Xa5010ebb7;Xa654ebc3f;Xb56f7cf10;Xc1dd3a68b;Xc4d2679c5;Xc4e088631;Xc8e31cf40;Xd7de55145;Xdf5fbc798,31,One file to share them all: Using the COMBINE Archive and the OMEX format to share all information about a modeling project,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4992,2014
1306,"Science and engineering research increasingly relies on activities that facilitate research but are not currently rewarded or recognized, such as: data sharing; developing common data resources, software and methodologies; and annotating data and publications. To promote and advance these activities, we must develop mechanisms for assigning credit, facilitate the appropriate attribution of research outcomes, devise incentives for activities that facilitate research, and allocate funds to maximize return on investment. In this article, we focus on addressing the issue of assigning credit for both direct and indirect contributions, specifically by using JSON-LD to implement a prototype transitive credit system.","Katz, Daniel S.;Smith, Arfon M.",ArXiv e-prints,54ef3f37be;X0851a8856;X0ae53b5cb;X0f672634b;X179e4651b;X1a37afc1c;X21d56f2c3;X268541f55;X2a34eb133;X362e60f42;X39f5e723f;X3f7065743;X41a824eb7;X4879ac23e;X4c63b472e;X4e6562377;X59ae3c252;X5d4d014e5;X61ddb7529;X6338a2696;X6428b7e1d;X76d1cfd2f;X7d3f03970;X85e15a531;X89845e89a;X9286411af;X9827d7f9c;X9db9cea94;Xa2224b2a6;Xa4ecd3049;Xa654ebc3f;Xa72cceefa;Xa8eb40092;Xad66e866e;Xaed3a39bb;Xb71c2a671;Xc01a098b9;Xc166f8bc4;Xc9bac80a6;Xd362d7b40;Xd69b98c13;Xe695307af;Xe9dc8099c;Xea9d21c88;Xf5436f20b;Xf7d690f0a;Xf959cde6a;Xfc6fa03ca,48,Implementing Transitive Credit with JSON-LD,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5117,2014
1307,"What lessons can be learned from examining numerous efforts to create a repository or directory of scientist-written software for a discipline? Astronomy has seen a number of efforts to build such a resource, one of which is the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL). The ASCL (ascl.net) was founded in 1999, had a period of dormancy, and was restarted in 2010. When taking over responsibility for the ASCL in 2010, the new editor sought to answer the opening question, hoping this would better inform the work to be done.

1308,"Indexing the Web is becoming a laborious task for search engines as the Web exponentially grows in size and distribution. Presently, the most effective known approach to overcome this problem is the use of focused crawlers. A focused crawler applies a proper algorithm in order to detect the pages on the Web that relate to its topic of interest. For this purpose we proposed a custom method that uses specific HTML elements of a page to predict the topical focus of all the pages that have an unvisited link within the current page. These recognized on-topic pages have to be sorted later based on their relevance to the main topic of the crawler for further actual downloads. In the Treasure-Crawler, we use a hierarchical structure called the T-Graph which is an exemplary guide to assign appropriate priority score to each unvisited link. These URLs will later be downloaded based on this priority. This paper outlines the architectural design and embodies the implementation, test results and performance evaluation of the Treasure-Crawler system. The Treasure-Crawler is evaluated in terms of information retrieval criteria such as recall and precision, both with values close to 0.5. Gaining such outcome asserts the significance of the proposed approach.","Seyfi, Ali",ArXiv e-prints,X042c6900e;X377e32eea;X4202361a2;X460974024;X48683c01b;X4c9614e32;X6230f5c70;X6664f44ab;X6b59d2fc2;X6d0fd23bf;X74dbd2b77;X785816b7e;X9991f71e5;Xbc48623d5;Xc2fff1b33;Xca64e2993;Xf24bc00fc,17,Analysis and Evaluation of the Link and Content Based Focused Treasure-Crawler,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0054,2013

Intuitive expectations about evolution of an adequate classification scheme for a growing set of objects are formulated. Evolution compliant with these expectations is called natural.

1310,"The emergence of academic search engines (Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search essentially) has revived and increased the interest in the size of the academic web, since their aspiration is to index the entirety of current academic knowledge. The search engine functionality and human search patterns lead us to believe, sometimes, that what you see in the search engine's results page is all that really exists. And, even when this is not true, we wonder which information is missing and why. The main objective of this working paper is to calculate the size of Google Scholar at present (May 2014). To do this, we present, apply and discuss up to 4 empirical methods: Khabsa & Giles's method, an estimate based on empirical data, and estimates based on direct queries and absurd queries. The results, despite providing disparate values, place the estimated size of Google Scholar in about 160 million documents. However, the fact that all methods show great inconsistencies, limitations and uncertainties, makes us wonder why Google does not simply provide this information to the scientific community if the company really knows this figure.","Orduña-Malea, Enrique;Ayllón, Juan Manuel;Martín-Martín, Alberto;Delgado López-Cózar, Emilio",ArXiv e-prints,X01439a4d7;X0256234df;X0580bac19;X0787686bb;X0b1a30a86;X0d0b69b47;X0fffce86d;X108811ab4;X11bc3f9b4;X12884a1b2;X13dad70fd;X178ea162c;X18b13a6ca;X1abb5ffc8;X1b428b7a5;X1bbbd8613;X2059bb12e;X226673b0d;X239658e27;X25b305a8c;X2ba482ce5;X2d3306bf0;X32565890b;X35695d58a;X35f0d3d88;X36f9332bc;X37e2f1061;X384ced0ae;X38614d950;X3996927a8;X3c3ed4695;X3f82c45ef;X42df10c49;X46fb95132;X4853d2b70;X488a80e62;X4dfdb0b86;X4f9b7b169;X5253f0d4d;X546267895;X55b7199d2;X5662b99c0;X56b688d7f;X579a20024;X584c50b14;X5928be3c4;X5a384ef75;X5ad8b302d;X5c1246532;X61e2adc1e;X65733c005;X661b9cab7;X6e9975bb8;X707b60220;X742ed524b;X7574a65b4;X760d5d727;X785816b7e;X787aa476d;X7a0994e6b;X7a71abe8b;X7b4a1414c;X7ca6f59f9;X7fa883607;X7fc38d7d5;X8089fbaa6;X838428dba;X83f419d74;X86c487c6e;X88834748e;X8aeadcbd9;X8b7a9b464;X8dacf3fab;X8e7eba6bb;X953f0c061;X9587b1eae;X964515ecd;X9736160a3;X99496f56d;X996e7ff88;X9a5ef5e60;X9c2f15b32;X9deda4dfd;X9fbfa548b;Xa1b994b71;Xa1bd372c7;Xa5c16349c;Xa8e439883;Xa90bf14d2;Xab01a1fa1;Xac874cade;Xb2bcd0817;Xb3266a83b;Xb59985b05;Xb64290632;Xb6702720c;Xb75b0177f;Xbcc5505a8;Xbdd0a504c;Xc05b212ea;Xc68bedf85;Xc74054d79;Xc9c2aac95;Xca20dbb99;Xccc3dbefd;Xceb0d1643;Xcf31c2323;Xcfe1670e9;Xcff723c47;Xd0adb12ba;Xd20c0716d;Xd253d8273;Xd339a4108;Xd568de2b6;Xd78419860;Xd86349da7;Xd8efb86bd;Xda2df06dd;Xe13c5b01a;Xe283ff618;Xe7be3c748;Xeb6b2c084;Xeff742dfc;Xf1546dd34;Xf1b0abc16;Xf56e1ed16;Xf883de70f;Xff7690535,128,About the size of Google Scholar: playing the numbers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6239,2014

Inspired by the concept of maps of science, i.e. mapping scientific topics to a scientific space, we ask which topological structure a dynamical process of authors collaborating and publishing papers can generate. We propose a dynamical process where papers as well as new groups receive topical positions embedded in a two-dimensional euclidean space. The precise position of new papers depends on previous topics of the respective authors and is chosen randomly in a surrounding neighborhood including novelty and interdisciplinarity. Depending on parameters, the spatial structure resembles a simple Gaussian distribution, or spatial clusters of side-topics are observed.

Since the research was particularly interested in the correlation between altmetrics counts and citation counts, this overview focuses particularly on this correlation. For each altmetric, a meta-analysis is calculated for its correlation with traditional citation counts. As the results of the meta-analyses show, the correlation with traditional citations for micro-blogging counts is negligible (pooled r=0.003), for blog counts it is small (pooled r=0.12) and for bookmark counts from online reference managers, medium to large (CiteULike pooled r=0.23; Mendeley pooled r=0.51).","Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X00d6262a1;X02aeeaff3;X042c7a307;X0540bbac7;X05a2257af;X076ef87bc;X08595a2a3;X0db138e8f;X10854176c;X16bea4631;X1b3c3b854;X2694d51ab;X2958bacb7;X2a077f892;X2a86b68d1;X2b5aed85d;X2b70e1bf4;X2b937396e;X2d2a45fa9;X2fc74342f;X32e23c073;X348814447;X363bdecdc;X39dfe0f6d;X43596d05a;X43b856e53;X446078991;X463951182;X4701e30e8;X4af254af1;X4b81bbaad;X51b60ddb0;X52084d8a9;X52d5423c9;X57cc916d1;X5c8fa2b8c;X5e4272229;X6265fd4cf;X62bcd76aa;X6745ed1c4;X67b1432b7;X689a70788;X69386a4dd;X6d06ba9e3;X7111ff18d;X74a9116ee;X761f34f91;X76b2432b3;X780d6b5ef;X78dca00ea;X7bbea54ec;X7d3f03970;X8069f942f;X82690b573;X83ba6bb37;X8571ef23e;X87e271dfe;X89aa407df;X8a4a3b82f;X8a51f2878;X8aca6970d;X8cef3c050;X933c74132;X960bdb602;X961bb3d7a;X96f2e38b3;X9882636ec;X9917452c8;X992d786f6;X99a7d75d5;X9be368345;X9d0c16700;X9e13003e3;X9e68e9746;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa6122fbbd;Xa67f61b1c;Xa6bf33243;Xa7163075d;Xa7f194a1f;Xa82d2fd79;Xa9b7c7e18;Xac09d87c8;Xb0274f507;Xb0440a6cc;Xb05cd22b4;Xb41be8c35;Xb6a33544c;Xb71074f55;Xb7b920db6;Xb7e87b87f;Xb8615dcda;Xbd74722d2;Xbe4e39122;Xc0436ce7d;Xc195f7157;Xc70c83ab1;Xc918832ea;Xc951e17c2;Xcaf021bf2;Xcbbf5a9d7;Xcc3e03249;Xccd88aa61;Xcdf9ea239;Xce22640f8;Xcf17b9f95;Xcf6db41a0;Xd1409f631;Xd2f017497;Xd8fd092e3;Xdc7daa279;Xdec098283;Xe0823bc4b;Xe6f244d2d;Xec8e900fe;Xed66f6489;Xf0bd4504c;Xf1c4407a6;Xf1e2b76e4;Xfb4e80cbe;Xffe64f404,122,Alternative metrics in scientometrics: A meta-analysis of research into three altmetrics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.8010,2014
1319,"The article-level metrics (ALMs) or altmetrics becomes a new trendsetter in recent times for measuring the impact of scientific publications and their social outreach to intended audiences. The popular social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin and social bookmarks such as Mendeley and CiteULike are nowadays widely used for communicating research to larger transnational audiences. In 2012, the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment got signed by the scientific and researchers communities across the world. This declaration has given preference to the ALM or altmetrics over traditional but faulty journal impact factor (JIF)-based assessment of career scientists. JIF does not consider impact or influence beyond citations count as this count reflected only through Thomson Reuters' Web of Science database. Furthermore, JIF provides indicator related to the journal, but not related to a published paper. Thus, altmetrics now becomes an alternative metrics for performance assessment of individual scientists and their contributed scholarly publications. This paper provides a glimpse of genesis of altmetrics in measuring efficacy of scholarly communications and highlights available altmetric tools and social platforms linking altmetric tools, which are widely used in deriving altmetric scores of scholarly publications. The paper thus argues for institutions and policy makers to pay more attention to altmetrics based indicators for evaluation purpose but cautions that proper safeguards and validations are needed before their adoption.","Das, Anup Kumar;Mishra, Sanjaya",ArXiv e-prints,X04effcad4;X0e5f08279;X17d1fdbc6;X1b428b7a5;X2130cc650;X26fb04acd;X28361f390;X2c2f15afc;X2d4377f34;X359a43ca3;X3734bc5af;X37b41a565;X4958343b7;X4a5dc7de8;X4bfce82a7;X5891891ba;X5fa749aef;X60726ea76;X6180c0566;X61b16a5d9;X689bdf8d1;X69e140b5b;X6b59d2fc2;X6c74a1aa2;X6f846a40d;X740648463;X78380545d;X7afbab157;X7b0ee8ed0;X7cb69f359;X7d3f03970;X7f8fcb988;X859172c54;X8a2a8ad8a;X8bbc6b722;X8e3c5a937;X90a6a2324;X943354f8b;X9488a2fb3;X986ffe89f;X99b401f74;X9c46fdb05;X9d9435563;X9edd4f58e;Xa0a2ddec3;Xa1b994b71;Xa651fe34e;Xa7f194a1f;Xb09d5a31d;Xb0d66f1f3;Xb1bc3d49b;Xb36bf6d7a;Xbcb58a407;Xbecd88971;Xc0315a29d;Xc12a2e5fb;Xc29ab31e1;Xc45278a0a;Xc4ca32786;Xc77c67c72;Xca20dbb99;Xcdd852616;Xd1744ff34;Xd4a1c015b;Xd6066b8c1;Xd6459c4a2;Xd8369ba55;Xd9fe66e81;Xdcde44656;Xddf5e1bab;Xdf8444003;Xdfdf9b48e;Xe15cc9e63;Xe45da9a65;Xeabfd2a4a;Xec93776c4;Xefa158abf;Xf16159cd0;Xf2cbbd196;Xf41de0840;Xf5432f4da;Xf7a3b0744;Xfad101e8f;Xfbcf8e3b2;Xfc161e64c,85,Genesis of Altmetrics or Article-level Metrics for Measuring Efficacy of Scholarly Communications: Current Perspectives,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0090,2014
1320,"Correctly assessing a scientist's past research impact and potential for future impact is key in recruitment decisions and other evaluation processes. While a candidate's future impact is the main concern for these decisions, most measures only quantify the impact of previous work. Recently, it has been argued that linear regression models are capable of predicting a scientist's future impact. By applying that future impact model to 762 careers drawn from three disciplines: physics, biology, and mathematics, we identify a number of subtle, but critical, flaws in current models. Specifically, cumulative non-decreasing measures like the h-index contain intrinsic autocorrelation, resulting in significant overestimation of their ``predictive power''. Moreover, the predictive power of these models depend heavily upon scientists' career age, producing least accurate estimates for young researchers. Our results place in doubt the suitability of such models, and indicate further investigation is required before they can be used in recruiting decisions.","Penner, Orion;Pan, Raj K.;Petersen, Alexander M.;Kaski, Kimmo;Fortunato, Santo",Scientific Reports,X20aa1bb9e;X3a405ebe6;X57bd0c214;X6da386d76;X7d1ea5293;X8961fb9bc;Xa37ee4dcd;Xaf95f0a06;Xd5cd7d1f8;Xdae0cf787;Xe900aa7a2,11,On the Predictability of Future Impact in Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0114,2013

1324,"Citation networks represent the flow of information between agents. They are constrained in time and so form directed acyclic graphs which have a causal structure. Here we provide novel quantitative methods to characterise that structure by adapting methods used in the causal set approach to quantum gravity by considering the networks to be embedded in a Minkowski spacetime and measuring its dimension using Myrheim-Meyer and Midpoint-scaling estimates. We illustrate these methods on citation networks from the arXiv, supreme court judgements from the USA, and patents and find that otherwise similar citation networks have measurably different dimensions. We suggest that these differences can be interpreted in terms of the level of diversity or narrowness in citation behaviour.","Clough, James R.;Evans, Tim S.",ArXiv e-prints,X026881afd;X03e8d83ae;X03edbeb25;X05a2257af;X07873b163;X0b559beb5;X0f6fb051c;X19f9f1618;X1c7de130f;X1da5690df;X1e19adb65;X1f1425b8c;X20280c29f;X211384ae8;X2512d9f44;X276c59437;X2cd4c8737;X2d9931d3c;X2de0b6f44;X2ef7fe3d7;X2f66ba315;X2f89e2719;X3024823d8;X31495a9a8;X340a75759;X345e186e5;X3539442ec;X408191c8f;X437f25af1;X445f2ea8a;X4734faa92;X47414da64;X4a91583b9;X4bcbd1cd0;X4d0a5ad22;X4d38fd9b8;X4fd2b42c6;X52f090597;X53ee634f6;X55dac4f6b;X568b460d0;X571e3a56f;X593f8c8b1;X5970550e5;X5b8b512cf;X60925236c;X6235fae48;X6302a0ff6;X6491f229e;X67daabdec;X6e9e2fba0;X7125c788f;X71b4a308c;X71e058f71;X7b62a2647;X7e26c9893;X85bcd142e;X8829d45d1;X8a9e74d9b;X8c893c845;X90081ebcd;X9102f6beb;X92349879f;X933c74132;X9464abc42;Xa0b9fbd3a;Xa47c0f17a;Xab20fdf26;Xad3bdfcd9;Xaf95f0a06;Xb0c8ec2a2;Xb0cfeefb0;Xb427f0353;Xb4d3d9f8c;Xba90bc906;Xbbc66fadf;Xbca173a77;Xc21ec7def;Xc9ad2f1fd;Xca925e414;Xccd88aa61;Xcf11b9385;Xd06aa6f83;Xd1583986d;Xd63db0b73;Xd6ba84931;Xd970836ab;Xdb1b9ac21;Xdb30935b9;Xdccf9b140;Xde656614e;Xe1da15e79;Xe932886b3;Xea2d32768;Xec2831751;Xec8871843;Xee4025988;Xefc3fe2b2;Xf1daadd41;Xf21502872;Xf2e3bf216;Xf3b0950f2;Xf50724759;Xf59ad9566;Xf72d1ba04,105,What is the dimension of citation space?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1274,2014

In addition, their corresponding metadata and the software required to analyse or display them need to be archived. Yet the manual curation of research data can be difficult and expensive, particularly in very large digital repositories, hence the importance of models and tools for automating digital curation tasks. The automation of these tasks faces three major challenges: (1) research data and data sources are highly heterogeneous, (2) future research needs are difficult to anticipate, (3) data is hard to index. To address these problems, we propose the Extract, Transform and Archive (ETA) model for managing and mechanizing the curation of research data.

1327,"Data quality is commonly defined as fitness for use. The problem of identifying quality of data is faced by many data consumers. Data publishers often do not have the means to identify quality problems in their data. To make the task for both stakeholders easier, we have developed the Dataset Quality Ontology (daQ). daQ is a core vocabulary for representing the results of quality benchmarking of a linked dataset. It represents quality metadata as multi-dimensional and statistical observations using the Data Cube vocabulary. Quality metadata are organised as a self-contained graph, which can, e.g., be embedded into linked open datasets. We discuss the design considerations, give examples for extending daQ by custom quality metrics, and present use cases such as analysing data versions, browsing datasets by quality, and link identification.

Our final case study looks at whether reproducibility for one researcher is the same as for another, by having an author attempt to have others reproduce their own, reproducible, paper. This paper is open, executable and reproducible: the whole process of writing this paper is captured in the source control repository hosting both the source of the paper, supplementary codes and data; we are providing setup for several experiments on which we were working; finally, we try to describe what we have achieved during the week of the school in a way that others may reproduce (and hopefully improve) our experiments.","Arabas, Sylwester;Bareford, Michael R.;de Silva, Lakshitha R.;Gent, Ian P.;Gorman, Benjamin M.;Hajiarabderkani, Masih;Henderson, Tristan;Hutton, Luke;Konovalov, Alexander;Kotthoff, Lars;McCreesh, Ciaran;Nacenta, Miguel A.;Paul, Ruma R.;Petrie, Karen E.

1329,"We present the results of a comprehensive analysis of visualization paper keywords supplied for 4366 papers submitted to five main visualization conferences. We describe main keywords, topic areas, and 10-year historic trends from two datasets: (1) the standardized PCS taxonomy keywords in use for paper submissions for IEEE InfoVis, IEEE Vis-SciVis, IEEE VAST, EuroVis, and IEEE PacificVis since 2009 and (2) the author-chosen keywords for papers published in the IEEE Visualization conference series (now called IEEE VIS) since 2004. Our analysis of research topics in visualization can serve as a starting point to (a) help create a common vocabulary to improve communication among different visualization sub-groups, (b) facilitate the process of understanding differences and commonalities of the various research sub-fields in visualization, (c) provide an understanding of emerging new research trends, (d) facilitate the crucial step of finding the right reviewers for research submissions, and (e) it can eventually lead to a comprehensive taxonomy of visualization research. One additional tangible outcome of our work is an application that allows visualization researchers to easily browse the 2600+ keywords used for IEEE VIS papers during the past 10 years, aiming at more informed and, hence, more effective keyword selections for future visualization publications.","Isenberg, Petra;Isenberg, Tobias;Sedlmair, Michael;Chen, Jian;Möller, Torsten",ArXiv e-prints,X095886fe6;X0986f5a8e;X0b504e5da;X0bda73d33;X0e54384ce;X0e5f08279;X0ee7edd95;X16a24eed7;X1a487e9e6;X1bd085a23;X220ce80d5;X2db1b010b;X319e27862;X3d43ff4dc;X3fc60cb07;X41e38b341;X4c559f977;X4e822f8e7;X546c5946e;X54d56b44b;X63a46ed77;X654ce58a6;X659799cf4;X67fb23141;X6c2bf8c8a;X6d2a896bb;X7394d2ad8;X748cb0103;X7a2675e93;X7da51f54c;X839d09535;Xa1b994b71;Xa48933d2a;Xa4d3c3ac1;Xab43ae975;Xaba9f4aa8;Xacd792c6f;Xad57bc7e9;Xadb392374;Xafd392cda;Xb8696a530;Xbadf6241d;Xc00756dbb;Xc2fe0aa2a;Xc809c9dec;Xc86688f9b;Xcc479822e;Xdd834f35e;Xf215a7a14,49,Toward a deeper understanding of Visualization through keyword analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3297,2014

1331,"The distribution of the number of academic publications as a function of citation count for a given year is remarkably similar from year to year. We measure this similarity as a width of the distribution and find it to be approximately constant from year to year. We show that simple citation models fail to capture this behaviour. We then provide a simple three parameter citation network model using a mixture of local and global search processes which can reproduce the correct distribution over time. We use the citation network of papers from the hep-th section of arXiv to test our model. For this data, around 20% of citations use global information to reference recently published papers, while the remaining 80% are found using local searches. We note that this is consistent with other studies though our motivation is very different from previous work. Finally, we also find that the fluctuations in the size of an academic publication's bibliography is important for the model. This is not addressed in most models and needs further work.","Goldberg, S. R.;Anthony, H.;Evans, T.

1332,"Collaboration among researchers is an essential component of the modern scientific enterprise, playing a particularly important role in multidisciplinary research. However, we continue to wrestle with allocating credit to the coauthors of publications with multiple authors, since the relative contribution of each author is difficult to determine. At the same time, the scientific community runs an informal field-dependent credit allocation process that assigns credit in a collective fashion to each work. Here we develop a credit allocation algorithm that captures the coauthors' contribution to a publication as perceived by the scientific community, reproducing the informal collective credit allocation of science. We validate the method by identifying the authors of Nobel-winning papers that are credited for the discovery, independent of their positions in the author list. The method can also compare the relative impact of researchers working in the same field, even if they did not publish together. The ability to accurately measure the relative credit of researchers could affect many aspects of credit allocation in science, potentially impacting hiring, funding, and promotion decisions.","Shen, H. -W.;Barabasi, A. -L.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,X01677a62b;X129551863;X17df28bd3;X1d77863a2;X25c354da1;X2af4fd647;X343b18780;X3aacee174;X408bc509f;X411d1ee10;X456d16f4c;X50f8087ce;X5116bfac1;X58b29a73e;X5b7b186c5;X5c1696485;X6922c1e2c;X75e2d601f;X819f1d923;X8834b67ed;X88d0d01ee;X8fe74bda0;X98715b6eb;Xa927e9c6c;Xa98dc2b47;Xab0cd1eb0;Xaf88e4337;Xb5e79a86c;Xbaf561435;Xc4c0ad844;Xc4e40cc39;Xd3c724c41;Xd48fa6f57;Xd53cd6feb;Xd69b98c13;Xdad6086b8;Xfb62a6e93,37,Collective credit allocation in science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3455,2014
1333,"It is examined whether the number ($J$) of (joint) publications of a ""main scientist"" with her/his coauthors ranked according to rank ($r$) importance, i.e. $ J \propto 1/r $, as found by Ausloos [1] still holds for subfields, i.e. when the ""main scientist"" has worked on different, sometimes overlapping, subfields. Two cases are studied. It is shown that the law holds for large subfields. As shown, in an Appendix, is also useful to combine small topics into large ones for better statistics. It is observed that the sub-cores are much smaller than the overall coauthor core measure. Nevertheless, the smallness of the core and sub-cores may imply further considerations for the evaluation of team research purposes and activities.","Bougrine, Hassan",ArXiv e-prints,X15b817b30;X1b428b7a5;X3a0b664b9;X47719bde4;X4d35771cb;X9e74613ee;Xab4089532;Xba6b39ce3;Xfd53879fc,9,Subfield Effects on the Core of Coauthors,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0453,2013

1335,"The status of an actor in a social context is commonly defined in terms of two factors: the total number of endorsements the actor receives from other actors and the prestige of the endorsing actors. These two factors indicate the distinction between popularity and expert appreciation of the actor, respectively. We refer to the former as popularity and to the latter as prestige. These notions of popularity and prestige also apply to the domain of scholarly assessment. The ISI Impact Factor (ISI IF) is defined as the mean number of citations a journal receives over a 2 year period. By merely counting the amount of citations and disregarding the prestige of the citing journals, the ISI IF is a metric of popularity, not of prestige. We demonstrate how a weighted version of the popular PageRank algorithm can be used to obtain a metric that reflects prestige. We contrast the rankings of journals according to their ISI IF and their weighted PageRank, and we provide an analysis that reveals both significant overlaps and differences. Furthermore, we introduce the Y-factor which is a simple combination of both the ISI IF and the weighted PageRank, and find that the resulting journal rankings correspond well to a general understanding of journal status.","Bollen, Johan;Rodriguez, Marko A.;Van de Sompel, Herbert",ArXiv e-prints,54ec60d2ab;5526b679a7;X012409892;X01ab82bc0;X02b05013c;X05c0c7418;X077c05dbd;X07c20c0b2;X0a33398d3;X0c977492c;X0d9e7a81b;X0e7d1f693;X0ed17687b;X1126a82ad;X19afd7b91;X1a5bdc33e;X1ad960b84;X1d54a57b9;X2050c8cf2;X2059bb12e;X21f9e67e4;X226673b0d;X22b10581a;X22efd8cbf;X25b4fcb82;X260a59d54;X285956d7e;X28cbd566e;X2a2a0c8d0;X2abb24e41;X2c15b864c;X2ef8a4546;X3141702f5;X315cb814c;X34209ea78;X34edcfa64;X361a1d546;X3976560a2;X3afd2f966;X3c3534170;X3ef046c05;X4128908fd;X44981321b;X49c8db850;X4ab4840d3;X4c1b6d5d2;X4d7973b59;X4ea4c1a36;X5020057a9;X50fad68c4;X527d043c7;X54dbaa628;X56e41f382;X576db4eaa;X5d2f1264f;X5f21686cf;X5fd45b3bb;X630cf5211;X63b18899f;X65ed3c98b;X668758fba;X6863154de;X68d5c255e;X6910b34a1;X6974142b8;X6a55b03ff;X6f1242359;X6f821581d;X706fdeda8;X70df56475;X71a4002d7;X72249987d;X748d60ac7;X74c43a30b;X760d5d727;X79140986d;X81b64d8f5;X831430b99;X850aefa73;X866840c79;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X8af7261c5;X8b7a9b464;X8debb6584;X8fabeb86e;X90c5fe842;X90efcc0e6;X91026db67;X9587b1eae;X9666a1c36;X9a57bbd8a;X9c213a0ac;X9d1535c66;Xa0095a7c2;Xa1739463b;Xa1b0d45d5;Xa32504149;Xa33d94936;Xa405a56ec;Xa63fa0f36;Xa696164c0;Xa7ca7ab53;Xa89b42edd;Xaaafe889b;Xaf0d2d2fc;Xb1875d7bd;Xb56be6221;Xb678ecfd0;Xb7c125577;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xbbf460f65;Xbcfa6332f;Xc01375a25;Xc02512166;Xc11a3435c;Xc1913434c;Xc24b56c73;Xc570d5886;Xc6b99154e;Xc6c2527fc;Xc70681bc8;Xcd5664e50;Xd011d9c1b;Xd091e4732;Xd16bc7800;Xd179ed9f7;Xd2027c125;Xd28abc47f;Xd4be0a1a5;Xd89bbbcb4;Xdcbc0ac50;Xdd050c5cc;Xdd36f592e;Xde491956d;Xde50dbf05;Xdf5fcce37;Xe1f708de8;Xe2efb68cb;Xe5de1dc8f;Xeb46069de;Xed1f8c93a;Xeea907b37;Xef7bc08ae;Xf1d1b303f;Xf3b223276;Xf4188e5e0;Xf52efcf4f;Xf648bace5;Xf7f2ab644;Xf9a37d050,152,Journal Status,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0601030,2006
1336,"The Information Flow Framework (IFF) is a descriptive category metatheory. It is an experiment in foundations, which follows a bottom-up approach to logical description. The IFF forms the structural aspect of the IEEE P1600.1 Standard Upper Ontology (SUO) project. The categorical approach of the IFF provides a principled framework for the modular design of object-level ontologies. The IFF represents meta-logic, and as such operates at the structural level of ontologies. In the IFF, there is a precise boundary between the metalevel and the object level. The modular architecture of the IFF consists of metalevels, namespaces and meta-ontologies. Each metalevel services the levels below by providing a metalanguage used to declare and axiomatize those levels. Corresponding to the metalevels are nested metalanguages, where each metalanguage axiomatization includes specialization of the one immediately above. Within each metalevel, the terminology is partitioned into namespaces, and various namespaces are collected together into meaningful composites called meta-ontologies. All of the various meta-ontologies in the IFF are anchored to the IFF metastack. The IFF development is largely driven by the principles of conceptual warrant, categorical design and institutional logic.","Kent, Robert E.",ArXiv e-prints,X1726eb6c4;X45020d1ff;X94034252b;X9e4fb1ac1;Xa90707992;Xb4bd488ba;Xc34f701ae;Xe481960da;Xfeab0f9a7,9,The Information Flow Framework: A Descriptive Category Metatheory,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4133,2011

Our results show clearly that the presented search term, journal name and author name recommendations are highly relevant to the researchers' topic and can easily be integrated for search in Digital Libraries. The average precision for top ranked recommendations is 0.75 for author names, 0.74 for search terms and 0.73 for journal names. The relevance distribution differs largely across topics and researcher types.

1339,"Although various visual interfaces for digital libraries have been developed in prototypical systems, very few of these visual approaches have been integrated into today's digital libraries.

We feel that the comparability of evaluation results could be improved by building a common evaluation setup consisting of a reference system, based on a standardized corpus with fixed tasks and a panel for possible participants.","van Hoek, Wilko;Mayr, Philipp",ArXiv e-prints,X03bb3fc91;X04925118c;X06ea06f8a;X13ebeacc6;X150815784;X29e2c309d;X381a1111a;X4008ec009;X41926b01f;X41a4ff33b;X428beab3d;X4694bfc68;X46d1cb59d;X4e5254a4f;X4ed40f180;X5268d9474;X57f236ee2;X5af1ff7a9;X5d5afa4cb;X61165e96a;X61bbec9b5;X6248a5e8d;X62f8706f2;X6350d8543;X6567f45d8;X68e2f0718;X6be535cf2;X6be837466;X6f050b58a;X725b00cc5;X7e8f960d3;X7fd94817e;X848f092df;X863b550e2;X8ea7c86c0;X91880612f;X9349ce06e;X96d4ee4e4;X9785d21f0;X97cb31fbb;Xa1b994b71;Xa4b46c183;Xa6158e0f9;Xa8f72af54;Xac7c4a16e;Xaf65a4466;Xb23a782a0;Xb833eb0b5;Xbe36ff108;Xc2739bafa;Xc62c71ae8;Xc9678b086;Xcceacc76c;Xcfb4c8606;Xd98ebb060;Xdaa379b21;Xdb350f703;Xdbab9b72e;Xdf6bb162b;Xe2c24b441;Xe5ca3c819;Xe81694760;Xf226fcc90;Xfe0c4c1af;Xfe921d90f,65,Is Evaluating Visual Search Interfaces in Digital Libraries Still an Issue?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5001,2014
1340,"Recently, Thomson Reuters has published its 2014 list of highly cited researchers (HCRs)[1]. Initial studies over the list [2] suggested that some universities (for instance, King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia) may have been manipulating its world ranking by contracting with highly cited researchers. In this work, we analyse the ranking of other Saudi universities based solely on the list. Our analysis suggests that other universities in Saudi Arabia do not follow the steps of King Abdulaziz University when it comes to contracting with HCRs.","Alanazi, Eisa",ArXiv e-prints,X0377460c6;X88a1b01cf;Xad2e7c7b6;Xb2009187a;Xf81fc0084,5,A Note on the Ranking of Saudi Arabian Universities based on highlycited.com,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6438,2014

1342,"It is well known in bibliometrics that the average number of citations per paper differs greatly between the various disciplines. The differing citation culture (in particular the different average number of references per paper and thereby the different probability of being cited) is widely seen as the cause of this variation. Based on all Web of Science (WoS) records published in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 we demonstrate that almost all disciplines show similar numbers of references in the appendices of their papers. Our results suggest that the average citation rate is far more influenced by the extent to which the papers (cited as references) are included in WoS as linked database records. For example, the comparatively low citation rates in the humanities are not at all the result of a lower average number of references per paper but are caused by the low fraction of linked references which refer to papers published in the core journals covered by WoS.","Marx, Werner;Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,54ecbdd48a;X03165d3b8;X048299ba0;X0954e8445;X18a3cc441;X1dfbf6565;X21c60383c;X2701bba87;X2bcf9d438;X2c65c77c2;X3539442ec;X367d0cda0;X3d3e246b7;X455fd7d64;X46c39dcee;X4fc7fbbc0;X50f20ad84;X520e51378;X5572e1288;X58f2f3c4a;X5cacc23cf;X5cf3075f7;X5ef21b411;X6b3f25189;X73c0dcf88;X74d613028;X7bece2dca;X82e1a0516;X8f301427d;X96f2e38b3;X97ccd95ea;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa636bf8f0;Xb322ec66f;Xb537e6549;Xb94560db2;Xbd71bb8eb;Xbe4e39122;Xc1b8505e3;Xc52682f2f;Xc6b8fa295;Xcbbf5a9d7;Xd8e826b98;Xd972632d3;Xf4863f28f;Xf4f646e79,48,On the causes of subject-specific citation rates in Web of Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5893,2014
1343,"Master's Degree Thesis: Department of Physics, University of Turin Supervisor: Prof. Marco Maggiora, Department of Physics, University of Turin; email: marco.maggiora@unito.it Co-Supervisor: Prof. Walter Allasia, Innovation Department, EURIX; email: allasia@eurix.it The thesis describes an agent-based model aimed to simulate those processes in which a digital object faces the risk of obsolescence, a migration process has to be performed and the most appropriate file format has to be adopted. Agents have been designed in order to monitor and control the local system where they reside and its environment. They are able to become aware of obsolescent formats based on global parameters such as their diffusion. They communicate as well with each other to find out the most suitable preservation action to be performed. Agents request suggestions that are evaluated and propagated according to a weighting based on the level of trust assigned to both the agents who identified the problem and proposed the solution. In the current research, the definition of the trust level has been chosen based on the cultural and geographical distances, the expertise of the involved agents and the file format numerosity. The level of trust between two agents is automatically updated after every interaction by the mean of a feedback mechanism profiting of an inter agent communication based on stigmergy. Summing up, the thesis demonstrates how a multi-agent system can either perform an autonomous preservation action or suggest a list of best candidate solutions to the user. It benefits the management of several kinds of digital archive, especially those with limited resources specifically dedicated to digital preservation, such as small personal collections and many public institutions.","Pellegrino, Jacopo",ArXiv e-prints,X08aa8cafd;X0e5c02f87;X133afb955;X147d0ecce;X14cb6d540;X15ec3cfd0;X1624d6f81;X1faaabe65;X2184e3e88;X21e29ebad;X269e71774;X28fc5b5ae;X2b59d1b72;X2b8081b91;X32bce9333;X32c891790;X38190f7e2;X3b276a18c;X3d3d0c4f1;X3db3543be;X3fed61a9e;X420080feb;X43c76531c;X4f5322f81;X55ddfce63;X585c39884;X5b5784f9d;X5c12c5dab;X65b7321fe;X66a4a9fcf;X67af3b894;X683b46fb1;X6c61155d4;X7102cc172;X7447a26d0;X78bb197fd;X7ac56b411;X7bac63265;X809980122;X80be95f1c;X832c34b59;X864815478;X88709b458;X8b70f4ef9;X927de8e9d;X94c73583f;X98ec43bbd;X9e1b29f5c;X9e8a50026;X9f87cd28c;Xa0d1d53be;Xa1f0d9062;Xa5fd66628;Xa7226342f;Xa8eb32b4a;Xa96de17aa;Xaa36c8db1;Xad1c58da1;Xb5edf242b;Xb814f5e3d;Xb8c0ebc1e;Xbdf5765de;Xcac4005a9;Xcd5fcb4b7;Xce8cc73d6;Xcfe094459;Xd027c4a8e;Xd1de68e49;Xd2a1d9624;Xd3d975fc4;Xd40f567db;Xdb350f703;Xdeaee52e1;Xe83147a52;Xf51099487;Xfaaf8bf94;Xfe6e5c267;Xfee289314,78,A Multi-agent Based Digital Preservation Model,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6126,2014

By identifying all unique words and phrases and determining their monthly usage patterns, we obtain quantifiable insights into the trends of physics discovery from the end of the 19th century to today. We show that the magnitudes of upward and downward trends yield heavy-tailed distributions, and that their emergence is due to the Matthew effect. This indicates that both the rise and fall of scientific paradigms is driven by robust principles of self-organization.

1348,"Over the last few years, several major scientific fraud cases have shocked the scientific community. The number of retractions each year has also increased tremendously, especially in the biomedical field, and scientific misconduct accounts for approximately more than half of those retractions. It is assumed that co-authors of retracted papers are affected by their colleagues' misconduct, and the aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence of the effect of retractions in biomedical research on co-authors' research careers. Using data from the Web of Science (WOS), we measured the productivity, impact and collaboration of 1,123 co-authors of 293 retracted articles for a period of five years before and after the retraction. We found clear evidence that collaborators do suffer consequences of their colleagues' misconduct, and that a retraction for fraud has higher consequences than a retraction for error. Our results also suggest that the extent of these consequences is closely linked with the ranking of co-authors on the retracted paper, being felt most strongly by first authors, followed by the last authors, while the impact is less important for middle authors.","Mongeon, Philippe;Lariviere, Vincent",ArXiv e-prints,X007952da4;X06ddb436d;X07a2c15ee;X082b73684;X09a62a470;X10b4fb8c1;X10ddc2ae7;X15c856862;X20991c5a6;X2a372ecb0;X30619830e;X3359ad239;X33fb38f97;X3b7becbf4;X3c6508cc7;X433d3394a;X45ea3975b;X51df83582;X5a163dc1f;X5b0d1f92e;X5b74d5c3e;X6104abc5f;X62f303afd;X67203f997;X6b092c55c;X7115fae5f;X76d876681;X7c858b44e;X80a38f2fe;X8d9a1e959;X95d251ed9;X98889c550;Xa1b994b71;Xa31658963;Xa71c5c8ab;Xa78ed0592;Xaec8580cf;Xb0048a737;Xb8393f88b;Xbc5153a52;Xbdb759e3f;Xbe88fb5b3;Xc332f627f;Xc67f6a749;Xc90cde997;Xcc0919b2c;Xd4124babb;Xd6038d0cb;Xd98cf3bc4;Xe42a4f665;Xf6b9f09f5,51,Costly Collaborations: The Impact of Scientific Fraud on Co-authors' Careers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0129,2014
1349,"In this paper, we analyze the adequacy and applicability of readership statistics recorded in social reference management systems for creating knowledge domain visualizations. First, we investigate the distribution of subject areas in user libraries of educational technology researchers on Mendeley. The results show that around 69% of the publications in an average user library can be attributed to a single subject area. Then, we use co-readership patterns to map the field of educational technology. The resulting visualization prototype, based on the most read publications in this field on Mendeley, reveals 13 topic areas of educational technology research. The visualization is a recent representation of the field: 80% of the publications included were published within ten years of data collection. The characteristics of the readers, however, introduce certain biases to the visualization. Knowledge domain visualizations based on readership statistics are therefore multifaceted and timely, but it is important that the characteristics of the underlying sample are made transparent.","Kraker, Peter;Schlögl, Christian;Jack, Kris;Lindstaedt, Stefanie",ArXiv e-prints,553220b339;X0162ceb75;X08537be94;X085cd692a;X0954e8445;X0bff44c05;X10397b230;X10c833095;X136a0b934;X13e356578;X141ebba71;X15f9a54ae;X16bea4631;X1eb917181;X208dc404e;X23b88ea94;X2cb99fc09;X2f15d4a4c;X33c676405;X384daf670;X3b41c8d96;X3ead65e0d;X3f12ea6e5;X479df81f5;X4aca07190;X4f5a262a8;X537a32e4a;X546c5946e;X5b7b186c5;X5c8fa2b8c;X659799cf4;X67a531590;X6a7e8a2ea;X6c6fa06f9;X6fbd01505;X7188a8017;X75f397c57;X785816b7e;X78ccf6572;X7c5a1081d;X7d3f03970;X7d5117b0f;X7d9132cbb;X82d26ae85;X84a92dce2;X8823ba3a2;X8c3a2176a;X94ba7afb2;X94d96f35a;X9749cb0b8;X97e7fe2d5;X9953604f9;X998b7b10f;X9b561c4f2;X9c6fc8b13;X9ed0ee6c0;Xa1965c29a;Xa1b994b71;Xa20d5f7cd;Xa37748b0d;Xa4f21cdd4;Xa628da88e;Xa659a8bc4;Xa6bf33243;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xaebebe062;Xb54c46328;Xbd74722d2;Xbd7d5b88b;Xbdba93d59;Xc13c8c206;Xc1644eecb;Xc6b8fa295;Xc6c1553a6;Xc6e0691ee;Xc953a58d2;Xcab667061;Xcb8b4991f;Xceb0d1643;Xd1abe56a7;Xd2aee4a34;Xd6f93799d;Xd9c20c332;Xdd16383f6;Xdfcd4ec46;Xe194bc584;Xe51e869bc;Xed0e43df5;Xf073ee54a;Xf0a24eb62;Xf2517d8a2;Xf313e211b;Xf46a0a49b;Xf52efcf4f;Xf8fb72f9d;Xfa63049f9,96,Visualization of Co-Readership Patterns from an Online Reference Management System,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0348,2014
1350,"The general pupose of the scholarly communication process is to support the creation and dissemination of ideas within the scientific community. At a finer granularity, there exists multiple stages which, when confronted by a member of the community, have different requirements and therefore different solutions. In order to take a researcher's idea from an initial inspiration to a community resource, the scholarly communication infrastructure may be required to 1) provide a scientist initial seed ideas; 2) form a team of well suited collaborators; 3) located the most appropriate venue to publish the formalized idea; 4) determine the most appropriate peers to review the manuscript; and 5) disseminate the end product to the most interested members of the community. Through the various delinieations of this process, the requirements of each stage are tied soley to the multi-functional resources of the community: its researchers, its journals, and its manuscritps. It is within the collection of these resources and their inherent relationships that the solutions to scholarly communication are to be found.

1352,"We propose an approach to index raster images of dictionary pages which in turn would require very little manual effort to enable direct access to the appropriate pages of the dictionary for lookup. Accessibility is further improved by feedback and crowdsourcing that enables highlighting of the specific location on the page where the lookup word is found, annotation, digitization, and fielded searching. This approach is equally applicable on simple scripts as well as complex writing systems. Using our proposed approach, we have built a Web application called ""Dictionary Explorer"" which supports word indexes in various languages and every language can have multiple dictionaries associated with it. Word lookup gives direct access to appropriate pages of all the dictionaries of that language simultaneously. The application has exploration features like searching, pagination, and navigating the word index through a tree-like interface. The application also supports feedback, annotation, and digitization features. Apart from the scanned images, ""Dictionary Explorer"" aggregates results from various sources and user contributions in Unicode. We have evaluated the time required for indexing dictionaries of different sizes and complexities in the Urdu language and examined various trade-offs in our implementation. Using our approach, a single person can make a dictionary of 1,000 pages searchable in less than an hour.","Alam, Sawood;Mehmood, Fateh ud din B;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X39afe5370;X433b980dc;X4a0c919d6;X4b3f22e15;X667fa455b;X7fbb6c2fd;X8850fca4a;X938699a83;Xa7e66ec3d;Xbb0d016cf;Xbd5b0203d;Xbeea2be55;Xd208d603e;Xf3bc1fa73,14,Improving Accessibility of Archived Raster Dictionaries of Complex Script Languages,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1284,2014

1354,"Individual, excellent scientists have become increasingly important in the research funding landscape. Accurate bibliometric measures of an individual's performance could help identify excellent scientists, but still present a challenge. One crucial aspect in this respect is an adequate delineation of the sets of publications that determine the reference values to which a scientist's publication record and its citation impact should be compared. The structure of partition cells formed by intersecting fixed subject categories in a database has been proposed to approximate a scientist's specialty more closely than can be done with the broader subject categories. This paper investigates this cell structure's suitability as an underlying basis for methodologies to assess individual scientists, from two perspectives: (1) Proximity to the actual structure of publication records of individual scientists: The distribution and concentration of publications over the highly fragmented structure of partition cells are examined for a sample of ERC grantees; (2) Proximity to customary levels of accuracy: Differences in commonly used reference values (mean expected number of citations per publication, and threshold number of citations for highly cited publications) between adjacent partition cells are compared to differences in two other dimensions: successive publication years and successive citation window lengths. Findings from both perspectives are in support of partition cells rather than the larger subject categories as a journal based structure on which to construct and apply methodologies for the assessment of highly specialized publication records such as those of individual scientists.","Rons, Nadine",ArXiv e-prints,X9c8e43f43;Xac3115cee;Xc5291d307;Xc59eafc7c;Xc92f9644e,5,Investigation of Partition Cells as a Structural Basis Suitable for Assessments of Individual Scientists,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2365,2014
1355,"Mapping Science across countries is a challenging task in the field of Scientometrics. A number of efforts trying to cope with this task has been discussed in the state of the art, addressing this challenge by processing collections of scientific digital libraries and visualizing author-based measures (for instance, the h-index) or document-based measures (for instance, the averaged number of citations per document). A major drawback of these approaches is related to the presence of bias. The bigger the country, the higher the measure value. We explore the use of an econometric index to tackle this limitation, known as the Revealed Comparative Advantage measure (RCA). Using RCA, the diversity and ubiquity of each field of knowledge is mapped across countries. Then, a RCA-based proximity function is explored to visualize citation and h-index ubiquity. Science maps relating 27 knowledge areas and 237 countries are introduced using data crawled from Scimago that ranges from 1996 to 2011. Our results shows that the proposal is feasible and can be extended to ellaborate a global scientific production characterization.","Guevara, Miguel;Mendoza, Marcelo",ArXiv e-prints,X27ffd78af;X36d51618e;X41fe28b17;Xa1b994b71;Xa654ebc3f;Xcf32d617f;Xe13191ea1;Xfe3a6271a,8,Revealing Comparative Advantages in the Backbone of Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1911,2014
1356,"Purpose: Whereas citation counts allow the measurement of the impact of research on research itself, an important role in the measurement of the impact of research on other parts of society is ascribed to altmetrics. The present case study investigates the usefulness of altmetrics for measuring the broader impact of research. Methods: This case study is essentially based on a dataset with papers obtained from F1000. The dataset was augmented with altmetrics (such as Twitter counts) which were provided by PLOS (the Public Library of Science). In total, the case study covers a total of 1,082 papers. Findings: The F1000 dataset contains tags on papers which were assigned intellectually by experts and which can characterise a paper. The most interesting tag for altmetric research is ""good for teaching"". This tag is assigned to papers which could be of interest to a wider circle of readers than the peers in a specialist area. Particularly on Facebook and Twitter, one could expect papers with this tag to be mentioned more often than those without this tag. With respect to the ""good for teaching"" tag, the results from regression models were able to confirm these expectations: Papers with this tag show significantly higher Facebook and Twitter counts than papers without this tag. This association could not be seen with Mendeley or Figshare counts (that is with counts from platforms which are chiefly of interest in a scientific context). Conclusions: The results of the current study indicate that Facebook and Twitter, but not Figshare or Mendeley, can provide indications of papers which are of interest to a broader circle of readers (and not only for the peers in a specialist area), and seem therefore be useful for societal impact measurement.","Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X000789272;X00bd80b2c;X05a8a5d10;X0a1dbf5d0;X17e8709d7;X19ac28571;X1bc576eff;X1cceb2dce;X24a340d31;X2a077f892;X2eafdfc51;X2f909457b;X31f8fedc6;X442dfc6fc;X4513acc6e;X4c2483cc9;X521e0d636;X694199369;X6d8639bce;X7159cfbb8;X7b83eded2;X7d3f03970;X7f4aef04f;X82690b573;X8571ef23e;X8c45cf0fd;X9a0a0345a;X9d91a0fde;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa651fe34e;Xa7f194a1f;Xbe4e39122;Xc45278a0a;Xc8cc80ba1;Xd1e04234a;Xda45862b8;Xdb2c3b1c7;Xdd7d98333;Xdec3a2817;Xec8e900fe;Xf6ae2116e;Xfce956cbf;Xffe64f404,44,Usefulness of altmetrics for measuring the broader impact of research: A case study using data from PLOS (altmetrics) and F1000Prime (paper tags),http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2863,2014

1358,"Publication patterns of 79 forest scientists awarded major international forestry prizes during 1990-2010 were compared with the journal classification and ranking promoted as part of the 'Excellence in Research for Australia' (ERA) by the Australian Research Council. The data revealed that these scientists exhibited an elite publication performance during the decade before and two decades following their first major award. An analysis of their 1703 articles in 431 journals revealed substantial differences between the journal choices of these elite scientists and the ERA classification and ranking of journals. Implications from these findings are that additional cross-classifications should be added for many journals, and there should be an adjustment to the ranking of several journals relevant to the ERA Field of Research classified as 0705 Forestry Sciences.","Vanclay, Jerome K",ArXiv e-prints,X1e26293e3;X3a977220c;X555283037;X5803a0494;X587a04fc0;X8d86f3ff9;Xa5ed1213f;Xb162e706b;Xe3801d073;Xf957f7d00,10,Publication patterns of award-winning forest scientists and implications for the ERA journal ranking,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4828,2011
1359,"There is a widespread perception that pharmaceutical R&D is facing a productivity crisis characterised by stagnation in the numbers of new drug approvals in the face of increasing R&D costs. This study explores pharmaceutical R&D dynamics by examining the publication activities of all R&D laboratories of the major European and US pharmaceutical firms during the period 1995-2009. The empirical findings present an industry in transformation.In the first place, we observe a decline of the total number of publications by large firms. Second, we show a relative increase of their external collaborations suggesting a tendency to outsource, and a diversification of the disciplinary base, in particular towards computation, health services and more clinical approaches. Also evident is a more pronounced decline in publications by both R&D laboratories located in Europe and by firms with European headquarters. Finally, while publications by Big Pharma in emerging economies sharply increase, they remain extremely low compared with those in developed countries. In summary, the trend in this transformation is one of a gradual decrease in internal research efforts and increasing reliance on external research. These empirical insights support the view that large pharmaceutical firms are increasingly becoming networks integrators rather than the prime locus of drug discovery.","Rafols, Ismael;Hopkins, Michael M.;Hoekman, Jarno;Siepel, Josh;O'Hare, Alice;Perianes-Rodriguez, Antonio;Nightingale, Paul",ArXiv e-prints,X04e97d978;X05cd3f36d;X0bcd2b553;X12a8539b1;X15a5fcc9a;X197cbf678;X22473cbb7;X250ae5510;X250ffa4c9;X27c4e4ab3;X387b4e3ed;X40592e5de;X470147fe1;X477fc24dc;X47b8b5791;X4b624bf58;X51f48dad8;X586bb004d;X590a5c3cd;X5f62b9fb6;X5f6fb2a3d;X6059f0f47;X67af3b894;X6f69a5722;X75ee09cdb;X772015bf3;X7dc939fde;X81ef6d485;X83011e033;X8689798c0;X89ea417a0;X910402ea0;X96b8f9e18;X99713ed2f;X99d403387;X9c1a2a93f;X9dc887490;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa433e5035;Xa51cf96e2;Xa6bf33243;Xa96b95a08;Xab2f5e597;Xaf57fe56c;Xb5daebc4b;Xb8ee739a5;Xb950039aa;Xbb354c0e3;Xbe8e6f768;Xc00210152;Xc0eea39f8;Xc88e38a15;Xcd14ee71a;Xcd332e971;Xd5a5208f6;Xd96bcc39c;Xe08222353;Xe1b8539c0;Xe2dd6af04;Xe3222edd4;Xe3e96819f;Xe67eefb22;Xe69ce0bba;Xe976abb6d;Xebfdbb585;Xf04712acd;Xf4618da0b;Xfad73060c;Xfbdd46241;Xfdfc6c97e,71,"Big Pharma, little science?

Social attention is the important source that bringing network traffic to browser html view and may lead to citation subsequently. High altmetric score has the potential role in promoting the long-term academic impact of articles, when a conceptual model is proposed to interpret the conversion from social attention to article view, and to citation finally.","Wang, Xianwen;Liu, Chen;Fang, Zhichao;Mao, Wenli",ArXiv e-prints,X0954e8445;X0b8209458;X148b14e3f;X1900fcf91;X1e8614d92;X1f57e75e6;X25bd6525e;X26a3dba5b;X30cd2689b;X359211a5f;X35f3a35d3;X40ab0ffe4;X4874ee2df;X4e3d30eb5;X594c7a5a5;X59b88f787;X637a65184;X73bf7f06f;X7d3f03970;X81ebfcd65;X89557e215;X978787ad5;X97b973913;X9a89494db;X9e8ea3448;Xa0c14245d;Xa1b994b71;Xa65a4123e;Xa8f8ba34c;Xb486ce2aa;Xbddc376a8;Xbe4e39122;Xcbbd11961;Xcccb01ddc;Xcddea854a;Xda6c6b095;Xf33d97589;Xf554688b6;Xfad3799ce;Xfba2e587e,40,"From Attention to Citation, What and How Does Altmetrics Work?",http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4269,2014
1363,"Over three years ago, the Core Integration team of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) implemented a digital library based on metadata aggregation using Dublin Core and OAI-PMH. The initial expectation was that such low-barrier technologies would be relatively easy to automate and administer. While this architectural choice permitted rapid deployment of a production NSDL, our three years of experience have contradicted our original expectations of easy automation and low people cost. We have learned that alleged ""low-barrier"" standards are often harder to deploy than expected. In this paper we report on this experience and comment on the general cost, the functionality, and the ultimate effectiveness of this architecture.","Lagoze, Carl;Krafft, Dean;Cornwell, Tim;Dushay, Naomi;Eckstrom, Dean;Saylor, John",ArXiv e-prints,X004a6eb1f;X095412f9c;X12192ea86;X13caf0d09;X143e3397d;X1682af07d;X1699ca94f;X1f334322f;X2717274f4;X2cc4da5a2;X357b6325c;X37cae07db;X3b034f9fe;X3d52557e6;X3de9f03a4;X476e95b8d;X4c8d9d60c;X4f0cda26c;X4fcd84c7f;X512d5ed5a;X5622e72aa;X5e8ea4235;X61eaa024a;X716d7c445;X7188d47e7;X73344b03c;X733e28420;X7793f5670;X7eeaca8f0;X801b5d610;X8257eded1;X8e3dce6b0;X91ff520c9;X96b429fac;X970fd137b;X9b91180d5;X9c1e0e717;Xa181946bd;Xa5e179e3c;Xa86b53cb5;Xb1a306cb2;Xba43cbae9;Xc0975f32d;Xc0b40822b;Xc5f078a01;Xce17c186a;Xce8069b35;Xd3f4c6447;Xd47d987c2;Xd552c2a24;Xe7b1d413d;Xe83f10108;Xf6e36ef1d;Xf72d3d5fd;Xf7461dcf4;Xf79ecb1f8;Xf90501ec1;Xfd2568bd4;Xfd436dac9;Xfe9323d2c;Xffef3cf44,61,"Metadata aggregation and ""automated digital libraries"": A retrospective on the NSDL experience",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0601125,2006

1366,"We use citation data of scientific articles produced by individual nations in different scientific domains to determine the structure and efficiency of national research systems. We characterize the scientific fitness of each nation (that is, the competitiveness of its research system) and the complexity of each scientific domain by means of a non-linear iterative algorithm able to assess quantitatively the advantage of scientific diversification. We find that technological leading nations, beyond having the largest production of scientific papers and the largest number of citations, do not specialize in a few scientific domains. Rather, they diversify as much as possible their research system. On the other side, less developed nations are competitive only in scientific domains where also many other nations are present. Diversification thus represents the key element that correlates with scientific and technological competitiveness. A remarkable implication of this structure of the scientific competition is that the scientific domains playing the role of ""markers"" of national scientific competitiveness are those not necessarily of high technological requirements, but rather addressing the most ""sophisticated"" needs of the society.","Cimini, Giulio;Gabrielli, Andrea;Sylos Labini, Francesco",PLoS ONE,4690995014;54b643f364;54ef96b431;X0d2500f23;X10b0b1669;X117932b6f;X16b95876d;X181f8ea34;X1aee73b97;X4056e4f4e;X45877e8c1;X50f8087ce;X55ea372bf;X594c7a5a5;X66d572f44;X67af3b894;X6a3926750;X6c173a8c6;X6defbe74e;X71bb2b949;X749501c78;X8882c011c;X88fbf066b;X8ab39b091;X8e3ae7e32;X8f2141c7e;X908e7b848;X945d5fcbd;X99d3bfd3b;X9e1306928;Xa00972b9b;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa46f4b4c4;Xa87302ca2;Xb9465b58e;Xbc0bb839a;Xbf4779752;Xc25c442d8;Xcbbf5a9d7;Xef41eef2d,40,The Scientific Competitiveness of Nations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5698,2014
1367,"The concept of h-index has been proposed to easily assess a researcher's performance with a single number. However, by using only this number, we lose significant information about the distribution of citations per article in an author's publication list. In this article, we study an author's citation curve and we define two new areas related to this curve. We call these ""penalty areas"", since the greater they are, the more an author's performance is penalized. We exploit these areas to establish new indices, namely PI and XPI, aiming at categorizing researchers in two distinct categories: ""influentials"" and ""mass producers""; the former category produces articles which are (almost all) with high impact, and the latter category produces a lot of articles with moderate or no impact at all. Using data from Microsoft Academic Service, we evaluate the merits mainly of PI as a useful tool for scientometric studies. We establish its effectiveness into separating the scientists into influentials and mass producers; we demonstrate its robustness against self-citations, and its uncorrelation to traditional indices. Finally, we apply PI to rank prominent scientists in the areas of databases, networks and multimedia, exhibiting the strength of the index in fulfilling its design goal.","Sidiropoulos, Antonis;Katsaros, Dimitrios;Manolopoulos, Yannis",ArXiv e-prints,509ac2f300;X07ff17e9a;X0efb78f25;X178acc0e6;X26dfc0eac;X3dd81c0a8;X408bc509f;X40f925368;X4af309cf2;X4ca93cd28;X4f5a262a8;X56b019d11;X573bdceef;X5a750e5fd;X5c06fe5f1;X5c1696485;X5d21e31d8;X63f52d9d9;X6922c1e2c;X72e2f2c0b;X909218376;X98715b6eb;X993ec2c90;Xa11e4fd32;Xa1b994b71;Xa927e9c6c;Xab0cd1eb0;Xabfc97ee0;Xb41135e5f;Xc13a36fec;Xc4e40cc39;Xd48fa6f57;Xd8ebed805;Xd97b3bf74;Xdad6086b8;Xe0a324317;Xeb55a3628;Xed0e43df5;Xfb62a6e93,39,Identification of Influential Scientists vs. Mass Producers by the Perfectionism Index,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6099,2014

It shows that PhD students contribute to about a third of the publication output of the province, with doctoral students in the natural and medical sciences being present in a higher proportion of papers published than their colleagues of the social sciences and humanities. Collaboration is an important component of this socialization: disciplines in which student collaboration is higher are also those in which doctoral students are the most involved in peer-reviewed publications.

About 18% have an especially high degree of attractiveness over and above what is typical for the journal. One can also classify the ageing of attractiveness by examining download half-lives. Approximately 18% have strong interest initially, waning in time. A further 20% exhibit “delayed recognition” with relatively late spurs in download activity.

Here we study the distributions of citations to publications from individual academic institutions for a single year. The average number of citations have large variations between different institutions across the world, but the probability distributions of citations for individual institutions can be rescaled to a common form by scaling the citations by the average number of citations for that institution. We find this feature to be universal for a broad selection of institutions irrespective of the average number of citations per article. A similar analysis for citations to publications in a particular journal in a single year reveals that there are at least two distinct classes of journals across disciplines, depending on the form of the distribution function.

Science is also affected by this governmental interest in impact; the issue is not only the impact of research on research itself, but on other areas of society. Citations are traditionally used to measure the impact of research on research. It is as yet unclear how the impact of research on other areas of society can be measured. It appears that alternative metrics (altmetrics, such as Twitter counts) might play a key role in this. This paper is concerned with the measurement of citation impact and societal impact, and looks at the basis, the effects and the problems of impact measurement.","Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X00a5b8ee6;X00c65ba43;X0855cc451;X09a018eb4;X0bb577a13;X113f3ee08;X1875cc378;X1cceb2dce;X1e3a4b068;X208371f1f;X25eb9a659;X28d2a2065;X30cd2689b;X35ca37ff7;X49ea5883a;X53daf67b1;X5a01781c7;X5c8fa2b8c;X694199369;X698543ddf;X6c5a33126;X6c74a1aa2;X7d3f03970;X907eafd3c;X960bdb602;X96f2e38b3;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa24262ed1;Xa6ad65037;Xb0b6151d7;Xb243c63e7;Xb3dbeae37;Xb430116fc;Xbd3704761;Xbe4e39122;Xbeb5d1fb4;Xc2fd1b09e;Xd643bdd61;Xd90a7ecd3;Xdc2dbe278;Xdec3a2817;Xe5518ec13;Xe6f244d2d;Xe85c6cb6a;Xea9e5d737;Xed54abb40;Xfb246f4bf,48,Measuring impact in research evaluations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1895,2014
1379,"In this paper, we use bibliometric methods and social network analysis to analyze the pattern of China-US scientific collaboration on individual level in nanotechnology. Results show that Chinese-American scientists have been playing an important role in China-US scientific collaboration. We find that China-US collaboration in nanotechnology mainly occurs between Chinese and Chinese-American scientists. In the co-authorship network, Chinese-American scientists tend to have higher betweenness centrality. Moreover, the series of polices implemented by the Chinese government to recruit oversea experts seems to contribute a lot to China-US scientific collaboration.","Wang, Xianwen;Xu, Shenmeng;Liu, Di;Liang, Yongxia",ArXiv e-prints,X0d74db05f;X0ff54db4c;X1fd0a1043;X51b66769f;X5573dd2a4;X5cc364368;X5cd58a648;X644226815;X6a12b0e36;X6a43198d2;X711f83044;X7cfdc1c43;X901349368;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa8f8ba34c;Xbc915ef9d;Xca65f3992;Xe4f00d59f;Xe7aaf5f7c,19,The Role of Chinese-American Scientists in China-US Scientific Collaboration: A Study in Nanotechnology,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1129,2014

Prathap's scalar measures (Energy, Exergy, and Entropy or EEE), the Integrated Impact Indicator (I3) is based on non-parametric statistics using the (100) percentiles of the distribution.

1381,"Bibliographic records related to tribology research were extracted from SCOPUS and Web of Science databases for the period of 15 years from 1998 to 2012. Macro-level scientometric indicators such as growth rate, share of international collaborative papers, citations per paper, and share of non-cited papers were employed. Further, the Gini coefficient and Simpson Index of Diversity were used. Two new relative indicators : Relative International Collaboration Rate (RICR) and Relative Growth Index (RGI) are proposed in this study. The performance of top countries contributing more than 1000 papers across the study period was discussed. Contributions and share of continents and countries by income groups were examined. Further research contributions and citation impact of selected country groups such as the Developing Eight Countries (D8), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the Emerging and Growth-Leading Economies (EAGLEs) countries were analyzed. High levels of interdisciplinarity exist in tribology research. Inequality of distribution between countries is highest for number of publications and citations. Asia outperforms the other world regions and China contributes most of the papers (25%), while the United States receives most of the citations (22%). 84% of total output was contributed by the Asiatic region, Western Europe and North America together. Publications from these three world regions received 88% of total citations. Around 50% of global research output was contributed by China, the United States and Japan.","Elango, Bakthavachalam;Rajendran, Periyaswamy;Bornmann, Lutz",ArXiv e-prints,X1281c008e;X152cfc6a5;X1989b7650;X1cd1da372;X256129a13;X2b70e1bf4;X3ad6bdff7;X409b1f143;X565245962;X575270459;X5ec92aa0c;X6618d32cd;X732a12c79;X81f8bb0ae;X951681732;X96f2e38b3;X9a1e23165;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa710f3fe2;Xbb974a514;Xc13a36fec;Xc3ae2a0a3;Xc3d4c2cdf;Xd41b9c6ba;Xdd8585a93;Xea38677fd;Xf35508cd0;Xfa8675101,29,A macro level scientometric analysis of world tribology research output (1998 - 2012),http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1625,2014
1382,"We outline a paradigm to preserve results of digital scholarship, whether they are query results, feature values, or topic assignments. This paradigm is characterized by using annotations as multifunctional carriers and making them portable. The testing grounds we have chosen are two significant enterprises, one in the history of science, and one in Hebrew scholarship. The first one (CKCC) focuses on the results of a project where a Dutch consortium of universities, research institutes, and cultural heritage institutions experimented for 4 years with language techniques and topic modeling methods with the aim to analyze the emergence of scholarly debates. The data: a complex set of about 20.000 letters. The second one (DTHB) is a multi-year effort to express the linguistic features of the Hebrew bible in a text database, which is still growing in detail and sophistication. Versions of this database are packaged in commercial bible study software. We state that the results of these forms of scholarship require new knowledge management and archive practices. Only when researchers can build efficiently on each other's (intermediate) results, they can achieve the aggregations of quality data by which new questions can be answered, and hidden patterns visualized. Archives are required to find a balance between preserving authoritative versions of sources and supporting collaborative efforts in digital scholarship. Annotations are promising vehicles for preserving and reusing research results.

1383,"Maintenance of multiple, distributed up-to-date copies of collections of changing Web resources is important in many application contexts and is often achieved using ad hoc or proprietary synchronization solutions. ResourceSync is a resource synchronization framework that integrates with the Web architecture and leverages XML sitemaps. We define a model for the ResourceSync framework as a basis for understanding its properties. We then describe experiments in which simulations of a variety of synchronization scenarios illustrate the effects of model configuration on consistency, latency, and data transfer efficiency. These results provide insight into which congurations are appropriate for various application scenarios.","Haslhofer, Bernhard;Warner, Simeon;Lagoze, Carl;Klein, Martin;Sanderson, Robert;van de Sompel, Herbert;Nelson, Michael L.",ArXiv e-prints,X064d0b8b5;X29127fdd4;X2ca7c9a93;X34d782a44;X3b04b4a94;X4e7da3b99;X6302a0ff6;X7f45548a8;X7f93137c1;X90b9f1e21;X93b4ea01c;X951bc046e;Xa6ca6d7e2;Xd63e86c37;Xef524ff51;Xf140f1565;Xf50724759,17,Web Synchronization Simulations using the ResourceSync Framework,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1073,2013
1384,"This paper analyzes the tweeting behavior of 37 astrophysicists on Twitter and compares their tweeting behavior with their publication behavior and citation impact to show whether they tweet research-related topics or not. Astrophysicists on Twitter are selected to compare their tweets with their publications from Web of Science. Different user groups are identified based on tweeting and publication frequency. A moderate negative correlation (p=-0.390*) is found between the number of publications and tweets per day, while retweet and citation rates do not correlate. The similarity between tweets and abstracts is very low (cos=0.081). User groups show different tweeting behavior such as retweeting and including hashtags, usernames and URLs. The study is limited in terms of the small set of astrophysicists. Results are not necessarily representative of the entire astrophysicist community on Twitter and they most certainly do not apply to scientists in general. Future research should apply the methods to a larger set of researchers and other scientific disciplines. To a certain extent, this study helps to understand how researchers use Twitter. The results hint at the fact that impact on Twitter can neither be equated with nor replace traditional research impact metrics. However, tweets and other so-called altmetrics might be able to reflect other impact of scientists such as public outreach and science communication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study comparing researchers' tweeting activity and behavior with scientific publication output in terms of quantity, content and impact.","Haustein, Stefanie;Bowman, Timothy D.;Holmberg, Kim;Peters, Isabella;Larivière, Vincent",ArXiv e-prints,X00c2c4c76;X00fdd9ddc;X05d919c2b;X05e37a64e;X063fe6a65;X073990fcf;X08161f983;X08537be94;X0b4d48d0d;X0bd2959ad;X0c386bb26;X0c3acc8a7;X0d0f8d5f8;X113890fb5;X115ea5cc8;X117e1b962;X152a75cda;X1568b97fd;X162423797;X16c298eec;X19278a226;X19281b38f;X19420e4e4;X19744affb;X1b4302916;X1c7f1353c;X1d7ddcb98;X21e01d5d5;X254a09665;X258f767fa;X289cca920;X2cab949b1;X2cb99fc09;X364846778;X385895035;X3b729f76e;X3d2629883;X3dba0b6e2;X3eb53a67f;X42cefaf26;X4584c98fb;X47661fd06;X4d0fc3a43;X4ec1fa0b8;X502cd911a;X51e9bb4f1;X56fee69f4;X57778de7c;X5c125fb04;X5f399cd23;X604b0ac1f;X60f838d40;X610f9ee8c;X617c42077;X618cabb47;X64de67478;X6595aa617;X65b7abec0;X65c804cf5;X674555f74;X67d4760f8;X6950291cc;X696e0144d;X69d94f914;X6c34aaf94;X6c74a1aa2;X6d4e321d2;X6ea0208c4;X707b31bd6;X7216b956e;X759ea4b66;X75e5f2c39;X77ae4078e;X7a2dabe13;X7a2f31c61;X7c00b3d79;X7d3f03970;X82d1a498b;X842b24785;X8467411e4;X859b252a1;X85cc22c21;X8922e8f13;X8a5549e5a;X8b125035d;X8cd893e94;X900ee7e80;X92604abd9;X927f27261;X95b8f4032;X99f7590e7;X9d02aaa76;X9d1be04b9;X9e6d29c60;X9f47f0ea1;X9ff0a4a55;X9ff562f18;Xa1b994b71;Xa206d28cf;Xa2ebf8c3d;Xa547d6fa6;Xa671cc921;Xa67351b02;Xa95556a3c;Xaa36375e3;Xabb8beae3;Xabdb4ab9b;Xacfea20e1;Xadff9eea9;Xae132d93f;Xaf20cf574;Xafa1d1cea;Xb0b6151d7;Xb1c7a6b52;Xb767275b5;Xb93b68740;Xbbcf65c4a;Xbf458c808;Xc178e97e2;Xc1b82e334;Xc99d5c8db;Xc9f4c929f;Xca4a66318;Xcaa6a6212;Xcb69d48d8;Xce97130fd;Xceada639f;Xcebda3645;Xceef2eb66;Xd3632433a;Xd40151fb4;Xd63ac515f;Xd883ce35e;Xdbba6a518;Xdc0c4365c;Xde0c69f86;Xdef54341c;Xe18d336b3;Xe1f010903;Xe205f8a11;Xe6a09749b;Xe81ec4878;Xe96d04d6e;Xeb837d64d;Xeb85f2dc7;Xee05288a8;Xf2517d8a2;Xf27f6ca8c;Xf305b04a0;Xf30bf381e;Xf4039ef2a;Xf404d0b42;Xf587f4abc;Xf5a83abcf;Xf666e56ef;Xf9ea41dcb;Xfa7b29d93;Xfddfdd4e7,158,Astrophysicists on Twitter: An in-depth analysis of tweeting and scientific publication behavior,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1740,2014
1385,"In this paper, we examine the evolution of the impact of non-elite journals. We attempt to answer two questions. First, what fraction of the top-cited articles are published in non-elite journals and how has this changed over time. Second, what fraction of the total citations are to non-elite journals and how has this changed over time. We studied citations to articles published in 1995-2013. We computed the 10 most-cited journals and the 1000 most-cited articles each year for all 261 subject categories in Scholar Metrics. We marked the 10 most-cited journals in a category as the elite journals for the category and the rest as non-elite. There are two conclusions from our study. First, the fraction of top-cited articles published in non-elite journals increased steadily over 1995-2013. While the elite journals still publish a substantial fraction of high-impact articles, many more authors of well-regarded papers in diverse research fields are choosing other venues. The number of top-1000 papers published in non-elite journals for the representative subject category went from 149 in 1995 to 245 in 2013, a growth of 64%. Looking at broad research areas, 4 out of 9 areas saw at least one-third of the top-cited articles published in non-elite journals in 2013. For 6 out of 9 areas, the fraction of top-cited papers published in non-elite journals for the representative subject category grew by 45% or more. Second, now that finding and reading relevant articles in non-elite journals is about as easy as finding and reading articles in elite journals, researchers are increasingly building on and citing work published everywhere. Considering citations to all articles, the percentage of citations to articles in non-elite journals went from 27% in 1995 to 47% in 2013.

1386,"The citation potential is a measure of the probability of being cited. Obviously, it is different among fields of science, social science, and humanities because of systematic differences in publication and citation behaviour across disciplines. In the past, the citation potential was studied at journal level considering the average number of references in established groups of journals (for example, the crown indicator is based on the journal subject categories in the Web of Science database). In this paper, some characterizations of the author?s scientific research through three different research dimensions are proposed: production (journal papers), impact (journal citations), and reference (bibliographical sources). Then, we propose different measures of the citation potential for authors based on a proportion of these dimensions. An empirical application, in a set of 120 randomly selected highly productive authors from the CSIC Research Centre (Spain) in four subject areas, shows that the ratio between production and impact dimensions is a normalized measure of the citation potential at the level of individual authors. Moreover, this ratio reduces the between-group variance in relation to the within-group variance in a higher proportion than the rest of the indicators analysed. Furthermore, it is consistent with the type of journal impact indicator used. A possible application of this result is in the selection and promotion process within interdisciplinary institutions, since it allows comparisons of authors based on their particular scientific research.","Dorta-Gonzalez, Pablo;Dorta-Gonzalez, Maria Isabel;Suarez-Vega, Rafael",ArXiv e-prints,X223d8511f;X276f132e4;X43ef9044c;X5e0ca5543;X6b97e93ca;Xa1b994b71;Xb96e0217c;Xc1019fb06;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xcd9c08469;Xe67690253;Xe85c6cb6a,12,An approach to the author citation potential: Measures of scientific performance which are invariant across scientific fields,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2065,2014
1387,"MELIBEA is a Spanish database that uses a composite formula with eight weighted conditions to estimate the effectiveness of Open Access mandates (registered in ROARMAP). We analyzed 68 mandated institutions for publication years 2011-2013 to determine how well the MELIBEA score and its individual conditions predict what percentage of published articles indexed by Web of Knowledge is deposited in each institution's OA repository, and when. We found a small but significant positive correlation (0.18) between MELIBEA score and deposit percentage. We also found that for three of the eight MELIBEA conditions (deposit timing, internal use, and opt-outs), one value of each was strongly associated with deposit percentage or deposit latency (immediate deposit required, deposit required for performance evaluation, unconditional opt-out allowed for the OA requirement but no opt-out for deposit requirement). When we updated the initial values and weights of the MELIBEA formula for mandate effectiveness to reflect the empirical association we had found, the score's predictive power doubled (.36). There are not yet enough OA mandates to test further mandate conditions that might contribute to mandate effectiveness, but these findings already suggest that it would be useful for future mandates to adopt these three conditions so as to maximize their effectiveness, and thereby the growth of OA.","Vincent-Lamarre, Philippe;Boivin, Jade;Gargouri, Yassine;Lariviere, Vincent;Harnad, Stevan",ArXiv e-prints,X0970d64d1;X0daf0ffbf;X18bff2d9d;X19fd72f26;X224bcd163;X2a7efa9c1;X2b43b9966;X2ce5f7bec;X2dc0798ee;X368b5dfd2;X4b96824b9;X4e7c9369f;X59b6a9510;X5a0f6b17f;X5a72e6a96;X6ba3c6ebb;X6bd4f3ea6;X6c08876ee;X700cd4198;X72e2f2c0b;X7549f250d;X7d992f1ea;X8191f57e0;X854b3e855;X90d885c3b;X9906a4883;X9aca221c2;Xa3a8e2e7d;Xa6438f997;Xacfa45f95;Xadd66b30a;Xb31f4721c;Xba6b39ce3;Xc9c2aac95;Xdaaa9ca0b;Xdc00e7655;Xe36e5e5fb;Xe9ae71aa4;Xfe02ef20c;Xfe7fb6d71,40,Estimating Open Access Mandate Effectiveness: I.

1388,"We have collected and cleaned two network data sets: Coauthorship and Citation networks for statisticians. The data sets are based on all research papers published in four of the top journals in statistics from 2003 to the first half of 2012. We analyze the data sets from many different perspectives, focusing on (a) productivity, patterns and trends, (b) centrality, and (c) community structures, and present an array of interesting findings. For (a), we find that over the 10-year period, both the average number of papers per author and the fraction of self citations have been decreasing, but the proportion of distant citations has been increasing. These suggest that the statistics community has become increasingly more collaborative, competitive, and globalized, driven by the boom of online resources and Search Engines. For (b), we identify the most prolific, the most collaborative, and the most highly cited authors. We also identify a handful of ""hot"" papers and suggest ""Variable Selection"" and several other areas as the ""hot"" areas in statistics. For (c), we have investigated the data sets with 6 different methods, including D-SCORE (a new procedure we propose here). We have identified about 15 meaningful communities, including large-size communities such as ""Biostatistics"", ""Large-Scale Multiple Testing"", ""Variable Selection"" as well as small-size communities such as ""Dimensional Reduction"", ""Objective Bayes"", ""Quantile Regression"", and ""Theoretical Machine Learning"". We find that the community structures for the Coauthorship network and Citation network are connected and intertwined, but are also different in significant ways. Our findings shed light on research habits, trends, and topological patterns of statisticians, and our data sets provide a fertile ground for future researches on or related to social networks of statisticians.","Ji, Pengsheng;Jin, Jiashun",ArXiv e-prints,X004191a4f;X046350d0e;X048299ba0;X09a018eb4;X0d3b8131c;X18a3cc441;X1b8e552c4;X1f22eb362;X208dc404e;X2dc30046c;X38ce6d203;X41b9064b8;X4386c76b7;X458ec4332;X465cff129;X49ea5883a;X4a3e05544;X528c69078;X562ba46b2;X581f412cd;X5d1f33755;X61aad778e;X674531e05;X695bbbace;X6a2b86966;X6d6fc2c93;X6dab086dc;X79e684fd3;X7ec58641e;X82b0904d4;X8d73468e4;X8fbca0043;X90d6c421b;X94286e810;X954f7b3df;X9db9cea94;X9f38582f7;X9ff0a4a55;Xa1d478bc0;Xa280db30b;Xb00c25219;Xb1cc0a94c;Xb5ab64ed7;Xb615bff15;Xc228cec74;Xc45976a43;Xc541f2bc3;Xc74268e28;Xc90d38f90;Xcf8ba3fcb;Xd4276ad27;Xd511c7c73;Xd55ac1b3b;Xd6f93799d;Xd875be1cb;Xd9cd56125;Xe4a11f550;Xeba780c7b;Xef2cc6b20;Xf9b8bc2f6,60,Coauthorship and Citation Networks for Statisticians,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2840,2014
1389,"The design of a publisher's electronic interface can have a measurable effect on electronic journal usage statistics. A study of journal usage from six COUNTER-compliant publishers at thirty-two research institutions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden indicates that the ratio of PDF to HTML views is not consistent across publisher interfaces, even after controlling for differences in publisher content. The number of fulltext downloads may be artificially inflated when publishers require users to view HTML versions before accessing PDF versions or when linking mechanisms, such as CrossRef, direct users to the full text, rather than the abstract, of each article. These results suggest that usage reports from COUNTER-compliant publishers are not directly comparable in their current form. One solution may be to modify publisher numbers with adjustment factors deemed to be representative of the benefit or disadvantage due to its interface. Standardization of some interface and linking protocols may obviate these differences and allow for more accurate cross-publisher comparisons.","Davis, Philip M.;Price, Jason S.",ArXiv e-prints,X2ef8a4546;X64495aa4a;X6e18f72c0;X9c76431be;X9e3420e43;Xafc7537f6;Xbf7a66b41;Xe9413cdba;Xf6dc057cd,9,"eJournal interface can influence usage statistics: implications for libraries, publishers, and Project COUNTER",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0602060,2006
1390,"The purpose of this study is to compare the changing behavior of two counting methods (whole counting and whole-normalized counting) and inflation rate at country level research productivity and impact. For this, publication data on tribology research published between 1998 and 2012 from SCOPUS has been used. Only internationally collaborated papers are considered for comparison between two counting methods. The result of correlation tests shows that there is highly correlation in all the four indicators between the two counting methods. However, the result of t-test shows that there is significant difference in the three indicators (paper count, citation count and h-index) between the two counting methods. This study concludes that whole-normalized counting (fractional) is the better choice for publication and citations counting at the country level assessment.","Elango, B.;Rajendran, P.",ArXiv e-prints,552674a077;X17cb79979;X2177570ef;X3172eca08;X380a97ca3;Xa1d7b19e8;Xb349115c0;Xdc3843ce2;Xdcf416fae;Xe1b387cff;Xf35508cd0,11,Whole counting vs. whole-normalized counting: A country level comparative study of internationally collaborated papers on Tribology,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2980,2014

So it becomes necessary to detect Table of Content page for easy navigation of multipage document and also to make information retrieval faster for desirable data from the multipage document. All the Table of content pages follow the different layout, different way of presenting the contents of the document like chapter, section, subsection etc. This paper introduces a new method to detect Table of content using machine learning technique with different features.

1394,"We examine the sub-field of philosophy of science using a new method developed in information science, Referenced Publication Years Spectroscopy (RPYS). RPYS allows us to identify peak years in citations in a field, which promises to help scholars identify the key contributions to a field, and revolutionary discoveries in a field. We discovered that philosophy of science, a sub-field in the humanities, differs significantly from other fields examined with this method. Books play a more important role in philosophy of science than in the sciences. Further, Einstein's famous 1905 papers created a citation peak in the philosophy of science literature. But rather than being a contribution to the philosophy of science, their importance lies in the fact that they are revolutionary contributions to physics with important implications for philosophy of science.","Wray, K.

1395,"Network Repository (NR) is the first interactive data repository with a web-based platform for visual interactive analytics. Unlike other data repositories (e.g., UCI ML Data Repository, and SNAP), the network data repository (networkrepository.com) allows users to not only download, but to interactively analyze and visualize such data using our web-based interactive graph analytics platform. Users can in real-time analyze, visualize, compare, and explore data along many different dimensions. The aim of NR is to make it easy to discover key insights into the data extremely fast with little effort while also providing a medium for users to share data, visualizations, and insights. Other key factors that differentiate NR from the current data repositories is the number of graph datasets, their size, and variety. While other data repositories are static, they also lack a means for users to collaboratively discuss a particular dataset, corrections, or challenges with using the data for certain applications. In contrast, we have incorporated many social and collaborative aspects into NR in hopes of further facilitating scientific research (e.g., users can discuss each graph, post observations, visualizations, etc.).","Rossi, Ryan A.;Ahmed, Nesreen K.",ArXiv e-prints,X05c871460;X0d6839583;X0eff2e406;X167740ed8;X1fb148476;X315b7cfe3;X36b5f4229;X385009923;X408bc509f;X40bbf395a;X4685c8146;X4e23a7218;X5388b8753;X5469445b4;X5508e2ff5;X5610dd330;X56baef614;X56e20ff5a;X5a1dc843e;X5c1696485;X6922c1e2c;X6c411eb23;X6dd82f173;X71ee8e0b3;X76ad8c07b;X7a7b55343;X82fa6b220;X8305bffaa;X8582a301b;X888a329bc;X899b6d40a;X9033e2cc5;X91c97581e;X96131927e;X98715b6eb;X988e09dd9;Xa0b9fbd3a;Xa1dc77406;Xa28f024b3;Xa927e9c6c;Xab0cd1eb0;Xb415d090d;Xb5ba310b1;Xb8d9c88b0;Xba7a2c020;Xbdbb0bc83;Xc1aafe1f7;Xc2aaaf76c;Xc33557776;Xc4e40cc39;Xc53542451;Xd2d443ba4;Xd48fa6f57;Xe14ee4b32;Xe8d826339;Xf52efcf4f;Xfb62a6e93;Xfd6c30792;Xfe147ee8f,59,NetworkRepository: A Graph Data Repository with Visual Interactive Analytics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3560,2014

1399,"Evaluative bibliometrics compares the citation impact of researchers, research groups and institutions with each other across time scales and disciplines. Both factors - discipline and period - have an influence on the citation count which is independent of the quality of the publication. Normalizing the citation impact of papers for these two factors started in the mid-1980s. Since then, a range of different methods have been presented for producing normalized citation impact scores. The current study uses a data set of over 50,000 records to test which of the methods so far presented correlate better with the assessment of papers by peers. The peer assessments come from F1000Prime - a post-publication peer review system of the biomedical literature. Of the normalized indicators, the current study involves not only cited-side indicators, such as the mean normalized citation score, but also citing-side indicators. As the results show, the correlations of the indicators with the peer assessments all turn out to be very similar. Since F1000 focuses on biomedicine, it is important that the results of this study are validated by other studies based on datasets from other disciplines or (ideally) based on multi-disciplinary datasets.","Bornmann, Lutz;Marx, Werner",ArXiv e-prints,5457dc69d9;X00bd80b2c;X0954e8445;X0d40678cf;X0f2e10d2d;X1306f43fe;X14167dbce;X1cd340498;X2502062f5;X279755f7c;X2a54f38ae;X316c41832;X328cc5779;X348814447;X3997aebaf;X40c9d2ff0;X416f3a791;X59b8e4ecc;X64baf11ac;X6556eae11;X6c9f23fc0;X7d3f03970;X7ea0e9c93;X862a31899;X8d1deadf9;X8d73468e4;X92477adf8;X937a3501e;X96f2e38b3;X9a60c3a7d;X9d91a0fde;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xbe4e39122;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xcb4ce0f83;Xcc3e03249;Xcf5136bf5;Xd70bbaacc;Xe85c6cb6a;Xeb32ae6c5;Xeef68815a;Xf782e1772,43,Methods for the generation of normalized citation impact scores in bibliometrics: Which method best reflects the judgements of experts?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5772,2014

This approach was, moreover, insufficiently flexible to deal with the semantic issues. The gMan project, on the other hand, addressed these problems by virtualizing data resources using full-text indexes, which can then be used to provide different views onto the collections and services that more closely match the sort of information organization and retrieval activities found in the humanities, in an environment that is more interactive, researcher-focused, and researcher-driven.","Blanke, Tobias;Hedges, Mark",ArXiv e-prints,X0f2e10d2d;X4caed72e4;X55e268624;X60e11c6c6;Xb4f04ce39;Xcb4ce0f83,6,Towards a Virtual Data Centre for Classics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7758,2014

1407,"This paper provides the first historical analysis of the relationship between collaboration and scientific impact, using three indicators of collaboration (number of authors, number of addresses, and number of countries) and including articles published between 1900 and 2011. The results demonstrate that an increase in the number of authors leads to an increase in impact--from the beginning of the last century onwards--and that this is not simply due to self-citations. A similar trend is also observed for the number of addresses and number of countries represented in the byline of an article. However, the constant inflation of collaboration since 1900 has resulted in diminishing citation returns: larger and more diverse (in terms of institutional and country affiliation) teams are necessary to realize higher impact. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential causes of the impact gain in citations of collaborative papers.","Lariviere, Vincent;Sugimoto, Cassidy;Tsou, Andrew;Gingras, Yves",ArXiv e-prints,X04fbb03f0;X17f37ff85;X19b3d9751;X1de755052;X2086bd367;X20aafe5b2;X2d743416d;X3d1b39757;X3f33fd887;X4157e801c;X4871cb83b;X4d19fba47;X607976150;X6222e1199;X6c64b8148;X749a2fb6b;X759e409ca;X7c7c07922;X991a8d2ee;X9cd1f0f85;Xa1b994b71;Xa5317c7d6;Xb074440b6;Xb177a693a;Xb903f0e80;Xbe5729cd9;Xc517cbd3c;Xc5ddc686c;Xc925b9b11;Xd716d48db;Xddacf0488;Xdefae5f91;Xe3c5929d1;Xe9766d4de;Xeb160b6a9;Xec15b8cdd;Xf1c64b6ef;Xf3acfdc5e;Xf838d5cff,39,Team size matters: Collaboration and scientific impact since 1900,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8544,2014
1408,"The empirical and theoretical justification of Gartner hype curves is a very relevant open question in the field of Technological Life Cycle analysis. The scope of the present paper is to introduce a simple model describing the growth of scientific/technological research impact, in the specific case where science is the main source of a new idea driving a technological development, leading to hype-type evolution curves. The main idea of the model is that, in a first stage, the growth of the scientific interest of a new specific field (as can be measured by publication numbers) basically follows the classical logistic growth curve. At a second stage, starting at a later trigger time, the technological development based on that scientific idea (as can be measured by patent deposits) can be described as the integral (in a mathematical sense) of the first curve, since technology is based on the overall accumulated scientific knowledge. The model is tested through a bibliometric analysis of the publication and patent deposit rate for Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED) scientific research and technology, as well as for other emerging technologies.","Campani, Marco;Vaglio, Ruggero",ArXiv e-prints,X063d49237;X09bb5189a;X1851e90b3;X1980b1f07;X1a69fe576;X1dfb8d46f;X1fb0af2f1;X26c9d2f4e;X29f64fd21;X2c10e9af1;X2e14c7105;X309f0eeee;X3957b3d46;X4a1351b50;X4efa2514e;X55d16dbfa;X573bdceef;X64a8ca96e;X6bcb4061c;X6e203400d;X6e4e4270a;X6f4ce1d1e;X7787201a3;X7da2f0282;X8b9b9b848;X93fb8ed63;X94b49a979;Xa14f38f4b;Xa1b994b71;Xab3db709a;Xba0b82f74;Xbcc39e084;Xc30e3b9aa;Xcd04d6daf;Xd03c0bd3c;Xd43e69e68;Xd45981822;Xdf2c9211c;Xe3a3b5f18;Xe4dc6e366;Xf5b53c88e;Xf75dbcfd1;Xf7a851140,43,A simple interpretation of the growth of scientific/technological research impact leading to hype-type evolution curves,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8685,2014
1409,"The combination of informetric analysis and information retrieval allows a twofold application. (1) While in-formetrics analysis is primarily used to gain insights into a scientific domain, it can be used to build recommen-dation or alternative ranking services. They are usually based on methods like co-occurrence or citation analyses. (2) Information retrieval and its decades-long tradition of rigorous evaluation using standard document corpora, predefined topics and relevance judgements can be used as a test bed for informetric analyses. We show a preliminary experiment on how both domains can be connected using the iSearch test collection, a standard information retrieval test collection derived from the open access arXiv.org preprint server. In this paper the aim is to draw a conclusion about the appropriateness of iSearch as a test bed for the evaluation of a retrieval or recommendation system that applies informetric methods to improve retrieval results for the user. Based on an interview study with physicists, bibliographic coupling and author-co-citation analysis, important authors for ten different research questions are identified. The results show that the analysed corpus includes these authors and their corresponding documents. This study is a first step towards a combination of retrieval evaluations and the evaluation of informetric analyses methods.","Heck, Tamara;Schaer, Philipp",ArXiv e-prints,X0b3e26a84;X1d5da83cb;X5535fa7d6;X7ac8bb2ae;X899b6d40a;Xa1b994b71;Xaa84ce454;Xaef022546;Xb085070a5;Xc2195d0d3;Xc369f5355;Xda1ac6e53;Xebfc14e25;Xfceb5bde6,14,Performing Informetric Analysis on Information Retrieval Test Collections: Preliminary Experiments in the Physics Domain,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1743,2013

1411,"In this paper, we examine the evolution of the impact of older scholarly articles. We attempt to answer four questions. First, how often are older articles cited and how has this changed over time. Second, how does the impact of older articles vary across different research fields. Third, is the change in the impact of older articles accelerating or slowing down. Fourth, are these trends different for much older articles. To answer these questions, we studied citations from articles published in 1990-2013. We computed the fraction of citations to older articles from articles published each year as the measure of impact. We considered articles that were published at least 10 years before the citing article as older articles. We computed these numbers for 261 subject categories and 9 broad areas of research. Finally, we repeated the computation for two other definitions of older articles, 15 years and older and 20 years and older. There are three conclusions from our study. First, the impact of older articles has grown substantially over 1990-2013. In 2013, 36% of citations were to articles that are at least 10 years old; this fraction has grown 28% since 1990. The fraction of older citations increased over 1990-2013 for 7 out of 9 broad areas and 231 out of 261 subject categories. Second, the increase over the second half (2002-2013) was double the increase in the first half (1990-2001). Third, the trend of a growing impact of older articles also holds for even older articles. In 2013, 21% of citations were to articles 〉= 15 years old with an increase of 30% since 1990 and 13% of citations were to articles 〉= 20 years old with an increase of 36%. Now that finding and reading relevant older articles is about as easy as finding and reading recently published articles, significant advances aren't getting lost on the shelves and are influencing work worldwide for years after.","Verstak, Alex;Acharya, Anurag;Suzuki, Helder;Henderson, Sean;Iakhiaev, Mikhail;Lin, Cliff Chiung Yu;Shetty, Namit",ArXiv

1412,"Ramanujacharyulu's (1964) Power-Weakness Ratio (PWR) measures impact by recursively multiplying the citation matrix by itself until convergence is reached in both the cited and citing dimensions; the quotient of these values is defined as PWR, whereby ""cited"" is considered as power and ""citing"" as weakness. In this study, PWR is explained in relation to other size-independent recursive metrics such as Pinski & Narin's (1976) influence weights, Bergstrom's (2007) Eigenfactor, Brin & Page's (2001) PageRank, and Kleinberg's (1999) Hubs-and-Authorities from the HITS algorithm. A test using the set of 83 journals in ""information and library science"" (according to the Web-of-Science categorization) converged, but did not provide interpretable results. Further decomposition of this set into homogeneous sub-graphs shows that--like most other journal indicators--PWR can perhaps be used within homogeneous sets, but not across citation communities.","Leydesdorff, Loet;de Nooy, Wouter;Bornmann, Lutz;Prathap, Gangan",ArXiv e-prints,X0b4d4a349;X0c98f5a1c;X0f474c680;X15238ab82;X25f61589b;X4c9f064ba;X55bc8404e;X5c33e4a93;X5d1ed9082;X5fa1fb96a;X630123db9;X685f4bd47;X6a4d56723;X6d9b343e9;X798b20937;X79cd7a0b6;X8016d1949;X868e11c94;X889b81d3d;X8a7e910d2;X8ad14b27a;X96f2e38b3;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa70ca8eb6;Xb54401013;Xb8ca6f5e0;Xb9513f80e;Xc196e1a7e;Xc6ba0c5e6;Xd19ece475;Xd1c8e507e;Xd72e03dbb;Xe72cc180e;Xe80eec3bb;Xe8ad11dc0;Xeeb5702f3;Xf907854c7;Xfa5b56dd3;Xfa65230a9;Xfe52de57a,42,"The ""Tournaments"" Metaphor in Citation Impact Studies: Power-Weakness Ratios (PWR) as a Journal Indicator",http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0906,2014
1413,"This paper presents proof that Google Scholar (GS) can construct documentary sets relevant for evaluating researchers' works. Nobelists in economics were the researchers under analysis, and two types of tests of the GS cites to their works were performed: distributional and semantic. Distributional tests found that the GS cites to the laureates' works conformed to the power-law model with an asymptote or ""tail"" conterminous with their h-index demarcating their core oeuvre, validating both GS and the h-index. Semantic tests revealed that their works highest in GS cites were on topics for which they were awarded the prize.","Bensman, Stephen J.;Daugherty, Alice;Smolinsky, Lawrence J.;Sage, Daniel S.;Sylvan Katz, J.",ArXiv e-prints,X298af7643;X399c9d349;X3bfb5167d;X44f7c4f5b;X4941803da;X4983946bd;X4998a9769;X51560748b;X54a738b0a;X5c0fe4517;X5ed008c7b;X70b0148cd;X787aa476d;X7ac1a5156;X7d9b3bb53;X83e055dae;X899b6d40a;X9007cc35c;X900dc356e;X91a5b2347;X96b429fac;X97a736c0c;Xa7f87dbbd;Xaf047dd56;Xb58006fe7;Xb599b5377;Xb641dcfb1;Xba1e8a9b3;Xc5407d65a;Xc768e27bc;Xdc297ad99;Xe70a868cf;Xe85c6cb6a;Xec5107dcd;Xffefc3366,35,"Power-law distributions, the h-index, and Google Scholar (GS) citations: a test of their relationship with economics Nobelists",http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0928,2014
1414,"A constant influx of new data poses a challenge in keeping the annotation in biological databases current. Most biological databases contain significant quantities of textual annotation, which often contains the richest source of knowledge. Many databases reuse existing knowledge, during the curation process annotations are often propagated between entries. However, this is often not made explicit. Therefore, it can be hard, potentially impossible, for a reader to identify where an annotation originated from. Within this work we attempt to identify annotation provenance and track its subsequent propagation. Specifically, we exploit annotation reuse within the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), at the level of individual sentences. We describe a visualisation approach for the provenance and propagation of sentences in UniProtKB which enables a large-scale statistical analysis. Initially levels of sentence reuse within UniProtKB were analysed, showing that reuse is heavily prevalent, which enables the tracking of provenance and propagation. By analysing sentences throughout UniProtKB, a number of interesting propagation patterns were identified, covering over 100, 000 sentences. Over 8000 sentences remain in the database after they have been removed from the entries where they originally occurred. Analysing a subset of these sentences suggest that approximately 30% are erroneous, whilst 35% appear to be inconsistent. These results suggest that being able to visualise sentence propagation and provenance can aid in the determination of the accuracy and quality of textual annotation. Source code and supplementary data are available from the authors website.","Bell, Michael J.;Collison, Matthew;Lord, Phillip",PLoS ONE,X2f4627b83;X539bb6830;X8efdf4173;Xb1013c949;Xc318daba9;Xcb34657cf,6,Can Inferred Provenance and Its Visualisation Be Used to Detect Erroneous Annotation?

1415,"Globalization and the world wide web has resulted in academia and science being an international and multicultural community forged by researchers and scientists with different ethnicities. How ethnicity shapes the evolution of membership, status and interactions of the scientific community, however, is not well understood. This is due to the difficulty of ethnicity identification at the large scale. We use name ethnicity classification as an indicator of ethnicity. Based on automatic name ethnicity classification of 1.7+ million authors gathered from Web, the name ethnicity of computer science scholars is investigated by population size, publication contribution and collaboration strength. By showing the evolution of name ethnicity from 1936 to 2010, we discover that ethnicity diversity has increased significantly over time and that different research communities in certain publication venues have different ethnicity compositions. We notice a clear rise in the number of Asian name ethnicities in papers. Their fraction of publication contribution increases from approximately 10% to near 50% from 1970 to 2010. We also find that name ethnicity acts as a homophily factor on coauthor networks, shaping the formation of coauthorship as well as evolution of research communities.","Wu, Zhaohui;Yuan, Dayu;Treeratpituk, Pucktada;Giles, C.

1416,"Here we describe the Bibliometric Indicators for Publishers Project, an initiative undertaken by EC3Metrics SL for the analysis and development of indicators based on books and book chapters. Its goal is to study and analyze the publication and citation patterns of books and book chapters considering academic publishers as the unit of analysis. It aims at developing new methodologies and indicators that can better capture and define the research impact of publishers. It is an on-going project in which data sources and indicators are tested. We consider academic publishers as an analogy of journals, focusing on them as the unit of analysis. In this working paper we present the http://bipublishers.es website where all findings derived from the project are displayed. We describe the data retrieval and normalization process and we show the main results. A total 482,470 records have been retrieved and processed, identifying 342 publishers from which 254 have been analyzed. Then six indicators have been calculated for each publisher for four fields and 38 disciplines and displayed.","Robinson-Garcia, Nicolas;Jimenez-Contreras, Evaristo;Fuente-Gutierrez, Enrique;Torres-Salinas, Daniel",ArXiv e-prints,X01d8f11df;X0201d6abd;X09ef0a645;X101474a24;X204cebcd0;X26460c121;X2e6dbbf4d;X2eb741405;X3c23932eb;X3c5433aa5;X59c424940;X61ef2e19c;X6334c3916;X67fe7ad61;X73b54a1e0;X769f85a67;X7fa883607;X8be5e54a3;X937a3501e;X9c779a82c;Xa1b994b71;Xb40f46a29;Xbb78aca67;Xca9606066;Xce494b2ae;Xd2b6e5921;Xe399e8e7b;Xea92f1243;Xf18065efc;Xf3f73c171,30,"Bibliometric Indicators for Publishers: Data processing, indicators and interpretation",http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1361,2014

However, these languages show limited applicability in terms of enactment over distributed systems paradigms like Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based grid computing. This paper investigates RAD modelling of a Scientific Publishing Process (SPP) for Digital Libraries (DL) and tries to determine the suitability of Pi-Calculus based formal approaches to enact SOA based grid computing. In order to achieve this purpose, the Pi-Calculus based formal transformation from a RAD model of SPP for DL draws attention towards a number of challenging issues including issues that require particular design considerations for appropriate enactment in a SOA based grid system.","Khan, Zaheer Abbas;Odeh, Mohammed;McClatchey, Richard",ArXiv e-prints,X060c29765;X1ab2ebef5;X1be0cf804;X242da794b;X3f7a545fe;X4126e1063;X4e1e44d4d;X518eb4786;Xa8fd41c63;Xc74cb5eda;Xff3a29346,11,Digital Libraries: From Process Modelling to Grid-based Service Oriented Architecture,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0602082,2006

1420,"A public preprint server such as arXiv allows authors to publish their manuscripts before submitting them to journals for peer review. It offers the chance to establish priority by making the results available upon completion. This article presents the arXiv section Quantitative Biology and investigates the advantages of preprint publications in terms of reception, which can be measured by means of citations. This paper focuses on the publication and citation delay, citation counts and the authors publishing their e-prints on arXiv. Moreover, the paper discusses the benefit for scientists as well as publishers. The results that are based on 12 selected journals show that submitting preprints to arXiv has become more common in the past few years, but the number of papers submitted to Quantitative Biology is still small and represents only a fraction of the total research output in biology. An immense advantage of arXiv is to overcome the long publication delay resulting from peer review. Although preprints are visible prior to the officially published articles, a significant citation advantage was only found for the Journal of Theoretical Biology.","Aman, Valeria",ArXiv e-prints,544231c561;X00a25363b;X040cccea0;X0a5173110;X0e39be57e;X1b917d9ac;X200635e71;X23c2eb3bd;X2606b3a22;X282e97454;X28972f5fe;X324aae21a;X3292f2362;X365944fe5;X3aec75b6a;X4264261b0;X4fbb4517c;X5a2880fc1;X668ca5ea2;X682f9ad60;X6f4ab4334;X82d31c5c8;X8be61864e;X8cdb5e78e;X8d2d73929;X8f546fb94;X959e3c132;X997c15bb7;Xaf20d1ffb;Xb59b48a42;Xca9f62aad;Xd77d9c1f2;Xd93f3cadc;Xd9aa8193b;Xe233aff9a;Xe5599f747;Xe5979d3d2;Xea9529beb;Xed0f8b47c;Xee71c64eb,40,Is there any measurable benefit in publishing preprints in the arXiv section Quantitative Biology?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1955,2014

1424,"The creation of open archives i.e. archives where access is regulated by open licensing models (content, source, data), should be seen as part of a broader socio-economic phenomenon that finds legal expression in specific organizational and technical formats.This paper examines the origins and main characteristics of the open archives phenomenon. We investigate the extent to which different models of production of economic or social value can be expressed in different forms of licensing in the context of open archives. Through this process, we assess the extent to which the digital archive is moving towards providing access that is deeper (meaning, that offers more access rights) and wider (in the sense that most of the information given is in open content licensing) or face a gradual stratification and polarization of the content. Such stratification entails the emergence of two types of content: content to which access is extremely limited and content to which access remains completely open. This differentiation between classes of content is the result of multiple factors: from purely legislative, administrative and contractual restrictions (e.g. data protection and confidentiality restrictions) to information economics (e.g. peer production) or social (minimum universal access). We claim that with respect to the access management model, most of the current archiving processes include elements of openness. Usually, this is the result of economic necessity expressed in licensing instruments or organisational arrangements. The viability and the socio-economic importance of the digital archives also contributes to the use of open archiving practices. In such a context, although pure forms of open digital archives may remain an ideal, the reality of hybrid open digital archives is a necessity.","Tsiavos, Prodromos;Stefaneas, Petros",ArXiv e-prints,X0a84fb99d;X20f19cd8d;X518b80d01;X61db5e94a;X8019f7279;X88a60a003;X8af0834e1;X8ea2c192b;X8f1fe800d;X9fee7cd54;Xa469b6be5;Xad2d648f7;Xc51a4d273;Xc7054e235;Xd7ab3b1fc;Xe90a8755e,16,"Beyond the Boundaries of Open, Closed and Pirate Archives: Lessons from a Hybrid Approach",http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0680,2011

(2014, in early view) reported cyclical patterns in the longitudinal development of Rao-Stirling diversity. We suggested that these cyclical patterns can be used to indicate technological life-cycles. Upon decomposition, however, the cycles are exclusively due to increases and decreases in the variety of the classifications, and not to disparity or technological distance, measured as (1 - cosine). The cyclical patterns are associated with the numbers of inventors in the respective technologies. Sometimes increased variety leads to a boost in the number of inventors, but in early phases--when the technology is still under construction--it can also be the other way round.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X03a861a0d;X04714dfbc;X0b559beb5;X1ca0dcf1e;X2c65c77c2;X2f5d038a4;X414b119a4;X55fb127ca;X55ff57b1c;X5cd522025;X6219ca39b;X6d1be79d0;X7afec0cd3;X868e11c94;X91ac840e3;X96f2e38b3;X9b44255a1;X9bc2e85d9;X9cd764f08;Xa077e8133;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa7d69d3f2;Xbe4e39122;Xd1c32bea2,24,Can Technology Life-Cycles Be Indicated by Diversity in Patent Classifications?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2858,2014
1426,"Making available and archiving scientific results is for the most part still considered the task of classical publishing companies, despite the fact that classical forms of publishing centered around printed narrative articles no longer seem well-suited in the digital age. In particular, there exist currently no efficient, reliable, and agreed-upon methods for publishing scientific datasets, which have become increasingly important for science. Here we propose to design scientific data publishing as a Web-based bottom-up process, without top-down control of central authorities such as publishing companies. We present a protocol and a server network to decentrally store and archive data in the form of nanopublications, an RDF-based format to represent scientific data with formal semantics. We show how this approach allows researchers to produce, publish, retrieve, address, verify, and recombine datasets and their individual nanopublications in a reliable and trustworthy manner, and we argue that this architecture could be used for the Semantic Web in general. Our evaluation of the current small network shows that this system is efficient and reliable, and we discuss how it could grow to handle the large amounts of structured data that modern science is producing and consuming.","Kuhn, Tobias;Chichester, Christine;Dumontier, Michel;Krauthammer, Michael",ArXiv e-prints,X002a30c24;X056362c0f;X05a8a5d10;X114840220;X116633ffc;X18fa69247;X1ac634cdc;X1cf89f3da;X20e0888ca;X2ba29801e;X2dfc34583;X2ec895505;X2f15d4a4c;X31f8fedc6;X324aae21a;X3731f6811;X3f9e71579;X421c5de6d;X437f25af1;X4663f41ad;X46c39dcee;X483f78cd6;X4b6476189;X507c373c1;X579f04b26;X5ba6ebd76;X5cacc23cf;X674531e05;X67a531590;X68ffcb4e5;X6d48968d2;X6f8a207d9;X71b03f698;X79fface2c;X8306935ed;X848c1ed46;X87729a23e;X8c16b07bb;X8d6445159;X8e46e1387;X90422f0c8;X915c919b1;X96b429fac;X980569ad2;X995ff3dca;X9dfc983e9;X9f9566c45;X9ff0a4a55;Xa0ae8c162;Xa517ac897;Xa58c36aeb;Xa89bf495c;Xaab1b7f5f;Xb3040917d;Xb71074f55;Xb7a74f3f8;Xb86bdf63c;Xbbfdf3fca;Xc0342a229;Xc0d2dc06d;Xc1c916f74;Xc337aa09c;Xc48b6260a;Xc6b8fa295;Xc6d55479c;Xcad8416c4;Xcf921be27;Xd5a702b70;Xd6f93799d;Xd796f932b;Xdb39ba7e3;Xdd410204b;Xde80cb231;Xe6e1d7682;Xe74eb1a2b;Xe85adef84;Xecf2e24dc;Xee5530af0;Xeecfac469;Xf9146e81c;Xfe3023020;Xff652438a,82,"Publishing without Publishers: a Decentralized Approach to Dissemination, Retrieval, and Archiving of Data",http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2749,2014

1428,"Analyzing a large data set of publications drawn from the most competitive journals in the natural and social sciences we show that research careers exhibit the broad distributions of individual achievement characteristic of systems in which cumulative advantage plays a key role. While most researchers are personally aware of the competition implicit in the publication process, little is known about the levels of inequality at the level of individual researchers. We analyzed both productivity and impact measures for a large set of researchers publishing in high-impact journals. For each researcher cohort we calculated Gini inequality coefficients, with average Gini values around 0.48 for total publications and 0.73 for total citations. For perspective, these observed values are well in excess of the inequality levels observed for personal income in developing countries. Investigating possible sources of this inequality, we identify two potential mechanisms that act at the level of the individual that may play defining roles in the emergence of the broad productivity and impact distributions found in science. First, we show that the average time interval between a researcher's successive publications in top journals decreases with each subsequent publication. Second, after controlling for the time dependent features of citation distributions, we compare the citation impact of subsequent publications within a researcher's publication record. We find that as researchers continue to publish in top journals, there is more likely to be a decreasing trend in the relative citation impact with each subsequent publication. This pattern highlights the difficulty of repeatedly publishing high-impact research and the intriguing possibility that confirmation bias plays a role in the evaluation of scientific careers.","Petersen, Alexander M.;Penner, Orion",ArXiv e-prints,X0c9fdfb79;X2ce12da9b;X3f5c170c3;X528612e7d;X5a7207132;X77307add9;X92948820a;Xa52e45a51;Xa78acbd40;Xa7befc60a;Xb082c1992;Xdad6086b8;Xe7aaf5f7c;Xf5ba4241f,14,Inequality and cumulative advantage in science careers: a case study of high-impact journals,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5945,2014

1433,"This presentation discusses a new, modular, more mature architecture for the Information Flow Framework (IFF). The IFF uses institution theory as a foundation for the semantic integration of ontologies. It represents metalogic, and as such operates at the structural level of ontologies. The content, form and experience of the IFF could contribute to the development of a standard ontology for category theory. The foundational aspect of the IFF helps to explain the relationship between the fundamental concepts of set theory and category theory. The development of the IFF follows two design principles: conceptual warrant and categorical design. Both are limitations of the logical expression. Conceptual warrant limits the content of logical expression, by requiring us to justify the introduction of new terminology (and attendant axiomatizations). Categorical design limits the form of logical expression (of all mathematical concepts and constraints) to atomic expressions: declarations, equations or relational expressions. The IFF is a descriptive category metatheory. It is descriptive, since it follows the principle of conceptual warrant; it is categorical, since it follows the principle of categorical design; and it is a metatheory, since it provides a framework for all theories.","Kent, Robert E.",ArXiv e-prints,X004e17fe3;X10037a8c0;X13f717e73;X1fce3e598;X32fb82932;X3c03a1021;X41e668766;X45020d1ff;X5d152a4d3;X7250b63b7;X754736529;X8700f7949;X8e5a60670;X9cc5e5fe3;X9d7a7d049;Xa09a1b1ba;Xb83cc5144;Xb9cb657c8;Xbd6b7abc1;Xc05b212ea;Xc20da2d09;Xc61edd804;Xd6a3837a6;Xf8be5b368,24,The Information Flow Framework: New architecture,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0983,2011

1435,"Citation metrics are becoming pervasive in the quantitative evaluation of scholars, journals and institutions. More then ever before, hiring, promotion, and funding decisions rely on a variety of impact metrics that cannot disentangle quality from quantity of scientific output, and are biased by factors such as discipline and academic age. Biases affecting the evaluation of single papers are compounded when one aggregates citation-based metrics across an entire publication record. It is not trivial to compare the quality of two scholars that during their careers have published at different rates in different disciplines in different periods of time. We propose a novel solution based on the generation of a statistical baseline specifically tailored on the academic profile of each researcher. Our method can decouple the roles of quantity and quality of publications to explain how a certain level of impact is achieved. The method is flexible enough to allow for the evaluation of, and fair comparison among, arbitrary collections of papers --- scholar publication records, journals, and entire institutions; and can be extended to simultaneously suppresses any source of bias. We show that our method can capture the quality of the work of Nobel laureates irrespective of number of publications, academic age, and discipline, even when traditional metrics indicate low impact in absolute terms. We further apply our methodology to almost a million scholars and over six thousand journals to measure the impact that cannot be explained by the volume of publications alone.","Kaur, Jasleen;Ferrara, Emilio;Menczer, Filippo;Flammini, Alessandro;Radicchi, Filippo",ArXiv e-prints,54ef4524ac;5502f5fab4;X054813239;X0b01580ad;X0c8593903;X0f026462b;X10b40c723;X10f56eb50;X11a093528;X19ac28571;X1a9d79e4c;X1b428b7a5;X1c43aea95;X1deb528c2;X221c0c3c2;X231ba61ef;X30cd2689b;X31f8fedc6;X408bc509f;X492871416;X4afaa28b6;X4b84ca830;X4def7017e;X4e00af760;X53e37facc;X56ef9392e;X5a466b2c1;X5c1696485;X5c51e1d4f;X5f8feadc0;X62176d44d;X623426da7;X642a2d668;X655532fce;X6922c1e2c;X6cc9aec21;X77c3f46c1;X7cd5f4aa7;X908380afd;X961f31c17;X98715b6eb;X9a44f4223;X9c46fdb05;X9db9cea94;Xa293766ef;Xa4f9bcb3e;Xa5d154b5e;Xa927e9c6c;Xab0cd1eb0;Xadff0b312;Xaf047dd56;Xaf95f0a06;Xb0ba8b030;Xb302535a4;Xb4f1a77fe;Xbba2dcd71;Xbc0bb839a;Xc4e40cc39;Xc536b0a96;Xd1abe56a7;Xd215bca31;Xd48fa6f57;Xd8d6d8951;Xdad46a502;Xdca7ddf50;Xdf20f9e2d;Xe07d321e5;Xe082e11a6;Xe424afdea;Xe59456fb7;Xe6377aa81;Xe6474836b;Xeb35be962;Xedabe786d;Xee0b752fb;Xef8bcf0b1;Xf28168b8e;Xfb62a6e93,78,Quality versus quantity in scientific impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7357,2014
1436,"In spite of the development of content-based data management, text-based searching remains the primary means of multimedia retrieval in many areas. Automatic creation of text metadata is thus a crucial tool for increasing the findability of multimedia objects. Search-based annotation tools try to provide content-descriptive keywords by exploiting web data, which are easily available but unstructured and noisy. Such data need to be analyzed with the help of semantic resources that provide knowledge about objects and relationships in a given domain. In this paper, we focus on the task of general-purpose image annotation and present the VCO, a new ontology of visual concepts developed as a part of image annotation framework. The ontology is linked with the WordNet lexical database, so the annotation tools can easily integrate information from both these resources.","Botorek, Jan;Budikova, Petra;Zezula, Pavel",ArXiv e-prints,X01b5340de;X04182bd28;X0519ca70c;X0ccae3a3a;X0ce6c9ed6;X0f0f921f0;X12973979d;X13ecd0809;X164364dcb;X1f09f6b33;X21f85ff46;X25b2669e8;X262068145;X264dbacca;X28223bdee;X2c21c5337;X2c402393f;X2d0454223;X34014dcb6;X3538da58f;X37942bc67;X39a7c081f;X39f154b63;X3a80faf39;X3b32be1af;X3c868ea93;X3ef0b716b;X4003a47bf;X4289eb519;X4606a6c9b;X4713da7ce;X47a1586a8;X4a3d4e6ee;X4a424e9f7;X4b0de8755;X506ebd2b6;X54dce3e58;X5df72bf5f;X5eb1655f9;X5edf29907;X5fe4fab01;X6569b47bf;X667fa455b;X6ba2612ad;X6c6e920ec;X6fec6d2d0;X7298f809d;X7532f912c;X7b750ec65;X7bd0dccd6;X7e86b51c7;X80b0db7cf;X819f600f5;X83fb92de3;X84e766f2e;X8694a8318;X86c9437f7;X8768ddcb7;X8779f763a;X899b6d40a;X89c0f272a;X8a9f66a37;X8b7df2537;X971135033;X98ed42375;X994520f58;Xa10e24574;Xa895b1906;Xaa36c8db1;Xaa894c2f0;Xab1e9fc54;Xabc485710;Xacdcad731;Xb46d77426;Xbac9f9105;Xbfd490c47;Xc12a2e5fb;Xc5544e221;Xca137db52;Xca21e5436;Xd5e0aa6e3;Xd6acb6095;Xdd1cb4679;Xe01c21485;Xf41562b42;Xf64e3eb94;Xf770a5cfe;Xf8f712901;Xfb0e4340e;Xfb90745cb,90,Visual Concept Ontology for Image Annotations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6082,2014

1439,"We consider the incidence of text ""reuse"" by researchers, via a systematic pairwise comparison of the text content of all articles deposited to arXiv.org from 1991--2012. We measure the global frequencies of three classes of text reuse, and measure how chronic text reuse is distributed among authors in the dataset. We infer a baseline for accepted practice, perhaps surprisingly permissive compared with other societal contexts, and a clearly delineated set of aberrant authors. We find a negative correlation between the amount of reused text in an article and its influence, as measured by subsequent citations. Finally, we consider the distribution of countries of origin of articles containing large amounts of reused text.","Citron, Daniel T.;Ginsparg, Paul",Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,532e136427;54ef496da3;54f66a7539;X005a2fe25;X00aec6d50;X01ca9e196;X01f4268db;X020131530;X027eb15f7;X04ff114db;X050363e5c;X057d008b5;X07729bd42;X07bbe0aa2;X081e4c74f;X08537be94;X0855cc451;X0a5173110;X0a77cc5ea;X0b43a6a77;X0bdee5cb2;X0d2500f23;X0d6e2960c;X0eaf37eeb;X10865c32f;X10c833095;X132d2e504;X153d92d46;X15a99ebe5;X16f159fea;X18b3235cf;X1948e8e93;X1a975635d;X1b49b3c0e;X1b4a6d580;X1bb509ddf;X1c233b126;X1d90e9973;X1df7b1559;X1f353b8a8;X228b222aa;X2336d613a;X235ba5ff8;X24651ec6e;X28a01318d;X2933d4a7d;X2987f2c50;X2b43b9966;X2dd1d040e;X2f1aa9fc3;X2f54f2f0b;X3128e0851;X332c0edc6;X34b88d186;X3749b6b9b;X388cadbee;X38947be73;X3a3a46b8d;X3bb17c6af;X3d3684ab2;X3decd5492;X3e20e5fe8;X3ee27493d;X3fc51e1b3;X4016cd116;X43005d8db;X441f01ede;X4421cf965;X442e617b1;X45ad73909;X461768986;X46c39dcee;X47c94e52f;X496148d50;X4b680bc04;X4d5a2d92f;X4db4742bd;X4e3fa00bc;X502244fac;X53108d947;X5569cb381;X55d5508d6;X56cf00f47;X584026703;X59d8f83aa;X5ac5615fc;X5b92e1c3d;X5bb22d867;X5cf3075f7;X5f7fbb2be;X60f916dac;X61a000f0c;X623ac3127;X64014be8a;X6424ababe;X64669073a;X66755439f;X67e00f879;X6ba3c6ebb;X6ca2f092e;X6cee2aa06;X722bf45a5;X73570f426;X736bdbce2;X73ae03b9e;X755efe0ad;X75dea7b15;X762a3c8b8;X7720c06cf;X77fd75460;X794dbf032;X79fface2c;X7aad426bd;X7af240be2;X7bd0dccd6;X7c2d983b5;X7c4126f67;X7c5417e87;X7cf96383e;X8038843cf;X81bf8fca2;X83df1c78a;X84473bd25;X86ce2b5f6;X86f62642c;X875783253;X8839f20b5;X8870ea07c;X888a329bc;X8afa48272;X8b732c878;X8ba6de81c;X8cbaca389;X8ddc3b6a7;X8e017a25f;X8f2433510;X8f482a850;X8f9b48280;X90728ecd7;X91889ec33;X92393256d;X92993a396;X940e42e77;X941635843;X9639a9f9d;X96640e9e1;X9969db4d0;X9b5a7c740;X9c6d654a2;X9d8a0e3d1;X9d8beb562;X9db9cea94;X9ec4529ef;X9ec47eb33;X9f26bdb31;X9f96750ae;X9fa276f4f;X9ff0a4a55;X9ff5ff437;Xa013b3478;Xa2e544be2;Xa42c29ae4;Xa6592a11e;Xa87302ca2;Xaabcf1c36;Xaad3ed789;Xae6fad172;Xaec8580cf;Xaf8889dc3;Xb026a94ed;Xb0ac3c896;Xb1bccc9ae;Xb244c7803;Xb794dcdbd;Xb8c526ec1;Xb93ad5e38;Xb9c05f1f3;Xba7fd0719;Xbde2153e9;Xc0faa2f12;Xc13331a39;Xc2f7aec3b;Xc30e3b9aa;Xc3fc3575d;Xc443b0e1d;Xc536b0a96;Xc54687c60;Xc884f3376;Xcb1b7df6e;Xcbf34e45f;Xccaf045da;Xcce80811d;Xcd62c947a;Xcdb70b5ab;Xcddea854a;Xce8cef1bc;Xced57cda0;Xceeb5e71a;Xcf2da5642;Xd0153c3cf;Xd114ae610;Xd1b750bf8;Xd22bb8342;Xd2c487a65;Xd36f42f36;Xd5352f25e;Xd5411484d;Xd57383875;Xd5e0aa6e3;Xd6cc49119;Xd7d3213d0;Xd8f291b17;Xda52e091b;Xdad6086b8;Xdc2dbf943;Xddc09dc93;Xdf2c4a773;Xdfc50841a;Xdfeaf4fa3;Xe22acd3d6;Xe27675d5d;Xe5e8139ff;Xe76ef98fe;Xe7c3d2f63;Xe7eb3526d;Xe8028dfde;Xe85c6cb6a;Xe92ed7354;Xebfa8435f;Xec02e2ee1;Xee40ea919;Xeecd14c46;Xf0f42c5a8;Xf2e1fe454;Xf6b2cd478;Xf780babcc;Xf7adbaabe;Xf814f71ca;Xf8fb72f9d;Xf9bef675d;Xfb8937b29;Xfc56ff68e;Xfc73efa50;Xfce330ea1;Xfd34a6db1;Xfd987a92b;Xfe02ef20c;Xfe5375bcb;Xfe7fb6d71,249,Patterns of text reuse in a scientific corpus,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2716,2015
1440,"Identifying literary, scientific, and technical works of enduring interest is challenging. Few are able to name significant works across more than a handful of domains or languages. This paper introduces an automatic method for identifying authors of notable works throughout history. Notability is defined using the record of which works volunteers have made available in public domain digital editions. A significant benefit of this bottom-up approach is that it also provides a novel and reproducible index of notability for all individuals with Wikipedia pages. The method promises to supplement the work of cultural organizations and institutions seeking to publicize the availability of notable works and prioritize works for preservation and digitization.","Riddell, Allen B.",ArXiv e-prints,X04158097c;X08d3ff5e3;X0dd9f7107;X0ff0d1f17;X1a5d0109f;X1c640cdb6;X1cbc41d9b;X2c1722614;X30288d195;X32e3cd14a;X3d98b4e6d;X3f7c38820;X45641ec72;X479df81f5;X48d9c75e6;X4c2d519a7;X4ca8d82bb;X4e12d5608;X5095ef3e9;X50bb4d005;X52e86770d;X52fa35564;X543ffc1f9;X5476036cd;X54b44fe30;X55d5d7546;X582c3316b;X586bb004d;X59741edf5;X5fc135912;X6135a4a18;X6453fd5c8;X659799cf4;X67f9857f8;X7131fc78b;X757547b62;X76cc8ae46;X773070ba0;X785fb29bb;X82b0904d4;X869d72353;X87d46bbd7;X8854861aa;X88d48ba7c;X89900e64f;X8a19e8b55;X9142fa2f3;X92477adf8;X97bf2236e;X9c1a2a93f;Xa081b6528;Xa0fd1584b;Xa25bfd5f8;Xa69eba211;Xa7de6e152;Xb02ae2720;Xb5aede7e6;Xb5da90073;Xb8e39957f;Xba5e2b840;Xba6735049;Xbde2153e9;Xbf0363d53;Xc2fff1b33;Xc40878cfa;Xc47151397;Xc4bbce276;Xc76d0b86d;Xc78eabf12;Xce36d1aba;Xcf0229340;Xd5ea0c124;Xd6f93799d;Xd7d3fe6a6;Xe10d7ddf9;Xe3bf2db2a;Xe4c1e782d;Xee76a32a6;Xefa99e201;Xf1771d546;Xf33d97589;Xf72d41a32;Xf7f6933ce;Xf94019228;Xfe1dffdd2,85,Public Domain Rank: Identifying Notable Individuals with the Wisdom of the Crowd,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2180,2014
1441,"The Italian National Scientific Qualification (ASN) was introduced in 2010 as part of a major reform of the national university system. Under the new regulation, the scientific qualification for a specific role (associate or full professor) and field of study is required to apply to a permanent professor position. The ASN is peculiar since it makes use of bibliometric indicators with associated thresholds as one of the parameters used to assess applicants. Overall, more than 59000 applications were submitted, and the results have been made publicly available for a short period of time, including the values of the quantitative indicators for each applicant. The availability of this wealth of information provides an opportunity to draw a fairly detailed picture of a nation-wide evaluation exercise, and to study the impact of the bibliometric indicators on the qualification results. In this paper we provide a first account of the Italian ASN from a quantitative point of view. We show that significant differences exist among scientific disciplines, in particular with respect to the fraction of qualified applicants, that can not be easily explained. Furthermore, we describe some issues related to the definition and use of the bibliometric indicators and thresholds. Our analysis aims at drawing attention to potential problems that should be addressed by decision-makers in future ASN rounds.","Marzolla, Moreno",ArXiv e-prints,X09ff26040;X0e16e69a9;X0e3e97333;X0ef085a9c;X0ff13614d;X11c66426b;X1820760ba;X18f82847d;X1b49bb6fa;X1e17813f0;X227eef248;X2ad333278;X2c7ec24ac;X2cbe92f73;X3762ffac6;X39cfb6849;X39dfe0f6d;X3b5a05ee9;X3ce08e587;X45e6405d9;X4770d29b0;X493ecf1c6;X4a49ac74c;X4b6476189;X4cc003d53;X4e22567f1;X50eb35481;X514dbe4c5;X5405109e7;X57e8b3814;X594955b4b;X5cfd70eda;X6197c8d16;X63b18a4c9;X65cee852a;X66a0282f9;X671be4fb6;X67a531590;X6b2a633e2;X6b46ee068;X6e5173485;X70074cffa;X7188a8017;X722cb4828;X73eb2b969;X74a8df6ca;X74e804183;X75baaf6ac;X761549fff;X76d7e8381;X775e67102;X7ad79e4c0;X7b8857410;X7cbfad0ac;X833da4d3b;X86adc4f32;X8728bf3cc;X8e5e67d24;X9071657af;X90be60e45;X915d97205;X91ff33ccb;X9299d6f42;X956b6c248;X98a1bf26f;X9eaa83908;Xa1b994b71;Xa27d9952b;Xa2f1b1547;Xa783335fd;Xa7a75d8a2;Xaa29ac4fd;Xaab09b27a;Xab01a1fa1;Xace0087a9;Xad45fc34a;Xb4a5ba4de;Xbf5e831fe;Xc01a098b9;Xc306d30f5;Xc31f84bff;Xc6510ac12;Xc9f1fc307;Xcba597ced;Xcd8d4eec3;Xcf997d29d;Xd25589339;Xd4b8ff7e6;Xd4d6c3c67;Xd61e64892;Xdb8a9ff4b;Xdd0744df6;Xdd5f6428d;Xde8e46398;Xded7e3a7c;Xdf226d1eb;Xdfaaf9831;Xe0234198e;Xe2547b2a1;Xe37eae1e4;Xee1757997;Xee4f52ee3;Xf0f8217ac;Xf45e582a1;Xf49a95764;Xf5c52c566;Xf610e2000;Xf89e8e053;Xf8e984446;Xfb2922a4c;Xfbba7847d;Xfc3b8a45b;Xfc8057881,113,Quantitative Analysis of the Italian National Scientific Qualification,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4081,2014
1442,"Coauthors (CA) of a “lead investigator” (LI) can receive a rank (r) according to their “importance” in having published joint publications with the LI. It is commonly accepted, without any proof, that publications in peer review journals and for example conference proceedings do not have the same “value” in a CV, and the same applies to papers contributing to encyclopedia and book chapters. It is examined here whether the relationship between the number (J) of publications of some scientist with her/his coauthors, ranked according to their decreasing importance, i.e. J∝1/r<SUP>α</SUP>, as found by Ausloos (2013) [1], still holds if the overall publication list is broken into such specific types of publications. Several authors, with different careers, but mainly having worked in the field of statistical mechanics, are studied here to sort out answers to the questions. The exponent α turns out to be weakly scientist dependent, only if the maximum value of J and r is large and is ̃+1 then. The m<SUB>A</SUB> core value, i.e. the core number of CAs, for proceedings only is about half of the total one, i.e. when all publications are counted. Contributions to the numerical values from both encyclopedia and book chapters are marginal. The role of a time span on m<SUB>A</SUB> is also examined in two cases in relation to career activity considerations. It can be considered that the findings serve as a contrasting point of view on how to quantify an individual (publication) career as recently done by Petersen et al. (2010, 2012, 2011) [2-4], here emphasizing the collaboration size and evolution, rather than a citation count, moreover specifying the type of publication.

We analyze the parameterized complexity of maximizing the H-index using article merges. Herein, multiple possible measures for computing the citation count of a merged article are considered. Among others, for the measure used by Google Scholar, we give an algorithm that maximizes the H-index in linear time if there is only a constant number of versions of the same article. In contrast, if we are allowed to merge arbitrary articles, then already increasing the H-index by one is NP-hard.","van Bevern, René;Komusiewicz, Christian;Niedermeier, Rolf;Sorge, Manuel;Walsh, Toby",ArXiv e-prints,X01e0877aa;X03d304d55;X06f5f2007;X0c21900ec;X130660fd3;X1f6e9162f;X1f6f97284;X201e8828d;X2139dd952;X22c239297;X28892efaf;X2a5162a19;X2ebf5ef6c;X315c8fff3;X346db4a92;X3475a0dbd;X3cf593b89;X3d82e7e5d;X4014c1b40;X413887587;X42d92f90e;X43844e3eb;X459e9e7cd;X45e28903e;X499005669;X519289c37;X534983c73;X54477d2c0;X558629c02;X55cb5a94c;X565e1b64a;X58a569a20;X5c55a6ff8;X5c8fa2b8c;X63fad936d;X677ccbdc8;X69c156ccf;X6d2928a0b;X6df1d51dd;X6fa11531a;X796aec832;X802e2e32c;X8396b9b91;X84c70c779;X86703dc27;X899b6d40a;X9176a2678;X91eee2bf0;X98b11f666;X9a5f65381;Xa0a57ea6b;Xa1bd372c7;Xa255002b1;Xa5d0b9018;Xa71b6c120;Xaaded4576;Xac59e5c94;Xaf1ce0eda;Xb109298b5;Xb1c53cd5a;Xb345b00bb;Xb5921b97f;Xba1c0932d;Xbd2cbe5d2;Xc0e32dba0;Xc21d4089b;Xceb661763;Xd1e0d478b;Xd492b845b;Xd6911e3ef;Xd7a161f2e;Xd8c9a4453;Xd8e1edb44;Xdcc6da61b;Xdf9f268bd;Xe1b1c61e7;Xe6b15557e;Xec8e9f5ce;Xed76dcd80;Xf0d8085f8;Xf3c89473a;Xf5c52c566;Xf61edeace;Xfa38df7f1;Xfdd0b5d41;Xffad64a68,86,On Google Scholar H-Index Manipulation by Merging Articles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5498,2014
1444,"Scientific impact plays a central role in the evaluation of the output of scholars, departments, and institutions. A widely used measure of scientific impact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predicting the number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of such predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law distribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are extremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare. Given this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked by many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: ""Will this paper increase my h-index?"" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7 million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from the premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific impact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to increase the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authority on the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published are crucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the topic popularity and the co-authors' h-indices are of surprisingly little relevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5% potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's h-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a self-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that it will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current h-index in five years. We conclude that our findings on the quantification of scientific impact can help researchers to expand their influence and more effectively leverage their position of ""standing on the shoulders of giants.""","Dong, Yuxiao;Johnson, Reid A.;Chawla, Nitesh V.",ArXiv e-prints,54ef495ffa;X004b49388;X024b371ab;X048299ba0;X05ff00807;X063a77530;X069133566;X06def833d;X08614c717;X09a018eb4;X0a2ef6795;X0aaff9e42;X0bb577a13;X0c3d21637;X0d538e4c9;X0dc62a67a;X0e68dde9f;X0ec0738ce;X112d2ce18;X116d05174;X127eb5bad;X13198e99a;X143785e46;X162992ec1;X16d0e7a40;X176ce7a19;X188839e99;X1905e41c3;X190bd685d;X1a842f660;X1aa857b6a;X1ae2c2d8a;X1af9ff895;X1f721bb30;X204f6a7ee;X20ed32b52;X212bcceed;X224bac08e;X233dcf928;X2347d0854;X23db33252;X2517a7ae7;X253925ad6;X2549ac092;X258f767fa;X2876197f2;X2b7ae0457;X2cc133541;X2e474f4bb;X2eb524cdd;X2f5827ff4;X2fad39656;X30cd2689b;X30e61b941;X3111f3f58;X313834264;X33b9db232;X34af13003;X34be40a16;X34e78bf4e;X3539442ec;X35f15419e;X36dea413b;X38662ba64;X39a8c8503;X3a13bda4c;X3a84fdef6;X3aa1fab1b;X3aacee174;X3d3e4d160;X3d843a54e;X405a2ba2a;X4289cb23b;X448696bd0;X466dab96f;X46810a415;X46fe49e83;X483a0cf42;X48a3aaa9b;X4a1a5df9f;X4b94a8f4d;X4e0d875e2;X4e8e18df2;X4ffea7063;X512dc8a44;X525121bcb;X530b4cf2d;X5684a3af4;X584ae11a7;X586b7d81b;X58cc9e2ee;X597841be7;X5a3cc87b5;X5b37029c0;X5d4520cd0;X5d48421c3;X5e85b661c;X5e96f0c3d;X5e9b27f31;X5eadd0911;X5ecfaa3cb;X5eedaa01a;X60c81b539;X61119f0a7;X6270efe53;X632ef12b8;X6332149a2;X641e73930;X6461d25b2;X653e22348;X658c12ed5;X67239bdad;X69d711b28;X6c173a8c6;X6d5ff9ebb;X6d7c83dd3;X6f5ef8d45;X71d89e4ad;X71e3e23fb;X721a3fd3d;X729471620;X734efa0f3;X753817f28;X7575d2fc3;X7580de685;X77dc9c0c5;X77eed6782;X787c0a44b;X7abe9d68f;X7b4f04860;X7cbbfefe6;X7dc4bc637;X7eb538719;X80228ca2a;X8448112a1;X8582a301b;X865956352;X86b5a878a;X8717b3d65;X877d4473c;X87a23018f;X8b34e35e1;X8c9854f45;X8d3934b5a;X903033e51;X90b794246;X9319557ba;X95cd4be3a;X98642332f;X98d8b3578;X9c32973d3;X9c505a4cf;X9ca29edbd;X9d7a7d049;X9db76eba3;X9db9cea94;X9e33be8d9;X9ee79e134;X9f75c6f1f;Xa02ec0c88;Xa0ae508de;Xa0d041ee6;Xa2bd6892e;Xa2ed1c9e4;Xa439687cd;Xa45966e2c;Xa59dd3907;Xa84c1f7da;Xa8f8ba34c;Xa91731636;Xaa6720edb;Xaab77e6dd;Xab1951685;Xac9f68028;Xae64c797e;Xaedb2cc85;Xaf95f0a06;Xb002e0e6e;Xb0496d156;Xb089dd549;Xb4f80bf74;Xb5327fe3b;Xb60e25f08;Xb64ee4e8d;Xb65f0edf7;Xb79a05e71;Xb7af58e2a;Xb82c7b6c6;Xb8f115765;Xbbafc83f2;Xbbd207dfc;Xbdcfbabe2;Xbe98cd561;Xbf21bdb6d;Xbfb22383b;Xbfdecf065;Xc08434d57;Xc30559d02;Xc503ae917;Xc91c30946;Xc9886c784;Xcad8416c4;Xcb798ab25;Xcd249a950;Xceb0f9a1e;Xcf73b78db;Xd21e64cde;Xd293b5b74;Xd40c6914c;Xd43f48b07;Xd4681b490;Xd4c8484df;Xd50869bf4;Xd59511732;Xd5cad8f4d;Xd63616413;Xd7d3213d0;Xd9117d247;Xdad6086b8;Xdcaae5ca4;Xdcaf6b5e7;Xdd61fb4af;Xdfbf19dd1;Xe02f2e6c9;Xe2863d527;Xe28d3c501;Xe3bf2db2a;Xe3ee793a0;Xe3f0ceb62;Xe44995332;Xe623d7ecc;Xe6474836b;Xe8c7baca1;Xe9fe7121d;Xeb88b30b1;Xec02a9f7d;Xecd710681;Xed077e14f;Xf1d80115f;Xf39dc0221;Xf3b7ff4f8;Xf45e40021;Xf53b972de;Xf71634556;Xf824f7d0f;Xf8ab5f8c5;Xfcbcecec8;Xfd22db302;Xfe0dcd017;Xfe9d1a76b;Xff1f1e6aa;Xffa157c4c,252,Will This Paper Increase Your h-index?

1445,"An analysis of 2,765 articles published in four math journals from 1997 to 2005 indicate that articles deposited in the arXiv received 35% more citations on average than non-deposited articles (an advantage of about 1.1 citations per article), and that this difference was most pronounced for highly-cited articles. Open Access, Early View, and Quality Differential were examined as three non-exclusive postulates for explaining the citation advantage. There was little support for a universal Open Access explanation, and no empirical support for Early View. There was some inferential support for a Quality Differential brought about by more highly-citable articles being deposited in the arXiv. In spite of their citation advantage, arXiv-deposited articles received 23% fewer downloads from the publisher's website (about 10 fewer downloads per article) in all but the most recent two years after publication. The data suggest that arXiv and the publisher's website may be fulfilling distinct functional needs of the reader.","Davis, Philip M.;Fromerth, Michael J.",Scientometrics,545be254e2;5547e22796;X0093af2dd;X01c2bf2b3;X02a548b6c;X02a7caac4;X0304b36d4;X040d64704;X04a9986e4;X07c20c0b2;X07cf70897;X0f929d743;X119683aca;X120139485;X178dd6f76;X183d7d0a8;X19acb4198;X1b0a294e2;X23b81a2d4;X25d092727;X2717274f4;X29079acca;X29e025ab4;X2abb24e41;X2baf55aeb;X2ef8a4546;X3152e7afc;X315cb814c;X3209abc15;X32be5be3e;X34a16a953;X37206498f;X39e72362e;X39ee58c76;X3a010bef6;X3da6d53b9;X400e069fc;X480be5136;X4b5bcde2d;X4c1b6d5d2;X4c3dd0daa;X4d7da8ae0;X4dfb511c5;X5095ef3e9;X527d043c7;X545a66243;X584c50b14;X5d2f1264f;X60726ea76;X60960db69;X6308e8e40;X63b18899f;X64d4f135e;X65558e194;X66884c4a6;X6b5393307;X6d466c03d;X6d81173ca;X6da7bfdbe;X6ea0208c4;X71b1b2d26;X734bbb6a8;X743e3b310;X74c43a30b;X77ecb5d79;X79239b5ed;X7a16f6ae9;X7dc96559c;X7ed5f2f8f;X817ae6fc3;X8249adb30;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X8b402a927;X8cd17292f;X8d9f61b23;X8f64517bf;X90fabe420;X943904586;X9554ca1e3;X95bdf1a64;X98ac1c9fd;X9920261d7;X9b9ec0683;Xa17b321e8;Xa418d1dc6;Xa6e5e4033;Xa751403a2;Xafe1ea12b;Xb1875d7bd;Xb257c27b8;Xb37251245;Xb7108494e;Xba45b29c6;Xba9e90876;Xbbafc83f2;Xbd5942077;Xc1a3d0ff6;Xc217ba3d8;Xcaa0da886;Xcaa949ce2;Xcc33976ab;Xcd1c4d433;Xd54acce0b;Xd74122726;Xd7f47a6a9;Xd8130bcac;Xdcddecee1;Xe0372d184;Xe278bbad6;Xe4b37a71b;Xe655dc7c2;Xea0c1a83b;Xec54caf1b;Xf073b652b;Xf3b223276;Xf404c5b74;Xf6bf186db;Xf9e718125;Xfa77c9a50;Xfca73dc6f;Xfcbadb853;Xfed0ddf49;Xff195b215;Xff63f6635;Xff7dbb75e,126,Does the arXiv lead to higher citations and reduced publisher downloads for mathematics articles?,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0603056,2007
1446,"In this paper, I present the evaluation of a novel knowledge domain visualization (KDViz) of educational technology. The interactive visualization is based on readership patterns in the online reference management system Mendeley. It comprises of 13 topic areas, spanning psychological, pedagogical, and methodological foundations, learning methods and technologies, and social and technological developments in educational technology. The visualization was evaluated with (1) a qualitative comparison to knowledge domain visualizations based on citations, and (2) expert interviews. The results show that the co-readership visualization has similarities to recent knowledge domain visualizations based on citations, but that it is a more up-to-date representation of the field. It also showed that a broad range of research areas are covered, but that areas related to computer science are missing. Finally, even though the visualization is easy to use and understand, more research is needed to explore the interpretations of size and placement of research areas in the visualization.","Kraker, Peter",ArXiv e-prints,X006b55b39;X015da91e1;X0954e8445;X0b24e6167;X16769de4d;X1917f6fca;X1b428b7a5;X1b859212f;X1df684aef;X1e4e65c66;X21e51d306;X2496c9785;X259a7fbc6;X27169a8cb;X384daf670;X39431570f;X3aa1433d3;X40155acb2;X47a1586a8;X4da2ac7e8;X501758f88;X53daf67b1;X5c8fa2b8c;X5dadada5f;X5dd1d02b4;X639afe8fb;X6fa22523e;X777d9b03c;X7d3f03970;X8e9bcfa5c;X938c06b6c;X9801a870c;X9a60c3a7d;X9ff799eaf;Xa1b994b71;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xab02f4e88;Xadd198cdc;Xadd704ea2;Xb12414fe5;Xbd74722d2;Xc4171bf8b;Xc6c1553a6;Xcc80d5a2a;Xcddea854a;Xce9ef9ca6;Xd5e0aa6e3;Xd9cd1a027;Xdd76f227f;Xdfea39719;Xe1e8e4626;Xed87f4270;Xf7273e283;Xf969c2779;Xfe0a568a0,55,Educational Technology as Seen Through the Eyes of the Readers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6462,2014
1447,"The ""event"" concept appears repeatedly when developing metadata models for the description and management of multimedia content. During the typical life cycle of multimedia content, events occur at many different levels - from the events which happen during content creation (directing, acting, camera panning and zooming) to the events which happen to the physical form (acquisition, relocation, damage of film or video) to the digital conversion, reformatting, editing and repackaging events, to the events which are depicted in the actual content (political, news, sporting) to the usage, ownership and copyright agreement events and even the metadata attribution events. Support is required within both MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 for the clear and unambiguous description of all of these event types which may occur at widely different levels of nesting and granularity. In this paper we first describe an event-aware model (the ABC model) which is capable of modeling and yet clearly differentiating between all of these, often recursive and overlapping events. We then illustrate how this model can be used as the foundation to facilitate semantic interoperability between MPEG-7 and MPEG-21. By expressing the semantics of both MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 metadata terms in RDF Schema (and some DAML+OIL extensions) and attaching the MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 class and property hierarchies to the appropriate top-level classes and properties of the ABC model, we are essentially able to define a single distributed machine-understandable ontology, which will enable interoperability of data and services across the entire multimedia content delivery chain.","Hunter, Jane",ArXiv e-prints,X13d9ddb12;X2bef9f45b;X2c6001f53;X4f6db59d2;X513dda04b;X65001129b;X7fbb6c2fd;X872f10940;X87a9fcff9;X8ea243715;X97959b3a0;Xb13f9da14;Xb32cdc5fd;Xc85b763ee;Xdeb8282b8;Xe1b05e7f4;Xeba9d7949,17,Reconciling MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 Semantics through a Common Event-Aware Metadata Model,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0210021,2002

1449,"There is increasing interest among funding agencies to understand how they can best contribute to enhancing the socio-economic impact of research. Interdisciplinarity is often presented as a research mode that can facilitate impact but there exist a limited number of analytical studies that have attempted to examine whether or how interdisciplinarity can affect the societal relevance of research. We investigate fifteen Social Sciences research investments in the UK to examine how they have achieved impact. We analyse research drivers, cognitive distances, degree of integration, collaborative practices, stakeholder engagement and the type of impact generated. The analysis suggests that interdisciplinarity cannot be associated with a single type of impact mechanism. Also, interdisciplinarity is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for achieving societal relevance and impact. However, we identify a specific modality -- ""long-range"" interdisciplinarity, which appears more likely to be associated with societal impact because of its focused problem-orientation and its strong interaction with stakeholders.","Molas-Gallart, Jordi;Tang, Puay;Rafols, Ismael",ArXiv e-prints,X11d90d7eb;X1a9d32e72;X1f2011649;X23da3f73c;X2b5995646;X4709aa7a6;X4ae50d9d0;X62186bf98;X64930bc48;X7ca0fe46f;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa248d99b8;Xb1c559b98;Xb2338d388;Xbd24df3fe;Xcbe8c0cff;Xccaf045da;Xe7aaf5f7c;Xed8248ba3;Xef6c5f02a;Xf593cd5f7,22,On the relationship between interdisciplinarity and impact: different modalities of interdisciplinarity lead to different types of impact,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6684,2014

1451,"F1000 recommendations have been validated as a potential data source for research evaluation, but reasons for differences between F1000 Article Factor (FFa scores) and citations remain to be explored. By linking 28254 publications in F1000 to citations in Scopus, we investigated the effect of research level and article type on the internal consistency of assessments based on citations and FFa scores. It turns out that research level has little impact, while article type has big effect on the differences. These two measures are significantly different for two groups: non-primary research or evidence-based research publications are more highly cited rather than highly recommended, however, translational research or transformative research publications are more highly recommended by faculty members but gather relatively lower citations. This can be expected because citation activities are usually practiced by academic authors while the potential for scientific revolutions and the suitability for clinical practice of an article should be investigated from the practitioners' points of view. We conclude with a policy relevant recommendation that the application of bibliometric approaches in research evaluation procedures should include the proportion of three types of publications: evidence-based research, transformative research, and translational research. The latter two types are more suitable to be assessed through peer review.","Du, Jian;Tang, Xiaoli;Wu, Yishan",ArXiv e-prints,54d5619e4c;54d98daabc;54ece3cd3a;X09e694bcf;X0b559beb5;X197e13ef2;X23fbdf352;X2a9e5e6c9;X34110efab;X35e0dbf71;X37824a08c;X3fac2fb47;X405c05822;X4c6c36dc9;X58e51a7d6;X597fc42b5;X67f41973e;X69d339ba9;X6a489ec16;X75aebb6c3;X76fde89e2;X779e6df21;X8571ef23e;X86d12d013;X8838bd00b;X8b92d8f10;X8d8539fbd;X91f39628b;X96d20a99d;X99e19ea95;X9d95a0899;Xa04156e50;Xba88f1f44;Xc18690c03;Xc433d6f75;Xd2eb8ba53;Xd93376029;Xdea020f9a;Xe1f03eaa1;Xe4dfaed91;Xed564d49a;Xf04865a83;Xf04c76fcb;Xf70a591d6,44,The Effects of Research Level and Article Type on the Differences between Citation Metrics and F1000 Recommendations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01076,2015
1452,"Evaluating and comparing the academic performance of a journal, a researcher or a single paper has long remained a critical, necessary but also controversial issue. Most of existing metrics invalidate comparison across different fields of science or even between different types of papers in the same field. This paper proposes a new metric, called return on citation (ROC), which is simply a citation ratio but applies to evaluating the paper, the journal and the researcher in a consistent way, allowing comparison across different fields of science and between different types of papers and discouraging unnecessary and coercive/self-citation.","Li, Tiancheng",ArXiv e-prints,X077ab6826;X32e22b3f7;X3be8ef685;X48ad0e866;X5bfc29d08;X6169a9fd0;X630a3f399;X66264eb84;X6ab9164c5;X6c74a1aa2;X73e3d5574;X88c809e2c;X9757ae97c;X97f0691d9;X98d9ac1b3;X9ac3c6ae0;Xa79e2216d;Xa7a75d8a2;Xa8f8ba34c;Xab8eda9b7;Xabdcc3259;Xbb41bba1d;Xd4d86b78d;Xd7c85a390;Xd97f3ac7d;Xd9b7540e1;Xdab8e5d33;Xdc2619b8c;Xdcce0fd9a;Xdd56f2f13;Xeacb32b32;Xf11cd6715;Xf23426b99;Xfa3356dc1;Xfe8f31144,35,"Return on citation: a consistent metric to evaluate papers, journals and researchers",http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8420,2014
1453,"In materials sciences, a large amount of research data is generated through a broad spectrum of different experiments. As of today, experimental research data including meta-data in materials science is often stored decentralized by the researcher(s) conducting the experiments without generally accepted standards on what and how to store data. The conducted research and experiments often involve a considerable investment from public funding agencies that desire the results to be made available in order to increase their impact. In order to achieve the goal of citable and (openly) accessible materials science experimental research data in the future, not only an adequate infrastructure needs to be established but the question of how to measure the quality of the experimental research data also to be addressed. In this publication, the authors identify requirements and challenges towards a systematic methodology to measure experimental research data quality prior to publication and derive different approaches on that basis. These methods are critically discussed and assessed by their contribution and limitations towards the set goals. Concluding, a combination of selected methods is presented as a systematic, functional and practical quality measurement and assurance approach for experimental research data in materials science with the goal of supporting the accessibility and dissemination of existing data sets.","Wuest, Thorsten;Tinscher, Rainer;Porzel, Robert;Thoben, Klaus-Dieter",ArXiv e-prints,54f8ac89f1;5527868f9f;X0e8500fc3;X13d9c8d9d;X1979658c6;X50432ad3e;X51b4d754f;X5236bc92b;X528b20b19;X54d56b44b;X563ae852e;X573bdceef;X5b91e934a;X5bbe7c2fa;X5c4dc5d4e;X7f4aef04f;X8081fe891;Xa221d8621;Xaa3f79910;Xad1cc1556;Xafeeaee00;Xbcbe4d1dd;Xbda8ea6d2;Xbf44e24a7;Xcab677ad6;Xd13ec9070;Xd24eb1037;Xd280b9f09;Xd4d76a830;Xd713db73e;Xdd043bf8d;Xdf236dbc2;Xe0755b971;Xe132f3167;Xe18c97e70;Xe24abb6d4;Xe47cab5e3;Xe59ed754d;Xeab121aaf;Xecd0d351c;Xf3c07a298;Xf6c77a53e,42,Experimental Research Data Quality In Materials Science,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01149,2015
1454,"The systematic study of ancient texts including their production, transmission and interpretation is greatly aided by the digital methods that started taking off in the 1970s. But how is that research in turn transmitted to new generations of researchers? We tell a story of Bible and computer across the decades and then point out the current challenges: (1) finding a stable data representation for changing methods of computation; (2) sharing results in inter- and intra-disciplinary ways, for reproducibility and cross-fertilization. We report recent developments in meeting these challenges. The scene is the text database of the Hebrew Bible, constructed by the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer (ETCBC), which is still growing in detail and sophistication. We show how a subtle mix of computational ingredients enable scholars to research the transmission and interpretation of the Hebrew Bible in new ways: (1) a standard data format, Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF); (2) the methods of scientific computing, made accessible by (interactive) Python and its associated ecosystem. Additionally, we show how these efforts have culminated in the construction of a new, publicly accessible search engine SHEBANQ, where the text of the Hebrew Bible and its underlying data can be queried in a simple, yet powerful query language MQL, and where those queries can be saved and shared.","Roorda, Dirk",ArXiv e-prints,51b5a10d44;54f93379d0;X01660fe2a;X02c4421e2;X049ee15ad;X04dcc3f19;X0506e7dc7;X07a2c9cf1;X084e43928;X09e641e39;X0a3815450;X0b559beb5;X0ba256843;X0ba35a586;X0bfa41ea3;X0dcb153d0;X0eea4af37;X15f3470f3;X1726eb6c4;X175a10cf2;X1763639ee;X181af1b77;X1835162e4;X1d90e9973;X1f221073b;X2061de515;X22c6a9e5c;X28eeeba57;X2c2bc0dfa;X2d22a3317;X2d6f86488;X2e109fc93;X30929077c;X3d8b9caec;X3e75f3562;X412468e79;X4200b0303;X4362cb1ae;X463fc06bf;X481ea290f;X48882f569;X48ad4dca4;X4de8e931a;X52e15c597;X535aaab58;X540fb41b0;X5464536df;X556210536;X5570a44be;X567bad33d;X575f2f713;X5e5cc5c87;X5f4fc3ba4;X631872d1f;X63b918fea;X63d700c37;X67f79365a;X69074baa8;X70c3f5f83;X7526bd6fd;X77a26cb05;X77b19a69e;X7b2e68755;X7b936a275;X7c65ebb61;X7e41bc5d8;X7e9235f7e;X81ac338ae;X82bd6b8c7;X82e5cf521;X85168f591;X85e947348;X8865b0388;X888fc5ef7;X88f575e9d;X8aeaa08f2;X8b7e6bfd6;X8c286f498;X8c3623705;X8de3c4afb;X8fc9f4b69;X935bb44a6;X954409ae7;X95beceb6a;X980bf84b4;X98ba8c505;X9bd3157c7;X9bf46026b;X9d42f16ad;X9fe75d395;Xa0192b9f6;Xa7dee41be;Xa8fb27944;Xa9f0cb126;Xab3b57e27;Xac0392981;Xac95713f8;Xaca68fd1a;Xadca11e82;Xae3823244;Xb275c8e10;Xb44e9ff52;Xb51a36f3f;Xb562f4969;Xb5c18f647;Xb71074f55;Xbc1c1fecf;Xbe040c956;Xbe9ad9209;Xc0e33de29;Xc1185dc3f;Xc20970cf9;Xc332bb581;Xc53184939;Xc9461ca61;Xc95d2bef0;Xca587cb15;Xcafa32198;Xcb284773b;Xcd84cf60c;Xcdb420328;Xcdb9dca63;Xcf2c503f0;Xd0692a3ab;Xd2699eb49;Xd385d10b8;Xd435c7387;Xd460fbf18;Xd5388b07f;Xdf66acc4f;Xdfdf6a638;Xe132f3167;Xe2a7cc2ac;Xe395112c3;Xe3dc3e768;Xe43a9c9b1;Xe4a4baf1e;Xe4c30be7d;Xe5dd60708;Xe6a9792c9;Xe793a498f;Xe84ebd086;Xe918b766f;Xe989c79a6;Xee5301dac;Xee6b12d42;Xf40be71c6;Xf56ac2c44;Xf8a21089d;Xf8a9b61d5;Xfbe36e8eb;Xfc976c0a5;Xffc814110,153,The Hebrew Bible as Data: Laboratory - Sharing - Experiences,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01866,2015

1458,"As the number of people who use scientific literature databases grows, the demand for literature retrieval services has been steadily increased. One of the most popular retrieval services is to find a set of papers similar to the paper under consideration, which requires a measure that computes similarities between papers. Scientific literature databases exhibit two interesting characteristics that are different from general databases. First, the papers cited by old papers are often not included in the database due to technical and economic reasons. Second, since a paper references the papers published before it, few papers cite recently-published papers. These two characteristics cause all existing similarity measures to fail in at least one of the following cases: (1) measuring the similarity between old, but similar papers, (2) measuring the similarity between recent, but similar papers, and (3) measuring the similarity between two similar papers: one old, the other recent. In this paper, we propose a new link-based similarity measure called C-Rank, which uses both in-link and out-link by disregarding the direction of references. In addition, we discuss the most suitable normalization method for scientific literature databases and propose an evaluation method for measuring the accuracy of similarity measures. We have used a database with real-world papers from DBLP and their reference information crawled from Libra for experiments and compared the performance of C-Rank with those of existing similarity measures. Experimental results show that C-Rank achieves a higher accuracy than existing similarity measures.","Yoon, Seok-Ho;Kim, Sang-Wook;Park, Sunju",ArXiv e-prints,X023b98511;X0a0171688;X27f010b90;X36a4902c7;X6053a2102;X61078239e;X67f1cff07;X6cef4d3d9;X6e7a93ee6;X7b4f7baaf;X7fba05528;X901c40715;X951b8399b;X9717a3f07;X9978c84a3;Xb60bfcdd2;Xc13331a39;Xced70e1c5;Xd756c2e0b;Xdb86e0f91;Xe5f86a3ab;Xf36260e9f,22,C-Rank: A Link-based Similarity Measure for Scientific Literature Databases,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1059,2011
1459,"Data compression algorithms change frequently, and obsolete decoders do not always run on new hardware and operating systems, threatening the long-term usability of content archived using those algorithms. Re-encoding content into new formats is cumbersome, and highly undesirable when lossy compression is involved. Processor architectures, in contrast, have remained comparatively stable over recent decades. VXA, an archival storage system designed around this observation, archives executable decoders along with the encoded content it stores. VXA decoders run in a specialized virtual machine that implements an OS-independent execution environment based on the standard x86 architecture. The VXA virtual machine strictly limits access to host system services, making decoders safe to run even if an archive contains malicious code. VXA's adoption of a ""native"" processor architecture instead of type-safe language technology allows reuse of existing ""hand-optimized"" decoders in C and assembly language, and permits decoders access to performance-enhancing architecture features such as vector processing instructions. The performance cost of VXA's virtualization is typically less than 15% compared with the same decoders running natively. The storage cost of archived decoders, typically 30-130KB each, can be amortized across many archived files sharing the same compression method.","Ford, Bryan",ArXiv e-prints,X5a8dba4d9;Xa07f346d8;Xc7c15b7e2;Xf3ad13206;Xfbcd97558,5,VXA: A Virtual Architecture for Durable Compressed Archives,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0603073,2006
1460,"Bibliometric studies often rely on field-normalized citation impact indicators in order to make comparisons between scientific fields. We discuss the connection between field normalization and the choice of a counting method for handling publications with multiple co-authors. Our focus is on the choice between full counting and fractional counting. Based on an extensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we argue that properly field-normalized results cannot be obtained when full counting is used. Fractional counting does provide results that are properly field normalized. We therefore recommend the use of fractional counting in bibliometric studies that require field normalization, especially in studies at the level of countries and research organizations. We also compare different variants of fractional counting. In general, it seems best to use either the author-level or the address-level variant of fractional counting.","Waltman, Ludo;van Eck, Nees Jan",ArXiv e-prints,53a4377218;X0b559beb5;X0d59cf082;X10a1d5a18;X16d60a863;X195fcec2e;X2379c9977;X27a8dc5c3;X29b00f4ac;X2b70e1bf4;X2ba0c7cad;X3996927a8;X3c017b7a6;X3d0492c2d;X442b2376d;X4dc9e4f1a;X58b1a6749;X6520d43bd;X66a4accbd;X78a913ab2;X78dca00ea;X7d1d15d94;X7ddeb69e3;X852b531f3;X8e9bcfa5c;X8f301427d;X9318853a7;X94ba7afb2;Xa12e66f64;Xa1b994b71;Xa2fdeb5c4;Xa891a6853;Xaae02fac5;Xad8637bfc;Xb207c6ed4;Xb3b736d73;Xbe433b181;Xc86b233c2;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xcb7133bf4;Xcbf99df89;Xcd3faccb3;Xcde554246;Xcefac67da;Xcf000300c;Xd0845a457;Xd31efd5a9;Xec2493e91;Xeef68815a;Xf04865a83,50,Field-normalized citation impact indicators and the choice of an appropriate counting method,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04431,2015
1461,"This workshop brings together experts of communities which often have been perceived as different once: bibliometrics / scientometrics / informetrics on the one side and information retrieval on the other. Our motivation as organizers of the workshop started from the observation that main discourses in both fields are different, that communities are only partly overlapping and from the belief that a knowledge transfer would be profitable for both sides. Bibliometric techniques are not yet widely used to enhance retrieval processes in digital libraries, although they offer value-added effects for users. On the other side, more and more information professionals, working in libraries and archives are confronted with applying bibliometric techniques in their services. This way knowledge exchange becomes more urgent. The first workshop set the research agenda, by introducing in each other methods, reporting about current research problems and brainstorming about common interests. This follow-up workshop continues the overall communication, but also puts one problem into the focus. In particular, we will explore how statistical modelling of scholarship can improve retrieval services for specific communities, as well as for large, cross-domain collections like Mendeley or ResearchGate. This second BIR workshop continues to raise awareness of the missing link between Information Retrieval (IR) and bibliometrics and contributes to create a common ground for the incorporation of bibliometric-enhanced services into retrieval at the scholarly search engine interface.","Mayr, Philipp;Frommholz, Ingo;Scharnhorst, Andrea;Mutschke, Peter",ArXiv e-prints,5531b98269;X033f47262;X0b559beb5;X0d74db05f;X1ae20b794;X2630d2ff2;X29b00f4ac;X413faa55f;X4713e8f04;X4e12fb83d;X5891891ba;X5f3da438b;X6d9d29f11;X6eb2e1e7e;X73f4a0f7e;X7668464ed;X8f8c04692;X9317fc1ff;X945eb79da;X945fc013b;X98c0b4a1f;X9c779a82c;X9dfc983e9;Xb569e8737;Xb6680da03;Xca4874172;Xd147ef247;Xd7df80740;Xdb9fb7e74;Xdc9a5a5d9;Xdf2047cd9;Xdf2c9211c;Xf04865a83;Xf417a70c4,34,Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval: 2nd International BIR Workshop,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02646,2015
1462,"Evaluating the performance of researchers and measuring the impact of papers written by scientists is the main objective of citation analysis. Various indices and metrics have been proposed for this. In this paper, we propose a new citation index CITEX, which gives normalized scores to authors and papers to determine their rankings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first citation index which simultaneously assigns scores to both authors and papers. Using these scores, we can get an objective measure of the reputation of an author and the impact of a paper. We model this problem as an iterative computation on a publication graph, whose vertices are authors and papers, and whose edges indicate which author has written which paper. We prove that this iterative computation converges in the limit, by using a powerful theorem from linear algebra. We run this algorithm on several examples, and find that the author and paper scores match closely with what is suggested by our intuition. The algorithm is theoretically sound and runs very fast in practice. We compare this index with several existing metrics and find that CITEX gives far more accurate scores compared to the traditional metrics.","Pal, Arindam;Ruj, Sushmita",ArXiv e-prints,X023c75145;X036625a8f;X0407755a3;X0477ca6e3;X04dd1993c;X05a2257af;X05a8a5d10;X060b02504;X06161927a;X06f506183;X075926efe;X07dd26303;X084434cc8;X09a018eb4;X09b327491;X0ae701481;X0b30fbadc;X0b559beb5;X0c19e8ed9;X0d74db05f;X0da536dc8;X0efb78f25;X10fdc3095;X1146443a0;X11d90d7eb;X1205c64ff;X127eb5bad;X1376b6435;X144e34f1c;X1620e8bf2;X163d61a42;X17dd7b2db;X19e9d5c56;X1a0380399;X1aa00a8ef;X1cf89f3da;X1d2aec6fa;X1d9688fc1;X1df0f2cb8;X1faf45522;X212c65dc2;X2184e3e88;X21e29ebad;X22682bcc6;X238d6fced;X2539bdbef;X25f2711f0;X26dfc0eac;X281ed1f30;X28750c18f;X2a077f892;X2b937396e;X2baa38366;X2d38d7de6;X2d5ac6208;X2d71c3a69;X2d7333ef5;X2d7d9d257;X2dd1d040e;X2ef7fe3d7;X2f052bcd6;X2fdc84dfd;X30cd2689b;X32e23c073;X347fecb6c;X35de22bfd;X35f031a9a;X360b0002a;X36616ee9a;X37718cf44;X388f6d3a4;X3b41c8d96;X3c3719afa;X3c4ee0d4f;X4134ca08f;X437226199;X446078991;X44f49ae32;X450eb61a3;X45877e8c1;X46c3e56c7;X47d37ebc6;X4879ac23e;X48fd0b3ca;X498db336f;X499ae043f;X4b6476189;X4b718d925;X4dd6f436c;X4ea2c3a90;X4f4f5da14;X5058e57e9;X50b16d1c8;X52cfc8bfd;X538f1a336;X54f74b5e9;X56418ed16;X56b019d11;X5751501ec;X59e1534d3;X5a55d35f2;X5c432735f;X5df17651d;X5e73654c6;X5e8ae6126;X5f5c2bd74;X604906bc0;X60b0dcf15;X60d61f499;X6235fae48;X62709936c;X630e08a0e;X65b7abec0;X65df4d17d;X65e4c9f2d;X6622f1fbc;X693232c11;X69be65931;X6a12b0e36;X6b33729bc;X6b83c70a3;X6bc8a2c58;X6be244944;X6c1030a6a;X6c5d0c883;X6e900e872;X6eb2e1e7e;X6f8a207d9;X6fcec4c91;X7309a609d;X734ada807;X73abc7375;X74285c9a2;X777d9b03c;X78dca00ea;X790d02be3;X7910ef9af;X7a0fd85c2;X7a15c8324;X7ac8bb2ae;X7bffeee73;X7e3c20109;X8286959f5;X8306935ed;X832ad40d7;X834fa2632;X8384c4aee;X8464bc965;X847f3a075;X855e0d5b0;X8571ef23e;X87acf0ce5;X89b324b38;X8b6157898;X8c46bc694;X8cff3cac9;X8d58cff1f;X8df741bd0;X8e3dc5633;X8f9e06482;X8fc8408bc;X909218376;X90a41668b;X913893f46;X9464d3adf;X952c39288;X9587e51f9;X991d076dd;X9a0a0345a;X9a44f4223;X9a60c3a7d;X9c300a457;X9d02aaa76;X9d1be04b9;X9da12951e;X9e6d6ef97;X9ed13b735;X9efbc7266;Xa065a8b14;Xa0a96aea9;Xa0b698b04;Xa14ecef39;Xa1f09a769;Xa20ecb78d;Xa56e9f9c4;Xa636bf8f0;Xa659a8bc4;Xa71b6c120;Xa78f7abdb;Xa7a75d8a2;Xa93c1c576;Xa962a3773;Xa971dbb69;Xaadc1d3cd;Xab2b05b07;Xad069d522;Xada420f8a;Xae9e8d368;Xafcb90239;Xb0dfb20b7;Xb2338d388;Xb26998c8b;Xb687dd025;Xb748500c5;Xb767275b5;Xb7893f259;Xb90ef04b5;Xbbb6ab754;Xbc54022ae;Xbcce1a98d;Xbe531a683;Xbe6c943ae;Xbe7d0df7f;Xbf4779752;Xbf8785735;Xc0342a229;Xc12aa0271;Xc284d5e59;Xc337aa09c;Xc34b61837;Xc5d38e551;Xc8633a2f4;Xcaf3f7ce8;Xcbb860697;Xcbf565cd5;Xccaf045da;Xccc668e15;Xccd88aa61;Xcd2fc0521;Xcdda70b25;Xce1a4b4c0;Xceaec9e73;Xcefac67da;Xcf17b9f95;Xd0f8057d7;Xd2aee4a34;Xd3b1a3098;Xd3f86c2bb;Xd4bd77a15;Xd558e024b;Xd641533c0;Xd753ada3a;Xd846df2a8;Xd87b333a1;Xd8ea2eae9;Xd95a49da2;Xda380f1ea;Xdb2cbd644;Xdcc6da61b;Xdcd46b8ea;Xde0c69f86;Xde5c6db17;Xdf185b6cf;Xdfd3c4fc2;Xe0a324317;Xe20a4eac8;Xe20d585c6;Xe424afdea;Xe5b1182e5;Xe5b27b210;Xe76cc291d;Xe88aa7346;Xe950918c9;Xeb55a3628;Xeb88b30b1;Xeba197444;Xec4ad6846;Xec8e900fe;Xeef046cbf;Xf04865a83;Xf10410679;Xf18b22127;Xf19c90cf8;Xf42cb8482;Xf434ad2c2;Xf4dbcfaca;Xf5674575a;Xf594920dc;Xf69b8547b;Xf73fb4f15;Xf7626990a;Xfb2fd413c;Xfd545238e;Xff7690535,284,CITEX: A new citation index to measure the relative importance of authors and papers in scientific publications,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04894,2015
1463,"There is no escape from the expansion of information, so that structuring and locating meaningful knowledge becomes ever more difficult. The question of how to order our knowledge is as old as the systematic acquisition, circulation, and storage of knowledge. Classification systems have been known since ancient times. On the Internet, one finds both classifications and taxonomies designed by information professionals and folksonomies based on social tagging. Nevertheless, a user navigating through large information spaces is still confronted with a text based search interface and a list of hits as outcome. There is still an obvious gap between a physical encounter with, for example, a librarys collection and browsing its content through an on-line catalogue. This paper starts from the need of digital scholarship for effective knowledge inquiry, revisits traditional ways to support knowledge ordering and information retrieval, and introduces into a newly funded research network where five different communities from all corners of the scientific landscape join forces in a quest for knowledge maps. It can be read as a manifesto for a newly funded specific research network KnoweScape. At the same time it is a general reflection about what one has to take into account when representing structure and evolution of data, information and knowledge and designing instruments to help scholars and others to navigate across the lands and oceans of knowledge.","Scharnhorst, Andrea",ArXiv e-prints,5545212ff3;X00f6dabe7;X014ec5508;X036b01730;X05a8a5d10;X09a018eb4;X0b559beb5;X0cbbb4458;X0d91f5d3d;X15b817b30;X15e816bda;X15f0c021a;X16b91f88c;X181da2610;X197e1cc9e;X1a9ac9af5;X1d90e9973;X22a73d51a;X2494a32a3;X254986bad;X2c0b2859b;X2d821c8f0;X2e15fee02;X2ef7fe3d7;X30e6dd0e4;X3127d050f;X35ad46602;X393087a9e;X39dfe0f6d;X3ada09924;X3d7a244b0;X3f1f569a5;X3f8c22200;X42345df31;X4627e421a;X4941067a7;X49d6477c3;X4fb9b4a26;X52ca9a8e7;X55357198e;X5704ff54d;X571bd8c26;X59591a6aa;X5db747f61;X5f3da438b;X60f98518b;X6233a8754;X623f4239b;X62d7634df;X637cfbd32;X6588e7143;X676f670be;X68c52d4c8;X6b0f48301;X6baf32cea;X6d818bbdb;X6e996bbc9;X6f053cbfc;X70b2c6e4a;X736115efe;X749753c44;X78f3f1285;X79cbc7060;X7c5199ec0;X7d6d6db1b;X7ed3873e4;X80313a20c;X820f87d41;X82690b573;X84a92dce2;X875783253;X8b7d95584;X8e28e18c7;X98fedf29c;X9c322688e;X9c46fdb05;X9d02aaa76;X9ff0a4a55;Xa41b998da;Xa60ea3d3b;Xaaee5c835;Xad7beca0a;Xad7beda32;Xae64c797e;Xb0e3730df;Xb7b920db6;Xba5e2b840;Xbc211a2a6;Xbf8b8c95c;Xc369f5355;Xd5578026b;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdd241fe52;Xdde32300d;Xe20a4eac8;Xe221007e7;Xe30af9d52;Xeb85f2dc7;Xee471164f;Xf23c990e6;Xf65c80d66;Xf6defe198;Xfa7221340;Xfa76ec4aa;Xfba3d1cbb;Xfbd318b0d,106,Walking through a library remotely - Why we need maps for collections and how KnoweScape can help us to make them?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06776,2015
1464,"This study presents an overview of IS&LS thematic trends in Portugal between 2001 and 2012. The results were obtained by means of an analysis, using expeditious qualitative and quantitative techniques, of the bibliographic records of proceedings papers identified during this period. These records were processed using two techniques: a manual subject classification and an automated co-word analysis of the Author-Assigned Keywords. From this we designed cluster and co-occurrence maps, using the VOSviewer and the Pajek software packages. The results indicated an accentuated dynamism in the thematic evolution of this documental corpus, apart from revealing a significant difference among the themes transmitted in nationally and internationally visible production.","Roque de Oliveira, Silvana;Moreira, Catarina;Borbinha, José;Ángeles Zulueta Garcia, María",ArXiv e-prints,X0b078f53a;X0b559beb5;X0b61019ca;X1013def69;X26211021c;X2f615d818;X35e96e3ce;X3c1b64ce4;X446bf53f9;X5ea7bb02b;X6e4b57512;X6f2d146ef;X756d00139;X7b116c5e4;X7c49e99c4;X7f4aef04f;X8571ef23e;X8640c4f9f;X88ac8a0c0;X8e2a91bca;Xb207c6ed4;Xb64c8b095;Xc26f95f1d;Xca15d01df;Xd49c977ae;Xe3add49a8;Xe50c74186;Xe75f350fb;Xf04865a83,29,Thematic Identification of 'Little Science': Trends in Portuguese IS&LS Literature by Controlled Vocabulary and Co-Word Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05138,2015

In this review we consider: the historical development of scientometrics, sources of citation data, citation metrics and the ""laws"" of scientometrics, normalisation, journal impact factors and other journal metrics, visualising and mapping science, evaluation and policy, and future developments.","Mingers, John;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,54e27b8a02;X00aec6d50;X00bd80b2c;X01460a1c7;X02ff7161f;X03852f483;X04f87fb9d;X050ea014e;X056c480cb;X05b0a2da8;X0610b1996;X062bae56e;X06c4b1d7b;X06f3a1db1;X0740421ed;X080050154;X08f8e010e;X092831c64;X0954e8445;X09677d25f;X09a018eb4;X0a7f5f3f7;X0a9fcefe2;X0b559beb5;X0be6bea2b;X0c0217036;X0c54631a5;X0c748bed9;X0d0fdd7d8;X0d74db05f;X10004c913;X101e4bbfa;X10b0b1669;X10c833095;X12528c458;X12f3551e5;X13f9c34a1;X145d58837;X149eef9be;X14c8c7ffe;X1639b05e5;X16687b709;X167253b8b;X1740b086c;X19597036c;X19e9d5c56;X1ae20b794;X1bf18bbb9;X1bfdacf27;X1cbf9cc70;X1e809d30a;X1f956815c;X204920308;X2052e12a4;X20d728419;X21424dfb9;X216c2292b;X2196a6117;X21c602288;X23e2452a4;X24687076b;X258f767fa;X25cd7b360;X260096212;X2712f6371;X28aba4b53;X28cafc39d;X2916cb14e;X29449a843;X29b00f4ac;X2a4b082c3;X2b70e1bf4;X2d4df7f09;X2db3025ae;X2eff79678;X3123bb65d;X319a8c271;X31a7ed611;X33af44e44;X354d11529;X366c502f2;X36a8a4d90;X371fd3695;X3731f6811;X37a6f7cf3;X37fe48d5f;X389678211;X39316e26e;X3a1db4ff7;X3b3864a50;X3b610fdc7;X3c6921b2d;X3c9688f90;X3cab8454b;X3d0f20f64;X3d15c1921;X3d24c8abd;X3d843a54e;X3dbe5f501;X3eaea35d0;X3f2c92e06;X3f5c170c3;X40f5e39ed;X41b3ddf3d;X43e3ca186;X4401b1f98;X44524c5f0;X4476898cd;X44b4bd8e2;X454c11e17;X45877e8c1;X45ffbe319;X482ba637d;X497d66f96;X4986d3080;X4a9f2c7ea;X4ae50d9d0;X4b6476189;X4b6cb1b84;X4b906d55f;X4c72d6f7c;X4c9852a32;X4d062438b;X4e964cbbd;X4f7950104;X51c955483;X51dfae484;X5230e4d6e;X525121bcb;X5278c2ebb;X53348ae52;X537a32e4a;X5512e8506;X55890bf68;X55a7d70c9;X55c34ce94;X56946729a;X5822384cb;X58412c91a;X5841da436;X586acb446;X5b8b512cf;X5c2b927bc;X5c74960f7;X5c8fa2b8c;X5e2d4d7cc;X5eb21252b;X5ff974c5b;X6062d3c46;X607a42853;X6096b295c;X61da8b5b5;X62054aeee;X6219ca39b;X62906b5c6;X630554e7c;X6310b8fdd;X631333826;X632cf746f;X63bf51ef5;X63cfc345b;X644282b2e;X64506d6d7;X652e41e00;X653387078;X65ee73c31;X65f77372c;X68c2f48a6;X68c450bf9;X68ffcb4e5;X6b161e37c;X6b3983509;X6bcff5c84;X6bd47aad7;X6d17c6064;X6d2e95ae9;X6d88be3e1;X6db914324;X6ecee2a58;X6f8a207d9;X701f08843;X7089bdcd5;X71490e16e;X73dbb41b4;X745025ecb;X7504093c9;X75be22eb8;X763d211ef;X765357c4f;X7668464ed;X76fd8a24b;X770a45bf9;X78f3f1285;X7ab007251;X7b9040212;X7d22b821f;X7ea7ab54b;X7f15ba786;X7f4aef04f;X7f8562b19;X80c24325c;X80e641741;X82d6ab9af;X847f22657;X8510fd709;X860df88f1;X869100243;X878f4b02c;X87ae07905;X87cb85486;X87f9dd91c;X8903ad62f;X8a5c32b33;X8a79cf482;X8abf4f699;X8bb3ddf04;X8c01150f8;X8cd17292f;X8ddfcd6b1;X8e0390444;X8e782d681;X91246e7b0;X91c3afcce;X932b75486;X94ba7afb2;X95151d4be;X9529881c9;X957b2f86a;X95df376b3;X96f2e38b3;X989c41dc6;X98b681e3c;X99e14cb4c;X9a73cf5d7;X9aea11f01;X9b56ec233;X9be3ff87e;X9ccc7bde3;X9d8288891;X9d9ec65a2;X9dd570e36;X9e73e6a81;X9ef9a223a;X9f030c9b6;X9ff0a4a55;Xa013b3478;Xa0495e8c2;Xa0809c730;Xa0ef06452;Xa16e19cdd;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa20f7bca9;Xa28427816;Xa290eb37f;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa41fe9725;Xa44f296ac;Xa5ae46019;Xa5e406c73;Xa6bf33243;Xa7501e1f9;Xa7fac5d8e;Xa87ed7a9e;Xa8b81238e;Xaa45a10aa;Xab01a1fa1;Xab9912a64;Xac4793016;Xad4bbecc3;Xad542cd1f;Xadd704ea2;Xaeed32d66;Xaf1b49dde;Xb06aa336d;Xb0b8f4fdb;Xb11bc0a6f;Xb12540d8b;Xb17a2e964;Xb17a42844;Xb1e0c1a22;Xb207c6ed4;Xb266f193b;Xb2fec81f9;Xb36e69d80;Xb4350c992;Xb4f1a77fe;Xb50e05f0b;Xb62452856;Xb748500c5;Xb870a6271;Xb92cb1028;Xba88f2e42;Xbb5734b0a;Xbb8aebf2f;Xbc0bb839a;Xbc3a3eb85;Xbe4e39122;Xbf732241f;Xc01f1cf56;Xc022645f4;Xc0d2974de;Xc17a5414f;Xc2f9474ac;Xc33cc3b80;Xc36573b81;Xc3cc554d0;Xc4cb65049;Xc6b8fa295;Xc6d82030e;Xc723807c1;Xc7d498279;Xc87879b70;Xc962482e1;Xc9c2aac95;Xca249f5e1;Xcaec49376;Xcb9cb447a;Xcc18f8d1d;Xcc4cdaab0;Xcd4589b99;Xd0a69351e;Xd0dbfa579;Xd366bac53;Xd46198fde;Xd4a14a265;Xd4b1706ce;Xd615a5d5e;Xd65f023ce;Xd71b1481d;Xd7c85a390;Xd7e3bf60f;Xd8badb667;Xda55ea0d9;Xdb97468f8;Xdba76e46c;Xdcf01ba70;Xde656614e;Xdf115c007;Xdf226d1eb;Xdf2ac53aa;Xe08a489bd;Xe0e4c1b0a;Xe1e37dc36;Xe36e0d4d1;Xe424afdea;Xe5e6ff4af;Xe6689f716;Xe7494b36c;Xe843c5820;Xe8960466b;Xe8a1ef3b7;Xe8fce2a94;Xe9baeb80c;Xea21f1748;Xeb2ff1704;Xeb71a9bba;Xeba518748;Xec3be214a;Xecee4f8fc;Xecf2e24dc;Xed2d9f84e;Xee3717e9b;Xeef68815a;Xef4c0cf26;Xef4ce0c51;Xf04865a83;Xf1fe34cde;Xf2517d8a2;Xf253f8370;Xf3132c1fc;Xf381e4948;Xf434ad2c2;Xf45f7ec2f;Xf512e8eca;Xf5a83abcf;Xf604ca0de;Xf6b2b54e2;Xf7e01ce2b;Xf830dd2a9;Xf8b755325;Xf8f2a56eb;Xf8fb72f9d;Xf9e12b166;Xfa8675101;Xfdd25c95f;Xff4189165;Xffa157c4c,388,A Review of Theory and Practice in Scientometrics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05462,2015
1466,"The highest level of mathematics has traditionally been seen as a solitary endeavour, to produce a proof for review and acceptance by research peers. Mathematics is now at a remarkable inflexion point, with new technology radically extending the power and limits of individuals. Crowdsourcing pulls together diverse experts to solve problems; symbolic computation tackles huge routine calculations; and computers check proofs too long and complicated for humans to comprehend. Mathematical practice is an emerging interdisciplinary field which draws on philosophy and social science to understand how mathematics is produced. Online mathematical activity provides a novel and rich source of data for empirical investigation of mathematical practice - for example the community question answering system {\it mathoverflow} contains around 40,000 mathematical conversations, and {\it polymath} collaborations provide transcripts of the process of discovering proofs. Our preliminary investigations have demonstrated the importance of ""soft"" aspects such as analogy and creativity, alongside deduction and proof, in the production of mathematics, and have given us new ways to think about the roles of people and machines in creating new mathematical knowledge. We discuss further investigation of these resources and what it might reveal. Crowdsourced mathematical activity is an example of a ""social machine"", a new paradigm, identified by Berners-Lee, for viewing a combination of people and computers as a single problem-solving entity, and the subject of major international research endeavours. We outline a future research agenda for mathematics social machines, a combination of people, computers, and mathematical archives to create and apply mathematics, with the potential to change the way people do mathematics, and to transform the reach, pace, and impact of mathematics research.","Martin, Ursula;Pease, Alison",ArXiv e-prints,X02062d9b4;X04639c799;X0489c5c8c;X049cdfd3d;X087bd5223;X0ded7ba04;X117932b6f;X13e7dfab3;X145ffdbe7;X1562586bb;X1634a44e9;X169fd4243;X1b15b6326;X1e25d4d56;X2271781ab;X23861a034;X267288b22;X2b5511649;X311de9ed1;X31b7645c4;X35bcf89f9;X364053e72;X366f653c9;X373024049;X3940ae78e;X3b1145b70;X3c4fdc607;X3ce3b13e1;X3f8d68db7;X3f9771978;X4203bb49b;X44f7fd612;X451bde949;X463cbef4e;X4b28a8000;X4b47e8c4b;X4db161c98;X4e44c8900;X4eda1a62c;X543fe8b40;X5664ed977;X5779fe253;X582e11fd3;X5945dfa18;X5c3799cb2;X5e2a514fd;X5f1d8ef4f;X614b4e318;X68696d2a7;X6883841da;X68a0651a7;X699edf529;X6d428d29a;X76fb88792;X77091b9a6;X7a8a991e0;X7d65e688b;X7e46ab0ee;X8125d2791;X81f6b4173;X857664b39;X86f2c535c;X88626631e;X8c492e948;X9083c5426;X9383da931;X974cc7028;X997b1228c;X9b2b2bf88;X9c7c60353;X9d317b6ca;Xa17657241;Xa21b8d443;Xa458e1771;Xa4994e537;Xa71eac558;Xa7ec34d3e;Xa83dec7cf;Xa921f119a;Xa9277b220;Xa986ddbdd;Xacb62c18e;Xadbca00ed;Xaefd0661f;Xaf72ee62f;Xaf7592ceb;Xafc78025c;Xb1f7fe933;Xb2337e937;Xb430b3d53;Xb62189bb3;Xbac721e7c;Xbb407122a;Xbb90e21a0;Xbc4ca5cff;Xc3831930b;Xc418478ec;Xc601294ec;Xc8982e0d7;Xc9e59d942;Xca16ca2a1;Xcb942cd4f;Xcc8bd0db7;Xccdb03d9d;Xd20cd8c6d;Xd213d58db;Xd4260c8b9;Xd6ecdc11d;Xd74b8e68f;Xd801b38de;Xd87cd4c3f;Xd9ed8e561;Xdd02e057e;Xdd8ecaa3f;Xe04e620c3;Xe339dfa57;Xe670b5cda;Xe78dc2494;Xe92bf60eb;Xe947b0708;Xea71be543;Xea7f92a33;Xec297f0e2;Xed0e43df5;Xed3462606;Xee2ad87c5;Xee95536e1;Xf3561ce6c;Xf402a9f3d;Xf4c0b85c4;Xf7f0cba6f;Xf82244180;Xf84724df9;Xfca0b5de7,134,"Mathematical practice, crowdsourcing, and social machines",http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0900,2013

1468,Bornmann and Leydesdorff (in press) proposed methods based on Web-of-Science data to identify field-specific excellence in cities where highly-cited papers were published more frequently than can be expected. Top performers in output are cities in which authors are located who publish a number of highly-cited papers that is statistically significantly higher than can be expected for these cities. Using papers published between 1989 and 2009 in information science improvements to the methods of Bornmann and Leydesdorff (in press) are presented and an alternative mapping approach based on the indicator I3 is introduced here. The I3 indicator was introduced by Leydesdorff and Bornmann (in press).,"Bornmann, Lutz;Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,X2cc08a661;X4270f0113;X76121bc62;Xef3ee4da5,4,Which cities' paper output and citation impact are above expectation in information science?

1469,"We present an analysis on data citation practices based on the Data Citation Index from Thomson Reuters. This database launched in 2012 aims to link data sets and data studies with citations received from the rest of their citation indexes. Funding bodies and research organizations are increasingly demanding the need of researchers to make their scientific data available in a reusable and reproducible manner, aiming to maximize the allocation of funding while providing transparency on the scientific process. The DCI harvests citations to research data from papers indexed in the Web of Science. It relies on the information provided by the data repository as data citation practices are inconsistent or inexistent in many cases. The findings of this study show that data citation practices are far from common in most research fields. Some differences have been reported on the way researchers cite data: while in the areas of Science and Engineering and Technology data sets were the most cited, in Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities data studies play a greater role. 88.1 percent of the records have received no citations, but some repositories show very low uncitedness rates. While data citation practices are rare in most fields, they have expanded in disciplines such as Crystallography or Genomics. We conclude by emphasizing the role that the DCI could play in encouraging the consistent, standardized citation of research data - a role that would enhance its value as a means of following the research process from data collection to publication.","Robinson-Garcia, Nicolas;Jiménez-Contreras, Evaristo;Torres-Salinas, Daniel",ArXiv e-prints,X015da91e1;X019187be8;X05a8a5d10;X05deb01f1;X0654b4ce7;X071cfce6d;X07cab5ffd;X08020cd9f;X08537be94;X08e2dea6d;X0954e8445;X09ef0a645;X0ad35f7c7;X0b24e6167;X0b559beb5;X0bb577a13;X0e0a98931;X10a1d5a18;X128b15bf7;X12e415d13;X145b9a62c;X14b889fd0;X1639b05e5;X16b89ee9e;X183cd3279;X1882ec132;X188a73c2f;X18a3cc441;X19420e4e4;X1a87607da;X1b28119af;X1bfdacf27;X1cac70720;X1d9688fc1;X1e1f13867;X206ab1fa2;X21bff4ece;X21c60383c;X21e51d306;X2574e0308;X28db049fa;X2916cb14e;X2b794e6f8;X2c6dd0be9;X2d814771e;X2d9d38e46;X2df97bdd9;X2e16e2f69;X2e6dbbf4d;X2f15d4a4c;X3068d3498;X321afe71a;X32fb82932;X341fdd649;X3481e4b6f;X354db9643;X35c3868db;X3731f6811;X37fe48d5f;X3a43c4350;X3b1b7da7e;X3bbdaf588;X3c8b2edb5;X3d4ba59b4;X42b93129d;X440c66d31;X45877e8c1;X461768986;X475ed5f36;X47d5b0e15;X4879ac23e;X4a1777b46;X4cbae3829;X4e1809577;X50ef8eb2c;X5121f5e67;X51d210228;X51d56bc75;X553edd22a;X55b0f9a42;X56d5a6f02;X587272a24;X589897f15;X5a32fd1f5;X5c29bed77;X5cf5fc891;X5dd25f284;X5e4272229;X5e8ae6126;X5ee5bc627;X5ef21b411;X60bbf3b40;X61d1df7f9;X61ddb7529;X6233a8754;X62409c6a3;X6270efe53;X63f5d8284;X67741f5a0;X67a531590;X68db96647;X699796e87;X6af25b8cf;X6b161e37c;X6b93898d6;X6be9f3a10;X6c173a8c6;X6c74a1aa2;X6df23a048;X6f8a207d9;X701f08843;X721cd4b5d;X722cb4828;X7478c6a43;X7504093c9;X75319ba5d;X755efe0ad;X771e28c65;X777d9b03c;X78f3f1285;X7ad41781e;X7c51ca0b5;X7c57339af;X7c769d71b;X7fa883607;X8088b43c6;X80ab5e4c1;X8664d518d;X866a4b236;X87f9dd91c;X8975d41c5;X899b6d40a;X8b000cb80;X8c98529a6;X8e8236af6;X8f9c84eea;X91ff33ccb;X946d957bd;X94d7c5ee1;X9718b8350;X978955336;X980569ad2;X99bba9d85;X9a4990fbf;X9b480d386;X9c37e08e0;X9cfc4317d;X9d0c16700;X9d0f5b346;X9d1535c66;X9ff0a4a55;Xa10a967ac;Xa1b994b71;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa45d62079;Xa64409751;Xa659a8bc4;Xab9912a64;Xadc5df2f0;Xadd704ea2;Xade35d6d6;Xb05ae371e;Xb214a339a;Xb2db970cc;Xb3653d5b3;Xb4181bed9;Xb42037604;Xb67dce1d1;Xba88f1f44;Xbacb9c3d9;Xbc0844d94;Xbd7e59020;Xbdabe5336;Xbe834b3e4;Xbfbd1ac72;Xc10c7c14c;Xc16683af6;Xc26c91176;Xc337aa09c;Xc52e3d547;Xc58a32ff3;Xc6d6625fd;Xc889b61aa;Xca61a276a;Xca6355b3f;Xcacffa3a0;Xcae784ec4;Xcc85914e9;Xcf17b9f95;Xd00ddc803;Xd18920ae4;Xd1ade00e2;Xd31d9c141;Xd48014924;Xd84d481bc;Xd8d641fd7;Xd997da1bc;Xda80d27d9;Xdc4dca7f9;Xddbc544dd;Xe32a97905;Xe51e869bc;Xe7353cf47;Xe86b961cc;Xe8c050791;Xe97126c4d;Xe9b593208;Xeb6dc24ad;Xeba2b995b;Xf01155cae;Xf0cc407b7;Xf29dae0e8;Xf2b57e38a;Xf52efcf4f;Xf5a83abcf;Xf6081a07e;Xf7787196c;Xf808d0164;Xf886532e8;Xf8b755325;Xfa8877b2d;Xfba3d1cbb;Xfc06cb359;Xfcb0c1ebd;Xfd962b3c9;Xfe0dcd017;Xfe369fb3c;Xfe5ed1784;Xff4189165,229,Analyzing data citation practices according to the Data Citation Index,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06285,2015
1470,"The importance of a research article is routinely measured by counting how many times it has been cited. However, treating all citations with equal weight ignores the wide variety of functions that citations perform. We want to automatically identify the subset of references in a bibliography that have a central academic influence on the citing paper. For this purpose, we examine the effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic influence of a citation. By asking authors to identify the key references in their own work, we created a data set in which citations were labeled according to their academic influence. Using automatic feature selection with supervised machine learning, we found a model for predicting academic influence that achieves good performance on this data set using only four features. The best features, among those we evaluated, were those based on the number of times a reference is mentioned in the body of a citing paper. The performance of these features inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index (the hip-index). Unlike the conventional h-index, it weights citations by how many times a reference is mentioned. According to our experiments, the hip-index is a better indicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index.","Zhu, Xiaodan;Turney, Peter;Lemire, Daniel;Vellino, André",ArXiv e-prints,X0a2149458;X0b559beb5;X0d2500f23;X0d74db05f;X111e59c69;X15d9975ee;X16261ca34;X167b906ba;X1689eab18;X16bf3048d;X174e7000e;X18f8a8060;X1cf89f3da;X1d9688fc1;X259a7fbc6;X25b35efb8;X268541f55;X3870dabbd;X3ccfa890d;X3d5f77ee8;X3d843a54e;X3e7b4987d;X3f9f6f64e;X4265f5690;X455fd7d64;X45877e8c1;X48916c2f4;X4b6476189;X53ffae1cd;X579016ea8;X59f1b34dd;X5e8ae6126;X687c927b4;X6c5d0c883;X6f8a207d9;X6fcec4c91;X775e67102;X78f3f1285;X7b3320ba4;X7ca0fe46f;X7f7a235bb;X8086bd3c9;X812bfa71c;X82d1a498b;X878a9aca7;X899b6d40a;X8a7e910d2;X8c25709b3;X956e78961;X97f0691d9;X9a44f4223;Xa0db24798;Xa19e210b1;Xa1c935133;Xa89f8d0da;Xa8ca76723;Xad66e866e;Xaec8580cf;Xb9d7f7588;Xbe7d0df7f;Xc52682f2f;Xca4e7d475;Xcca6f0e22;Xcdf088e52;Xd0e424382;Xde61babdf;Xe18d48448;Xe5518ec13;Xe6c5caa94;Xeb4e74887;Xeea7f0962;Xf04865a83;Xf2517d8a2;Xf4f646e79;Xf6290725d;Xf88b0355b;Xffb915d57,77,Measuring academic influence: Not all citations are equal,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06587,2015

1474,"Using three years of the Journal Citation Reports (2011, 2012, and 2013), indicators of change are developed involving only changes of more than one standard deviation above average. Two forms of change are distinguished: monotonic increases or decreases of citation intensity (cited or citing) and critical revisions of the a posteriori (2013) prediction in 2012 on the basis of 2011 data. Changes can be studied at the level of journals using the margin totals of entropy production along the row or column vectors, but also at the level of links among groups of journals by importing the transition matrices into network analysis and visualization programs (and using community-finding algorithms). The latter analysis improves on the former by being more fine-grained. Changes are found in the giant component representing the major disciplinary structures; and significant changes at the level of specialties are indicated in 52 components which are mostly on the applied side of the sciences and engineering.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,435fda5ea9;X000789272;X037330c68;X063504b0d;X06fc58507;X07a3b7b8d;X09677d25f;X09a018eb4;X0a31fdf09;X0b559beb5;X0c3ff53d8;X0d1f18a26;X0ee34d1c8;X10b0b1669;X1460fccbf;X1476e47aa;X172add237;X184fc8990;X187076924;X1a87607da;X1ae42bf78;X1fce3e598;X2559565ac;X2a4b082c3;X2b1e26a26;X2b70e1bf4;X2e56e84c9;X2e6dbbf4d;X3181b372c;X320fa5a59;X32ee63179;X35e98ecec;X37718cf44;X396fff408;X3ae57dc49;X3d6c2013a;X3eb05c3ab;X4053828c2;X41097b5af;X41b3ddf3d;X4289968c4;X434a0c77a;X442ec4b12;X4934ca9e5;X4b2fb5165;X4c7744d51;X4eaa93b32;X4f997eb49;X50fe45558;X55a7d70c9;X585fd6173;X5b0bd5413;X5cd658a89;X5d4300873;X5e52917d7;X5e8ae6126;X5ff974c5b;X600b2d93f;X6074ab400;X62acc3a3d;X638b47796;X63cb53045;X64632df8c;X6dbf80f9f;X72114acdf;X724833c7a;X7292aa7a4;X73dcf5649;X750765624;X75667643a;X78dca00ea;X790348895;X79351dc87;X7e6cad377;X7ed9d7f25;X7f6f39dd1;X80fe2650b;X8159b1580;X82690b573;X8320889b8;X88fbf066b;X8a27505cf;X8e9bcfa5c;X90ae98fc9;X937a3501e;X94d96f35a;X961bb3d7a;X966d03917;X96f2e38b3;X98ce470f3;X9aea5fb86;X9b1b58bea;X9c309106e;X9dd570e36;Xa150953f6;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa7163075d;Xab18a8335;Xaee9d3c44;Xb075d6256;Xb149467f0;Xb207c6ed4;Xb2d9bb214;Xb2db970cc;Xb3b5524ed;Xb748500c5;Xb80abbc4f;Xbc023a785;Xbe3d1cbc4;Xbe4e39122;Xc0648cc09;Xc069f6bff;Xc3527824a;Xc369f5355;Xc48857054;Xc4cf90f6e;Xc54df483c;Xc9117f3e6;Xc9251eb0e;Xc98b8fd9d;Xccc70ed72;Xcd6db91f4;Xcddea854a;Xce4af7480;Xcf20ed3e1;Xd04744858;Xd2ad0ecbf;Xd3d040e96;Xd4bd77a15;Xd549431c7;Xd8e1637c8;Xd9b8a0997;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdbf3fd191;Xdc4dca7f9;Xdf226d1eb;Xdf2c9211c;Xe36e0d4d1;Xe414dee28;Xe47525a5f;Xea7909a75;Xef37f56c5;Xf213de7a9;Xf45ce2040;Xf6bf186db;Xf808d0164;Xfe0dcd017;Xfe369fb3c;Xffb559d61,149,"Can ""Hot Spots"" in the Sciences Be Mapped Using the Dynamics of Aggregated Journal-Journal Citation Relations?",http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00229,2015
1475,"Scientific literature till date can be thought of as a partially revealed landscape, where scholars continue to unveil hidden knowledge by exploring novel research topics. How do scholars explore the scientific landscape , i.e., choose research topics to work on? We propose an agent-based model of topic mobility behavior where scholars migrate across research topics on the space of science following different strategies, seeking different utilities. We use this model to study whether strategies widely used in current scientific community can provide a balance between individual scientific success and the efficiency and diversity of the whole academic society. Through extensive simulations, we provide insights into the roles of different strategies, such as choosing topics according to research potential or the popularity. Our model provides a conceptual framework and a computational approach to analyze scholars' behavior and its impact on scientific production. We also discuss how such an agent-based modeling approach can be integrated with big real-world scholarly data.","Ying, Qiu Fang;Venkatramanan, Srinivasan;Chiu, Dah Ming",ArXiv e-prints,54e7db31a6;X0068ccad5;X00ebb84b3;X0294bcbc7;X043cf867a;X05a8a5d10;X06e7c87e4;X06eaf273d;X07717ba53;X07873b163;X082da3d53;X083fdd0ea;X0a31fdf09;X0b559beb5;X0d2500f23;X0e3e01ae7;X0e3fef4d9;X10fdc3095;X1181649e5;X1376b6435;X1424c7c58;X14b889fd0;X15b817b30;X1639b05e5;X1689eab18;X175d2f91d;X19e9d5c56;X1a76fd33b;X1b428b7a5;X1bfdacf27;X1cb24cad6;X1cf89f3da;X1d7ddcb98;X1d9688fc1;X1de03bdcf;X20618defa;X2080fea6f;X20f290015;X210d4914c;X21e51d306;X2281c8d0b;X2368a345e;X2630f904e;X26bbd786f;X27368d127;X27b09a548;X2a6ca0e23;X2b54bcc96;X2b5aed85d;X2b937396e;X2baa38366;X2bb09881e;X2c4720ea7;X2cb99fc09;X2d358f644;X2d5ac6208;X2d7333ef5;X2dd1d040e;X2e8e61370;X2f129532f;X2ff674135;X32725973c;X328cc5779;X32bc3f3aa;X32e23c073;X34110efab;X348041268;X34af13003;X35e98ecec;X39dfe0f6d;X3a01366b1;X3a5bc1741;X3aacee174;X3b290a086;X3b41c8d96;X3bb0c6492;X3c105cbfe;X3ca951354;X3f1f569a5;X4053828c2;X4129fe903;X4146d609f;X41b9064b8;X41f8a2804;X42c28a184;X43e069cc9;X44524c5f0;X45877e8c1;X461768986;X46de5627c;X47d37ebc6;X491d70893;X4934ca9e5;X4ba379d46;X4c2483cc9;X4f5fe19de;X4fa20aa27;X4ff79da36;X50cf0668b;X516648c93;X5188f84ad;X52397d50a;X5249254b7;X5382337ec;X53daf67b1;X54ea05071;X557f541cf;X55b0f9a42;X5688ea65a;X571bd8c26;X57a3201e5;X57cc916d1;X5a55d35f2;X5b21dfcac;X5cb802067;X5dee7d435;X5f3da438b;X62b95973d;X632ed6034;X638b47796;X63fa8e323;X64632df8c;X6556eae11;X6736fdbcc;X68c99257e;X692a56bf3;X69be65931;X6b2c7b750;X6c6984b0a;X6cc9aec21;X6d3036b24;X6dfcaef66;X6e29ab99e;X6f3080f95;X6f8a207d9;X6fcec4c91;X7018422d6;X71e058f71;X722cb4828;X734ada807;X75b2d78c9;X75fa94740;X76421d989;X770faa7ea;X775e67102;X78ccf6572;X78dca00ea;X78f3f1285;X795cdebee;X79f50df59;X7a2ee39fc;X7a6ccf314;X7d9d47925;X7f4aef04f;X82690b573;X82d1a498b;X8320889b8;X83edc4e91;X84a92dce2;X854a8eb88;X859f44a9e;X86adc4f32;X87400eaf8;X87a6eca4b;X88626631e;X8a1ce7102;X8aca6970d;X8ae39e29d;X8bba2ac35;X8d00d5071;X8f425ea69;X8fc8408bc;X91ff33ccb;X933c74132;X941d64d85;X956a20a54;X961bb3d7a;X974a306cd;X9af48e66e;X9b5726c7b;X9c4449f74;X9d934b999;Xa0e5a1a6a;Xa1965c29a;Xa19e210b1;Xa2f84efb1;Xa5d92713e;Xa636bf8f0;Xa659a8bc4;Xa7163075d;Xa71b6c120;Xa758063c1;Xa87302ca2;Xa8cf25fe2;Xa95e65667;Xaa41262c0;Xaa894c2f0;Xaaf1dff52;Xab3a93e60;Xad66e866e;Xad780e783;Xae11164ec;Xaee4b21ae;Xaf95f0a06;Xb07472a35;Xb07b5c61c;Xb244c7803;Xb2db970cc;Xb2f4e4e2d;Xb334f3d88;Xb49c0819a;Xb5f223039;Xb748500c5;Xb7b920db6;Xb915c5e6c;Xbec2808b6;Xc069f6bff;Xc39af28a3;Xc433d6f75;Xc4cf90f6e;Xc66184916;Xc6d67164d;Xc8ca54454;Xc8febb964;Xcbbf5a9d7;Xcbdc8920e;Xcc3842ec5;Xccc668e15;Xccd88aa61;Xcf17b9f95;Xcf921be27;Xd16c29ccd;Xd1b04eed2;Xd4f803a8b;Xd69974383;Xd6a71279c;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdf2c9211c;Xe01d20346;Xe0823bc4b;Xe1b387cff;Xe2cca337f;Xe2daf857c;Xe2f11bebb;Xe305388bc;Xe4d28beb1;Xe51e869bc;Xe70852b82;Xe879b9960;Xe9ff57efa;Xeba197444;Xee1757997;Xee27720d7;Xef0ef2410;Xef37f56c5;Xf0153b270;Xf16b99f14;Xf1e2b76e4;Xf45f7ec2f;Xf4909695e;Xf7e2cbdca;Xf7e4a8ca5;Xf82b4f407;Xf886532e8;Xfa60f0844;Xfcb0c1ebd;Xfccc4cf67;Xfe0dcd017;Xfe3023020,269,Modeling and Analysis of Scholar Mobility on Scientific Landscape,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00523,2015
1476,"The evaluation of the quality of research at a national level has become increasingly common. The UK has been at the forefront of this trend having undertaken many assessments since 1986, the latest being the Research Excellence Framework in 2014. The argument of this paper is that, whatever the intended results in terms of evaluating and improving research, there have been many, presumably unintended, results that are highly undesirable for research and the university community more generally. We situate our analysis using Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction and then focus on the peculiarities of the 2008 RAE and the 2014 REF the rules of which allowed for, and indeed encouraged, significant game-playing on the part of striving universities. We conclude with practical recommendations to maintain the general intention of research assessment without the undesirable side-effects.","Mingers, John;White, Leroy",ArXiv e-prints,X0134b0a9c;X05a8a5d10;X079ece871;X07ae95b00;X07e267dbe;X08a056af0;X0afb86c81;X0be1bb71e;X0c3c36a21;X0db667b1c;X0f08f0621;X11f344636;X14b889fd0;X150d63f21;X16e0645ee;X176ee895a;X186fd3a1f;X192022ad0;X1941a5b2a;X19dd80345;X1cf89f3da;X1d5b4f04c;X1d7ddcb98;X1ffbfdaa1;X21a50f4fa;X21c60383c;X22c34ca1e;X23295fd37;X2347d0854;X23b81a2d4;X24c3c4b04;X258f767fa;X26bbd786f;X274a039ff;X2b1e26a26;X2b478c887;X2bd0a0eb0;X2c01f625c;X2d7333ef5;X2db3a055f;X2e21b0c22;X2f22c420c;X3205b659c;X320fa5a59;X34af13003;X350d251f3;X37824a08c;X38cc6f70b;X3bc002aac;X3c1e75651;X3cdb7e442;X3fab3d196;X3fef27c53;X4053828c2;X40c52fc97;X41cbd10c3;X427793ba6;X448afc8b9;X46a8784d4;X46de5627c;X46fda378e;X475c8bca1;X483a0cf42;X4879ac23e;X48b170aa6;X4a5c1fd62;X4a85b8694;X5041b7f0b;X5188f84ad;X52397d50a;X54477d2c0;X579f04b26;X5a55d35f2;X5b07ad0dd;X5b3d8ef9d;X5d152a4d3;X5d402129f;X5d5f2da68;X5d8c0120d;X5e4272229;X5e8ae6126;X5fba38335;X65fd39f45;X69170f31c;X69be65931;X6ae3d55ee;X6b2c7b750;X6b514decd;X6b5fd4931;X6da44c00f;X6dfadcf51;X6e438e180;X6eb9f926d;X6f8489def;X71e058f71;X724833c7a;X775e67102;X777d9b03c;X7844b513b;X78dca00ea;X79138d462;X7ba04b176;X7d694b9f9;X7de73399c;X7e336c7c1;X7e46ab0ee;X7f83f7ba6;X8249e9849;X82690b573;X8318e9daa;X8322342db;X8453330b4;X846d158d4;X864521ab3;X86a11bbe9;X8a24fc9f5;X8b07e2f90;X8b6157898;X8d05f83ff;X8d13fd726;X8f9141e57;X8fc8408bc;X912d9a3d8;X91880612f;X926e1e89d;X93866a3af;X94632b91c;X94d96f35a;X95e3615b5;X99101f43b;X9b0f6d3ac;X9cfc4317d;X9d1be04b9;X9e0a9514d;X9e1deb5d7;X9e8a5d7fa;Xa0627ba19;Xa0fad0b79;Xa1965c29a;Xa1a19172f;Xa1b994b71;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa474b43f5;Xa4e98785a;Xa636bf8f0;Xa63ee6df2;Xa659a8bc4;Xa69390096;Xa6bf33243;Xa726deb57;Xa7c042398;Xa7e652762;Xa99e8691f;Xa9c3d53c8;Xaa13115ab;Xaa669a65d;Xab01a1fa1;Xab44b2e26;Xada74b3a2;Xadd704ea2;Xae4685767;Xae7044234;Xb02d2fbbe;Xb1e1fc8d6;Xb2db970cc;Xb3a7fe885;Xb4982795d;Xb4f1a77fe;Xb50986381;Xb5f223039;Xb603e2118;Xb65298441;Xb723b5062;Xb727db08e;Xbb702f971;Xbc2ff2be9;Xc02d1b924;Xc0648cc09;Xc07d51da9;Xc0d2dc06d;Xc2a804c06;Xc369f5355;Xc3d28f532;Xc4a5a7871;Xc546ebc04;Xc863ebc5a;Xc884f3376;Xca2874355;Xcb9b87e35;Xcc5b632d6;Xccaf045da;Xce494b2ae;Xcf17b9f95;Xcf921be27;Xcfdfff5a2;Xd14086875;Xd39484e5b;Xd3cb012f0;Xd3ee292e7;Xd46a71cd4;Xd949b9fa0;Xd959e79cc;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdac09f5a3;Xdc4dca7f9;Xdd26de6f4;Xdd28446a5;Xddbc544dd;Xde69e31ce;Xe0a11657d;Xe0e57686f;Xe4dd52091;Xe59d62f23;Xe5b1182e5;Xe74c26d11;Xe76cc291d;Xe77107aa2;Xe8dca44d7;Xecf2e24dc;Xf0b1e1c8a;Xf0beb2595;Xf18a3c872;Xf18b22127;Xf2517d8a2;Xf4799c5a3;Xf498164a6;Xf55e558ee;Xf5a83abcf;Xf7293fe32;Xf808d0164;Xf90f3d0aa;Xfa8877b2d;Xfda1d1195;Xfe0dcd017;Xfe8471b84;Xff4189165;Xff54a80f7,237,Throwing Out the Baby with the Bathwater: The Undesirable Effects of National Research Assessment Exercises on Research,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00658,2015

This idea naturally builds on the dissemination and archival capabilities present in the modern internet, and indeed perpetual reviews exist already in some forms.

Further, such reviews published in a purely electronic format without space constraints can also permit more pedagogical scholarship and clearer treatment of technical issues that remain obscure in a brief treatment.","Mobley, David L.;Zuckerman, Daniel M.",ArXiv e-prints,4201071e72;X04543e269;X051177f2d;X0843ddabd;X08826ee22;X08e0ac88e;X098929b00;X0a31fdf09;X0db75a0b1;X0e1f05cdc;X10a10fbc4;X13e73c7e6;X15183a9d9;X15f1674f9;X163226af8;X1af8fec05;X1bfdacf27;X1d7ddcb98;X1f5a2a664;X1ffbfdaa1;X2368a345e;X24e96feb5;X279bc0935;X35439b6bd;X35c089549;X379f82587;X39dfe0f6d;X3b375e9c8;X3b7fa3a3a;X3d8d414c0;X4053828c2;X406931ba0;X4160dcdb7;X44063cd9c;X450571994;X455e85347;X46de5627c;X47076d9e7;X4866dc3ec;X4871cb83b;X4879ac23e;X4cc1cffe1;X4e32bac95;X5188f84ad;X549e8a565;X54f5f5c26;X55458f9c9;X58519ca70;X58af12aaa;X5960f9449;X5a55d35f2;X5f357a729;X5f538eeb6;X604d57b91;X6173cbd76;X61e7fa9c2;X629469808;X63d6c746e;X644226815;X67a531590;X6a5d6dcf2;X708b25705;X7199411a9;X73a9b8c7a;X74c60a409;X750765624;X751078d5e;X755efe0ad;X78ccf6572;X78dca00ea;X79fb3787f;X7aee5ed88;X7cd9882bf;X7dc638f87;X81c0f8602;X82690b573;X8426ae536;X84a92dce2;X875783253;X8b6157898;X8fc8408bc;X9235c6be2;X9827d7f9c;X98b37f5b5;X9b8c4b857;Xa206d28cf;Xa698faf7e;Xa726deb57;Xab70f9ca0;Xabddbc2c7;Xade70fbd6;Xaf353ea0c;Xb04635254;Xb11bc0a6f;Xb1ccc025c;Xb57df8fed;Xb5f223039;Xb659614a4;Xb6fe0a088;Xb7162c33e;Xb79805bf0;Xb9f76bbe0;Xbb27d7b05;Xbb702f971;Xbd5ad7583;Xbead0fcfd;Xbec2808b6;Xc01213e6e;Xc0a5ced61;Xc0bd0f3bf;Xc361086f5;Xc433d6f75;Xc4b7fb0c7;Xcb798ab25;Xcc5c011fd;Xcf17b9f95;Xcf921be27;Xd1880a119;Xd3f4b43bf;Xd7b66c7b1;Xd8019ff05;Xd9c69cbc0;Xddbc544dd;Xde439adba;Xe0f91570b;Xe3c5929d1;Xe4a9107bb;Xe5b1182e5;Xe65d7a90e;Xe67946af1;Xe790a2aea;Xe998a58d5;Xeeef9dc1c;Xf039fffab;Xf04865a83;Xf1b9569de;Xf23c990e6;Xf434ad2c2;Xf498164a6;Xff4189165,140,"A proposal for regularly updated review/survey articles: ""Perpetual Reviews""",http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01329,2015
1478,"The number of citations is a widely used metric for evaluating the scientific credit of papers, scientists and journals. However, it so happens that papers with fewer citations from prestigious scientists have a higher influence than papers with more citations. In this paper, we argue that by whom the paper is being cited is of greater significance than merely the number of citations. Accordingly, we propose an interactive model of author-paper bipartite networks as well as an iterative algorithm to obtain better rankings for scientists and their publications. The main advantage of this method is twofold: (i) it is a parameter-free algorithm; (ii) it considers the relationship between the prestige of scientists and the quality of their publications. We conducted real experiments on publications in econophysics, and used this method to evaluate the influence of related scientific journals. The comparison between the rankings by our method and simple citation counts suggests that our method is effective in distinguishing prestige from popularity.","Zhou, Yan-Bo;Lü, Linyuan;Li, Menghui",New Journal of Physics,54d98d3ca4;X30cd2689b;X4398b0324;X45978c3c3;X54018e6a3;X67edbe5ae;X6eb2e1e7e;X879f4e29b;Xa8e1ab5c8;Xb642613fe,10,Quantifying the influence of scientists and their publications: distinguishing between prestige and popularity,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1186,2012
1479,"Since its creation in 1991, arXiv has become central to the diffusion of research in a number of fields. Combining data from the entirety of arXiv and the Web of Science (WoS), this paper investigates (a) the proportion of papers across all disciplines that are on arXiv and the proportion of arXiv papers that are in the WoS, (b) elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication, and (c) the aging characteristics and scientific impact of arXiv e-prints and their published version. It shows that the proportion of WoS papers found on arXiv varies across the specialties of physics and mathematics, and that only a few specialties make extensive use of the repository. Elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication has shortened but remains longer in mathematics than in physics. In physics, mathematics, as well as in astronomy and astrophysics, arXiv versions are cited more promptly and decay faster than WoS papers. The arXiv versions of papers - both published and unpublished - have lower citation rates than published papers, although there is almost no difference in the impact of the arXiv versions of both published and unpublished papers.","Lariviere, Vincent;Sugimoto, Cassidy R.;Macaluso, Benoit;Milojevic, Stasa;Cronin, Blaise;Thelwall, Mike",ArXiv e-prints,X02d27dc1e;X07c20c0b2;X120139485;X15f0c021a;X1835febee;X18bff2d9d;X2a7efa9c1;X2c8732e96;X2ca7c9a93;X2dc0798ee;X32dd023e7;X32e2e5f59;X348814447;X3616ca0b2;X362fe6efc;X3bb114ea2;X3da6d53b9;X4c1b6d5d2;X4ff8f05a4;X527d043c7;X54dbf7d51;X55d16dbfa;X5a72e6a96;X5cbb1dce0;X5d2f1264f;X6230efdb0;X6974142b8;X6a61a08c2;X6ba3c6ebb;X6bfc76615;X6f537c9df;X6fb17ed24;X700cd4198;X7390376ed;X786521657;X7c42e8ee0;X7e18fd7c3;X801615822;X8249adb30;X854b3e855;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X8d516eead;X9156758d1;X94acbeac8;X9dc71f356;Xa14f38f4b;Xadd66b30a;Xb1875d7bd;Xb50e05f0b;Xb59cbb517;Xb8a26111d;Xb9ede2f83;Xba9e90876;Xc30e3b9aa;Xcc1c6d2fc;Xd011d9c1b;Xd0df9119e;Xda7b026af;Xdac0baf07;Xdf5b6863d;Xe35341fe0;Xe36e5e5fb;Xe5283b6b2;Xe7f4c2311;Xefdebb465;Xf3b223276;Xf8046f226;Xfa38250f3;Xfb8979f0d;Xfc2f1a66c,71,arXiv e-prints and the journal of record: An analysis of roles and relationships,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3261,2013

1481,"The study explores the citedness of research data, its distribution over time and how it is related to the availability of a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) in Thomson Reuters' DCI (Data Citation Index). We investigate if cited research data ""impact"" the (social) web, reflected by altmetrics scores, and if there is any relationship between the number of citations and the sum of altmetrics scores from various social media-platforms. Three tools are used to collect and compare altmetrics scores, i.e. PlumX, ImpactStory, and Altmetric.com. In terms of coverage, PlumX is the most helpful altmetrics tool. While research data remain mostly uncited (about 85%), there has been a growing trend in citing data sets published since 2007. Surprisingly, the percentage of the number of cited research data with a DOI in DCI has decreased in the last years. Only nine repositories account for research data with DOIs and two or more citations. The number of cited research data with altmetrics scores is even lower (4 to 9%) but shows a higher coverage of research data from the last decade. However, no correlation between the number of citations and the total number of altmetrics scores is observable.

1482,"We explore the statistical structure of scientific community based on multivariate analysis of publication (or other identifiable metrics) distribution in the author space. Here, we define community based on keywords, i.e. projecting semantic content of the documents on predefined meanings; however, more complex approaches based on semantic clustering of publications are possible. Remarkably, this simple statistical analysis of publication metadata allows understanding of internal interactions with community in general agreement with experience acquired over decades of social interaction within it. We further discuss potential applications of this approach for ranking within the community, reviewer selection, and optimization of community output.","Kalinin, Sergei V.;Maksov, Artem",ArXiv e-prints,X023c75145;X02b103de9;X032eecbfe;X03bc440ea;X04602db0c;X058cff3d7;X05a8a5d10;X0609f3c19;X08020cd9f;X0843ddabd;X08e0ac88e;X0b559beb5;X0bd0d94bd;X0beba9e1f;X0d2500f23;X0f4c68708;X1058ea310;X1205c64ff;X12a9e0c37;X15b457c26;X15b817b30;X172ad9b6e;X18fa69247;X1951df7ec;X1c589748a;X1d7ddcb98;X1f263cde1;X1fbae0d94;X2182679da;X21a55a180;X21d05798d;X28750c18f;X2916cb14e;X2b937396e;X2ba29801e;X2c3bb617b;X2d71c3a69;X2d7333ef5;X2ed1220df;X2f1aa9fc3;X30d2a951e;X3127d050f;X31e2c85d9;X32640406f;X32b2f4b05;X32e23c073;X33e1ea047;X34110efab;X35dcd8fd1;X35ec75c6c;X35f031a9a;X362e60f42;X3674f2a05;X37485daa2;X3760bbc70;X379f82587;X37bdb7677;X37e2f1061;X38575e34c;X3a01366b1;X3a1169a87;X3a361e5ff;X3b1a9cbe8;X3b375e9c8;X3b41c8d96;X3bcb0dd03;X3c26ebf96;X3e7fa17a1;X41b9064b8;X41f8a2804;X420e57683;X42514b92b;X42a5d5e1d;X430dacbfc;X43d2cfa0b;X45ab1b8cd;X45c6c990b;X47b720605;X483a0cf42;X4866dc3ec;X4969ab03f;X498db336f;X4c0d1192c;X4c2483cc9;X4e5245495;X5188f84ad;X53307e635;X539db1439;X540fb41b0;X54b420cb8;X5571a20ce;X56d07593c;X571bd8c26;X585fd6173;X58e418d7f;X59f1b34dd;X5a3e2ca22;X5cb802067;X5d04331ce;X5df17651d;X5e35be975;X5e8ae6126;X5f83a39bc;X5f956405e;X604d57b91;X60af20a37;X60ec2c846;X62faaadd4;X63026c87d;X6345cb557;X644282b2e;X644a396cb;X64632df8c;X677456b52;X67a531590;X68696d2a7;X69be65931;X6a1a40228;X6ae3d55ee;X6c2619b80;X6da93dc68;X6e2c6627c;X6f8a207d9;X70ad3addd;X71e980174;X727f5dd36;X73aa591a1;X7424759a9;X74444778e;X75352b648;X76421d989;X764fe1c2b;X76e3dcb28;X776244a63;X785ab0133;X78a913ab2;X78dca00ea;X794eb6d82;X79f24fa4b;X7c33dde64;X7d8bb3e51;X7dc7abfa6;X7e6cad377;X7e93a5e0a;X7ed3873e4;X7f411aac3;X82690b573;X82b97e84b;X83a7e64ff;X8426ae536;X850579633;X855e0d5b0;X89097ff29;X897b7d532;X89b324b38;X8b4bc7d88;X8b54dcddb;X8ba7dcc41;X901cdd336;X933c74132;X93d993717;X93da915ee;X9501b840d;X9536475c7;X95860b83a;X96d2bb012;X96e33ceb2;X98cf2ae57;X9a44f4223;X9af48e66e;X9b1847473;X9b9e80300;X9d3292956;X9f524fb9d;X9ff0a4a55;Xa0ae8c162;Xa1b994b71;Xa41b998da;Xa474b43f5;Xa49def6df;Xa5d72bd9c;Xa636bf8f0;Xa659a8bc4;Xa673aff6e;Xa80b6723a;Xa87302ca2;Xa95e65667;Xa9c852605;Xab160b4a6;Xab2b05b07;Xabdb3db5b;Xac3ea2b56;Xad069d522;Xae9e8d368;Xb11bc0a6f;Xb1ccc025c;Xb3a3efc5f;Xb5fdf975f;Xb71074f55;Xb937e34ff;Xb94560db2;Xb9b9b59f6;Xba4221eba;Xba7de63a8;Xbb0add65b;Xbb702f971;Xbba2dcd71;Xbc55c3f51;Xbd74722d2;Xbdba93d59;Xbf8785735;Xc01213e6e;Xc01ec2aa4;Xc0d89014d;Xc0dbc876f;Xc0f33219f;Xc1ddbb9db;Xc20340ad2;Xc21904310;Xc236daa80;Xc319acae4;Xc369f5355;Xc5ae1fe86;Xc601294ec;Xc9f8dc484;Xcccbc2c07;Xccd88aa61;Xcde1c2147;Xd0a69351e;Xd248f9b5a;Xd2ae0b0e6;Xd363d6baf;Xd4427cd4e;Xd4f803a8b;Xd51d20eda;Xd54acce0b;Xd67929550;Xd686b73f8;Xd6b02f72c;Xd90a3727b;Xd9c69cbc0;Xda88f3e80;Xdbe0be21b;Xdc6fc434a;Xdf1bd37f6;Xdf2c9211c;Xe03ac6747;Xe0437f3ff;Xe0aa3d39c;Xe0f91570b;Xe4181df7b;Xe445280af;Xe55be1db5;Xe71d36bf7;Xe91177dba;Xea17986e3;Xebe6dd5d1;Xed5ecc097;Xed6e3f65b;Xf1e2b76e4;Xf2fc04db8;Xf4f646e79;Xf61e959eb;Xf64a847a1;Xf782e1772;Xf7ad8d5e6;Xf7b521a3c;Xfa8f5efd7;Xfb2df0774;Xfe7fb6d71;Xff0cf581a;Xffe32807f,272,"What makes us a community: structure, correlations, and success in scientific world",http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03439,2015

Its results show a dynamic congress, essentially national and professional, with a strong majority of individual authorships, even with the recent growth of the ratio of collaborations. In its thematic approach, emphasis is given to public services of information, with the greatest focus being on libraries, while still giving relevance to reflections on professional and academic training in the area of Information Sciences, and also following the most recent technological developments.","Roque de Oliveira, Silvana;Moreira, Catarina;Borbinha, José;Ámgeles Zuleta Garcia, María",ArXiv e-prints,X0d74db05f;X2e7dc1c88;X46ee91134;X623c9bb10;X6a5c6a50b;X8625bad7f;Xaef17829d;Xafdd937df;Xb6629579e;Xc19f7fdb8;Xc8642bb05;Xcefac67da;Xfd11afdf4;Xfd724135e,14,"Uma an\'alise bibliom\'etrica do Congresso Nacional de Bibliotec\'arios, Arquivistas e Documentalistas (1985-2012)",http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05136,2015
1484,"2015 is the centennial of Einstein General Relativity. On this occasion, we examine the General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (GRQC) field of research by analysing 38291 papers uploaded on the electronic archives arXiv.org from 2000 to 2012. We establish a map of the countries contributing to GRQC in 2012. We determine the main journals publishing GRQC papers and which countries publish in which journals. We find that more and more papers are written by groups (instead of single) of authors with more and more international collaborations. There are huge differences between countries. Hence Russia is the country where most of papers are written by single authors whereas Canada is one of the countries where the most of papers are written with international collaborations. We also study mobility of researchers, determining how some groups of authors spread worldwide with time for different countries. The largest mobilities (as well as international collaborations) are between USA-UK and USA-Germany. Countries attracting the most of GRQC authors are Netherlands and Canada whereas those undergoing a brain drain are Italy and India. There are few mobility between Europe and Asia contrarily to mobility between USA and Asia.","Fay, Stephane;Gautrias, Sebastien",ArXiv

1485,"In this report we examine the change in citation behavior since the introduction of the arXiv e-print repository (Ginsparg, 2001). It has been observed that papers that initially appear as arXiv e-prints get cited more than papers that do not (Lawrence, 2001; Brody et al., 2004; Schwarz & Kennicutt, 2004; Kurtz et al., 2005a, Metcalfe, 2005). Using the citation statistics from the NASA-Smithsonian Astrophysics Data System (ADS; Kurtz et al., 1993, 2000), we confirm the findings from other studies, we examine the average citation rate to e-printed papers in the Astrophysical Journal, and we show that for a number of major astronomy and physics journals the most important papers are submitted to the arXiv e-print repository first.","Henneken, Edwin A.;Kurtz, Michael J.;Eichhorn, Guenther;Accomazzi, Alberto;Grant, Carolyn;Thompson, Donna;Murray, Stephen S.",Journal of Electronic Publishing,54dbeb0d20;54e4a0e0d3;54ed0ca2db;54f0da33d3;X02bf59d04;X05a8e10f5;X07c20c0b2;X149053962;X17e9b2c51;X18f7acb5c;X1a97a5be0;X48221d263;X4c1b6d5d2;X4ee134e48;X5d2f1264f;X60e410849;X63b18899f;X65a8ca0df;X65db14123;X6974142b8;X79e684fd3;X8249adb30;X86c487c6e;X898d74472;X8b32c4c77;X8b6d6d136;X8cc33ff94;X936cfa990;X9a38d521b;X9dc71f356;Xa418d1dc6;Xa4215e246;Xa55dd0b10;Xb1875d7bd;Xb1d416cda;Xba9e90876;Xc254abe83;Xc6221cf90;Xc9f8881b8;Xd011d9c1b;Xe0296eee8;Xe709d637e;Xeaa1af952;Xfa114a658;Xfab149e5b;Xfcb091817;Xff9c3bc5d,47,Effect of E-printing on Citation Rates in Astronomy and Physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0604061,2006
1486,"Most tools for accessing digitized historical newspapers emphasize relatively simple search; but, as increasing numbers of digitized historical newspapers and other historical resources become available we can consider much richer modes of interaction with these collections. For instance, users might use exploratory search for looking at larger issues and events such as elections and campaigns or to get a sense of ""the texture of the city"" or ""what the city was thinking"". To take full advantage of rich interface tools, the content of the newspapers needs to be described systematically and accurately. Moreover, collections of multiple newspapers need to be richly cross-indexed across titles and even with historical resources beyond the newspapers.","Allen, Robert B.",ArXiv e-prints,4201071e72;X05a8a5d10;X060b02504;X09273f859;X0b559beb5;X15183a9d9;X1608ff8d9;X1951df7ec;X2080fea6f;X2979d8980;X2a95b6312;X2ed1220df;X2ef7fe3d7;X33b199f6f;X34641e0d7;X35073f676;X36fd51807;X379f82587;X3b2b0c819;X3b375e9c8;X3d7a244b0;X3ecc3c39d;X42345df31;X43e3ca186;X542b3d60b;X55a886bb2;X5891891ba;X5cb802067;X5df17651d;X5f667792e;X604d57b91;X62d45a953;X6a510bc56;X75319ba5d;X82b97e84b;X8989b46f9;X8ea89bf34;X8f4e93e86;X9231ce6c4;X9af48e66e;X9d02aaa76;Xa770c1662;Xa82d2fd79;Xaf353ea0c;Xb10255840;Xb11bc0a6f;Xb12952a16;Xb1ccc025c;Xb775d8e8d;Xbb702f971;Xbc211a2a6;Xc01213e6e;Xc069f6bff;Xc29018b08;Xc8c2965af;Xd48e9e83d;Xd5e0aa6e3;Xd7bf3a952;Xd9c69cbc0;Xe6f645a62;Xec8e900fe;Xf16ec38f0;Xf61e959eb;Xf808d0164;Xfba3d1cbb,65,"Improving Access to Digitized Historical Newspapers with Text Mining, Coordinated Models, and Formative User Interface Design",http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03943,2015

1491,"This article analyzes Twitter as a potential alternative source of external links for use in webometric analysis because of its capacity to embed hyperlinks in different tweets. Given the limitations on searching Twitter's public API, we decided to use the Topsy search engine as a source for compiling tweets. To this end, we took a global sample of 200 universities and compiled all the tweets with hyperlinks to any of these institutions. Further link data was obtained from alternative sources (MajesticSEO and OpenSiteExplorer) in order to compare the results. Thereafter, various statistical tests were performed to determine the correlation between the indicators and the ability to predict external links from the collected tweets. The results indicate a high volume of tweets, although they are skewed by the presence and performance of specific universities and countries. The data provided by Topsy correlated significantly with all link indicators, particularly with OpenSiteExplorer (r=0.769). Finally, prediction models do not provide optimum results because of high error rates, which fall slightly in nonlinear models applied to specific environments. We conclude that the use of Twitter (via Topsy) as a source of hyperlinks to universities produces promising results due to its high correlation with link indicators, though limited by policies and culture regarding use and presence in social networks.","Orduna-Malea, Enrique;Torres-Salinas, Daniel;Delgado Lopez-Cozar, Emilio",ArXiv e-prints,X0256234df;X037113bb8;X043b834eb;X060b02504;X066efb484;X0a02020bd;X0b559beb5;X0bcc9a4de;X0d74db05f;X0f5e339ea;X0fd338cea;X172add237;X1c7a16b8e;X1ce015912;X1f40e7ee1;X1f845bf62;X2a9e5e6c9;X2bc8cb212;X2e4a8dd11;X2e6dbbf4d;X30b216a19;X32c8c64f5;X38bda7f24;X3c412de27;X3c67b9e96;X3f4f0e831;X4249c5158;X4288dd57c;X4713ec466;X47931d88d;X4d8d86a7c;X4e964cbbd;X4ff4aa954;X5054c41e5;X50694bbed;X5148fd731;X5188f84ad;X546c5946e;X55239f116;X5a51ba639;X5bf750695;X5f667792e;X64632df8c;X65c19801e;X6b06c3ac7;X6ffeb40ee;X71f0cb658;X740e7f439;X76c07df04;X7ff62e85c;X8149c46ea;X82690b573;X875783253;X9033e7d97;X91ff33ccb;X938b4a20e;X94234f87c;X95b66e5df;X963d02e38;X9b5425294;X9b7f7975f;X9ff36009c;Xa1b994b71;Xa82d2fd79;Xb12952a16;Xb767275b5;Xb834ab51a;Xbb702f971;Xbb7ff0da8;Xbdfd46464;Xc0548e30c;Xc369f5355;Xc871a19e3;Xd6e08c082;Xd720631ee;Xd7531a567;Xd83103ee3;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdab5b7daa;Xdb802f809;Xe305388bc;Xe57f6296a;Xe903615c3;Xe9fd9750a;Xeac2f9c20;Xec8e900fe;Xecfb40154;Xf63030080;Xfeea9b770;Xffe64f404,90,Hyperlinks embedded in Twitter as a proxy for total external inlinks to international university websites,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04250,2015
1492,"Using Web-of-Science data, portfolio analysis in terms of journal coverage can be projected on a base map for units of analysis such as countries, cities, universities, and firms. The units of analysis under study can be compared statistically across the 10,000+ journals. The interdisciplinarity of the portfolios is measured using Rao-Stirling diversity or Zhang et al.'s (in press) improved measure 2D3. At the country level we find regional differentiation (e.g., Latin-American or Asian countries), but also a major divide between advanced and less-developed countries. Israel and Israeli cities outperform other nations and cities in terms of diversity. Universities appear to be specifically related to firms when a number of these units are exploratively compared.

Here, we derive a mechanistic model for the citation dynamics of individual papers, allowing us to collapse the citation histories of papers from different journals and disciplines into a single curve, indicating that all papers tend to follow the same universal temporal pattern.

1494,"Modern bibliographic databases provide the basis for scientific research and its evaluation. While their content and structure differ substantially, there exist only informal notions on their reliability. Here we compare the topological consistency of citation networks extracted from six popular bibliographic databases including Web of Science, CiteSeer and arXiv.org. The networks are assessed through a rich set of local and global graph statistics. We first reveal statistically significant inconsistencies between some of the databases with respect to individual statistics. For example, the introduced field bow-tie decomposition of DBLP Computer Science Bibliography substantially differs from the rest due to the coverage of the database, while the citation information within arXiv.org is the most exhaustive. Finally, we compare the databases over multiple graph statistics using the critical difference diagram. The citation topology of DBLP Computer Science Bibliography is the least consistent with the rest, while, not surprisingly, Web of Science is significantly more reliable from the perspective of consistency. This work can serve either as a reference for scholars in bibliometrics and scientometrics or a scientific evaluation guideline for governments and research agencies.","Šubelj, Lovro;Fiala, Dalibor;Bajec, Marko",Scientific Reports,54ebc899a4;X023c75145;X07ac1a2c6;X0918eaa41;X09a018eb4;X0a679e60f;X0b559beb5;X0c5c20443;X1039e4a75;X1205c64ff;X124bcd52e;X127be1bea;X183402a4b;X1871b75fb;X18a3cc441;X19420e4e4;X1d2aec6fa;X206f62660;X20cd1447d;X2107c7b8a;X23295fd37;X247faf1f5;X25f5cde96;X2aeb94028;X2ced661f0;X2d5ac6208;X2d7333ef5;X2ec6d36dd;X2ecd3804b;X303889f1a;X30c1d3f48;X30d6f2ed1;X36355dc3c;X368ea629f;X3a1ca3998;X3b290a086;X3b82f5d6e;X3e4ce6bd0;X3f7816c72;X46c39dcee;X47d37ebc6;X491d70893;X49852fc76;X49ae20e58;X4c18523ed;X4c2483cc9;X4c89f21af;X4f80d89c1;X5188f84ad;X521c2e83a;X531fa838c;X53daf67b1;X540fb41b0;X544ce2b79;X550fadc40;X56d07593c;X5b6ef911f;X5cbf56e70;X5d152a4d3;X5e5f8ce14;X5f667792e;X6077cc92e;X63bce2118;X64632df8c;X67b1432b7;X683b46fb1;X68c52d4c8;X68cc1de55;X69be65931;X6a510bc56;X6d1e351f4;X6d3036b24;X6d8b88ef3;X729c9f09a;X73ee05fc3;X750765624;X772ed3ee2;X77310f6d3;X78dca00ea;X79385eb59;X7967b70b2;X7aad426bd;X7e6cad377;X7ed9d7f25;X7fc3ddaba;X80d02c37d;X8123b5d5b;X848eef912;X855e0d5b0;X85c16944a;X88fbf066b;X8989b46f9;X89b324b38;X8f2b7fd9b;X91ff33ccb;X933c74132;X93f68916c;X946dd0a74;X94d96f35a;X97cd5937b;X9909c5134;X9d8588c10;X9ff0a4a55;Xa0f20e12a;Xa1965c29a;Xa2fd2936f;Xa3bc20609;Xa71b6c120;Xa82d2fd79;Xab2b05b07;Xab2c0240c;Xace8be817;Xacf13280a;Xb026c9044;Xb08faf412;Xb427f0353;Xb6a33544c;Xbb702f971;Xbc1518554;Xbd548c3f7;Xbde2153e9;Xbe7d0df7f;Xc01213e6e;Xc01a19aec;Xc01ec2aa4;Xc20340ad2;Xc230207e6;Xc2e183276;Xc3733d4f0;Xc76a6584a;Xc83254757;Xc931cb0f7;Xcdf51f602;Xce3f1783d;Xcf17b9f95;Xd02695ab2;Xd2e495f7d;Xd3a4c62ab;Xd4c5a1216;Xd52c9656d;Xd56e31f5f;Xd6e08c082;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdae5e9766;Xdd6fc26a6;Xdf2c9211c;Xe20a4eac8;Xe5b1182e5;Xe5b27b210;Xe650805cd;Xe7aaf5f7c;Xeb4e74887;Xeba197444;Xeba8011b3;Xec8e900fe;Xef37f56c5;Xf11c63983;Xf247ab6e0;Xf34921998;Xf3a883823;Xfa9673e75;Xfc3624d25;Xfd280f339;Xfd53e0b34;Xfe7fb6d71,165,Network-based statistical comparison of citation topology of bibliographic databases,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05061,2014
1495,"More than 30 years after Cronin's seminal paper on ""the need for a theory of citing"" (Cronin, 1981), the metrics community is once again in need of a new theory, this time one for so-called ""altmetrics"". Altmetrics, short for alternative (to citation) metrics -- and as such a misnomer -- refers to a new group of metrics based (largely) on social media events relating to scholarly communication. As current definitions of altmetrics are shaped and limited by active platforms, technical possibilities, and business models of aggregators such as Altmetric.com, ImpactStory, PLOS, and Plum Analytics, and as such constantly changing, this work refrains from defining an umbrella term for these very heterogeneous new metrics. Instead a framework is presented that describes acts leading to (online) events on which the metrics are based. These activities occur in the context of social media, such as discussing on Twitter or saving to Mendeley, as well as downloading and citing. The framework groups various types of acts into three categories -- accessing, appraising, and applying -- and provides examples of actions that lead to visibility and traceability online. To improve the understanding of the acts, which result in online events from which metrics are collected, select citation and social theories are used to interpret the phenomena being measured. Citation theories are used because the new metrics based on these events are supposed to replace or complement citations as indicators of impact. Social theories, on the other hand, are discussed because there is an inherent social aspect to the measurements.","Haustein, Stefanie;Bowman, Timothy D.;Costas, Rodrigo",ArXiv

1496,"Scientists have an inherent interest in claiming their contributions to the scholarly record, but the fragmented state of identity management across the landscape of astronomy, physics, and other fields makes highlighting the contributions of any single individual a formidable and often frustratingly complex task. The problem is exacerbated by the expanding variety of academic research products and the growing footprints of large collaborations and interdisciplinary teams.

1497,"Scholars have often relied on name initials to resolve name ambiguities in large-scale coauthorship network research. This approach bears the risk of incorrectly merging or splitting author identities. The use of initial-based disambiguation has been justified by the assumption that such errors would not affect research findings too much. This paper tests this assumption by analyzing coauthorship networks from five academic fields - biology, computer science, nanoscience, neuroscience, and physics - and an interdisciplinary journal, PNAS. Name instances in datasets of this study were disambiguated based on heuristics gained from previous algorithmic disambiguation solutions. We use disambiguated data as a proxy of ground-truth to test the performance of three types of initial-based disambiguation. Our results show that initial-based disambiguation can misrepresent statistical properties of coauthorship networks: it deflates the number of unique authors, number of component, average shortest paths, clustering coefficient, and assortativity, while it inflates average productivity, density, average coauthor number per author, and largest component size. Also, on average, more than half of top 10 productive or collaborative authors drop off the lists. Asian names were found to account for the majority of misidentification by initial-based disambiguation due to their common surname and given name initials.","Kim, Jinseok;Diesner, Jana",ArXiv e-prints,X000789272;X019187be8;X02b314529;X036d5d2f9;X03820728d;X044ae9dfa;X058810137;X05ab37694;X05f7f16c3;X0782bed34;X09a018eb4;X0b559beb5;X0d3e88cb6;X0ef113b3c;X0fa719586;X1205c64ff;X1340661d0;X163d61a42;X16aa50f6f;X172454fab;X181898b2d;X1912b4a17;X1ed28dc4a;X1f4d190d0;X1f9552495;X226eeeec6;X249467e90;X266cc033f;X28d3d354e;X2ab31b8e6;X2bcf6248f;X2d5ac6208;X2d7d9d257;X2f15d4a4c;X30cd2689b;X31683f9b6;X362c1607c;X3966bba20;X3b41c8d96;X3bfe54ea8;X3d7a244b0;X3df9e8470;X3e4ce6bd0;X4014c1b40;X408bc509f;X45877e8c1;X45dc85808;X47429825e;X47d37ebc6;X498db336f;X4a6c47fe4;X4c2483cc9;X4dd09130d;X4f80d89c1;X4fc7fbbc0;X4fd6cb7d9;X4ff4aa954;X5043f5aae;X53a702357;X55af41ad7;X57b87dd02;X596c7b1bf;X5a59d96c5;X5c1696485;X5df72bf5f;X5e4272229;X5e908a447;X5ede9e8f1;X5f667792e;X612fca347;X61b115c8a;X62709936c;X62deb331d;X670ef5d33;X67429abaf;X677456b52;X68305c870;X6922c1e2c;X6ba7866f1;X6e6adc70b;X6fbcc38cb;X702a084bf;X731f0f864;X78dca00ea;X794e81e49;X7b8b1300d;X7cadeabd8;X7d4763b66;X7e6cad377;X7f4aef04f;X835921e36;X8359548ee;X85223adae;X85589f800;X87b626311;X890e93cea;X8cf9d6058;X8e9d34e0f;X8eacea9c2;X8f1fe800d;X902c7e14c;X9133e0f9d;X9209a2d10;X933c74132;X961bb3d7a;X9a0a0345a;X9b5425294;X9c25e1ff2;X9c322688e;X9d7d29a9b;Xa1baae54b;Xa27cbb0cc;Xa5583ab54;Xa71b6c120;Xa82d2fd79;Xa927e9c6c;Xab0cd1eb0;Xacbb4f039;Xacccaa400;Xb2cde3b9e;Xb2f9896e7;Xba11e7931;Xbb89de23b;Xbbfa2d732;Xbcd1c2238;Xbcf326b12;Xbe967c891;Xc08dfe418;Xc224ca24f;Xc25d2eff1;Xc3edc40f3;Xc4e40cc39;Xc8633a2f4;Xc871a19e3;Xc8ab5c136;Xcae784ec4;Xcb0113618;Xcd274c6d2;Xcd5ce65f2;Xcd96aedd5;Xcea223bf8;Xcece29756;Xcf49db632;Xd027c4a8e;Xd48fa6f57;Xd55ac1b3b;Xd56e31f5f;Xd6ac9baed;Xd6b7190a8;Xd75216f89;Xd7899ce87;Xd7c8fe091;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdc9afb10e;Xdfd3c4fc2;Xe183db986;Xe2e618aed;Xe48329c9e;Xe57f6296a;Xe81694760;Xe9ea9cfe1;Xeba197444;Xee9216716;Xef37f56c5;Xefa6cec1d;Xf01de89c2;Xf0ec93927;Xf0f347e95;Xf5045a97f;Xf9583f789;Xfb62a6e93;Xfc30228da;Xff5c73438,173,Distortive Effects of Initial-Based Name Disambiguation on Measurements of Large-Scale Coauthorship Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06306,2015
1498,"In addition to shaping social networks, for example, in terms of co-authorship relations, scientific communications induce and reproduce cognitive structures. Scientific literature is intellectually organized in terms of disciplines and specialties; these structures are reproduced and networked reflexively by making references to the authors, concepts and texts embedded in these literatures. The concept of a cognitive structure was introduced in social network analysis (SNA) in 1987 by David Krackhardt, but the focus in SNA has hitherto been on cognition as a psychological attribute of human agency. In bibliometrics, and in science and technology studies (STS) more generally, socio-cognitive structures refer to intellectual organization at the supra-individual level. This intellectual organization emerges and is reproduced by the collectives of authors who are organized not only in terms of inter-personal relations, but also more abstractly in terms of codes of communication that are field-specific. Citations can serve as indicators of this codification process.","Leydesdorff, Loet",ArXiv e-prints,413dc5cd37;54e7c95c48;5519f190ff;X01b9b6e2b;X023c75145;X03bb6031f;X05a8a5d10;X05c5d4d26;X060b02504;X08826ee22;X08bfa28d0;X08f270e01;X09a018eb4;X0b559beb5;X0c6892e83;X12da4409e;X156289bb4;X1639b05e5;X16aa50f6f;X19f9f1618;X1b428b7a5;X1ceab81e4;X1e44b5209;X21e51d306;X2c1e5f4dd;X2f22c420c;X2f26bf923;X2fa33fb96;X32bc3f3aa;X398ab32a7;X39e87e148;X3a1b35a3b;X3bcb0dd03;X3df9e8470;X3f1f569a5;X3f5f7fbda;X41dbb0b23;X45cf6c814;X46be42b82;X49bfac06a;X4d601744f;X4f7c2a7e0;X4f80d89c1;X501ecfc7c;X54477d2c0;X56d5a6f02;X58b1a6749;X5b0bd5413;X5b40c1b6a;X5cb802067;X5cf5fc891;X5e13311b1;X5f667792e;X61b115c8a;X6219ca39b;X62906b5c6;X64632df8c;X668814c5b;X6ba7866f1;X729c9f09a;X76bef863f;X777d9b03c;X78ccf6572;X78dca00ea;X78f3f1285;X7b67d5bac;X7e6cad377;X7ed9d7f25;X7f4aef04f;X85d68a763;X862a31899;X8b31f59d9;X90629ccaa;X937a3501e;X961bb3d7a;X981a759d6;X9894090bc;X9a0a0345a;X9c322688e;Xa22f83d88;Xa474b43f5;Xa82d2fd79;Xa92f9b839;Xab18a8335;Xac85817af;Xacbb4f039;Xaccf92731;Xad3a60751;Xb0531f3fb;Xb2f2bbfdd;Xb912e1b53;Xbde027b1e;Xbe4e39122;Xc01213e6e;Xc03d06431;Xc25d2eff1;Xcb26bfe63;Xcb73da9b1;Xcf32d617f;Xd05aaf6fc;Xd7c8fe091;Xd84d825b7;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdaeaef3db;Xdb3501e33;Xe06105d7c;Xe3155998f;Xe325772b6;Xeb8a58ad2;Xec40c352b;Xec90277e0;Xf55d8302d;Xf7b521a3c;Xf8b755325;Xfbbb3f08b,115,Bibliometrics/Citation networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06378,2015
1499,"Author name ambiguity decreases the quality and reliability of information retrieved from digital libraries. Existing methods have tried to solve this problem by predefining a feature set based on expert's knowledge for a specific dataset. In this paper, we propose a new approach which uses deep neural network to learn features automatically from data. Additionally, we propose the general system architecture for author name disambiguation on any dataset. In this research, we evaluate the proposed method on a dataset containing Vietnamese author names. The results show that this method significantly outperforms other methods that use predefined feature set. The proposed method achieves 99.31% in terms of accuracy. Prediction error rate decreases from 1.83% to 0.69%, i.e., it decreases by 1.14%, or 62.3% relatively compared with other methods that use predefined feature set (Table 3).","Nghiep Tran, Hung;Huynh, Tin;Do, Tien",ArXiv e-prints,X004e17fe3;X026b0c001;X03d3df6de;X05758ea65;X05a485979;X066efb484;X067c014a0;X0ee7edd95;X153277281;X15666ad39;X1671d6036;X16da2e1ee;X17c4195d8;X1b428b7a5;X1f014c9f0;X202048f55;X2347d0854;X23685ee49;X2468e4cfe;X24fe68af1;X2dc5412d2;X2dcc65711;X31f8fedc6;X320fa5a59;X34a12d80a;X367db21c5;X37348fd67;X382d65659;X387201e6d;X3e96a80f9;X3f9f6f64e;X3fcc9bcf7;X40317627a;X405e87f54;X46aae292e;X48463f4f5;X4af4b4796;X4dedebd91;X4e1668893;X4e4b0bffe;X513c43b4f;X51d56bc75;X53ffae1cd;X5443b3fa8;X5532a1d8f;X574549796;X58af12aaa;X593f8c8b1;X5a55d35f2;X5a66560f5;X5b5cd011a;X5d0d37e8e;X639641281;X644bf8812;X64dc4f049;X65fa53b6b;X6706f8c62;X68881de33;X68c157c73;X69beb7746;X6b309c1ad;X6bc248848;X6c1d19f2b;X6c58ea15a;X6c6550413;X74cd815b4;X75baaf6ac;X777260c9f;X77dc3abc7;X7813dd121;X78c4096f4;X7a1238d43;X7cdc66e5a;X7cfd11e45;X7e9a6839c;X7ed9d7f25;X82690b573;X82ba1c9b0;X852688b9a;X870efe932;X888a329bc;X890ea85c8;X8aa04af52;X8e4457a97;X8e45f1c5e;X8ed446a80;X91b989e98;X9211868d6;X936fd70ac;X956473b3a;X9662fc4e4;X9cd764f08;X9daeacc3b;X9f8331528;Xa3f390e8d;Xa4ff50be9;Xa68d7e3d9;Xa82d2fd79;Xa961ded77;Xae7ab9ee4;Xaed5f7894;Xb5cd7cc99;Xb8ba5caa9;Xb8f643bdb;Xba1732569;Xbb0fa5d35;Xbf8cedbb0;Xbfe89a4d8;Xc01213e6e;Xc0ceadece;Xc2971c6e0;Xc55e43baa;Xc7bb4cff6;Xc823b2544;Xc8359da70;Xc8ccb6c55;Xc9898dd7b;Xca0fc156d;Xca6113d23;Xcb26bfe63;Xce6897ee1;Xd3986a9c2;Xd861c3434;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdf2c4a773;Xe20e9bcdf;Xe32e0f19b;Xe7240da4f;Xe7e1234a2;Xe9a958b48;Xeac2f9c20;Xed5ecc097;Xee8437a17;Xf4133633c;Xf4b122b5f;Xf5bf97a51;Xf7b521a3c;Xf7df46f3a,138,Author Name Disambiguation by Using Deep Neural Network,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.08030,2015
1500,"Documenting the context in which data are collected is an integral part of the scientific research lifecycle. In field-based research, contextual information provides a detailed description of scientific practices and thus enables data interpretation and reuse. For field data, losing contextual information often means losing the data altogether. Yet, documenting the context of distributed, collaborative, field-based research can be a significant challenge due to the unpredictable nature of real-world settings and to the high degree of variability in data collection methods and scientific practices of different researchers. In this article, we propose the use of microblogging as a mechanism to support collection, ingestion, and publication of contextual information about the variegated digital artifacts that are produced in field research. We perform interviews with scholars involved in field-based environmental and urban sensing research, to determine the extent of adoption of Twitter and similar microblogging platforms and their potential use for field-specific research applications. Based on the results of these interviews as well as participant observation of field activities, we present the design, development, and pilot evaluation of a microblogging application integrated with an existing data collection platform on a handheld device. We investigate whether microblogging accommodates the variable and unpredictable nature of highly mobile research and whether it represents a suitable mechanism to document the context of field research data early in the scientific information lifecycle.","Pepe, Alberto;Mayernik, M.

It is an important problem since keywords are the basic elements for representing abstract objects such as documents, user profiles, topics and many things else. Our model is very effective since it combines four important factors in scientific publications: content, publicity, impact and randomness.

1502,"In many scientific fields, the order of coauthors on a paper conveys information about each individual's contribution to a piece of joint work. We argue that in prior network analyses of coauthorship networks, the information on ordering has been insufficiently considered because ties between authors are typically symmetrized. This is basically the same as assuming that each co-author has contributed equally to a paper. We introduce a solution to this problem by adopting a coauthorship credit allocation model proposed by Kim and Diesner (2014), which in its core conceptualizes co-authoring as a directed, weighted, and self-looped network. We test and validate our application of the adopted framework based on a sample data of 861 authors who have published in the journal Psychometrika. Results suggest that this novel sociometric approach can complement traditional measures based on undirected networks and expand insights into coauthoring patterns such as the hierarchy of collaboration among scholars. As another form of validation, we also show how our approach accurately detects prominent scholars in the Psychometric Society affiliated with the journal.","Kim, Jinseok;Diesner, Jana",ArXiv e-prints,4201071e72;554373a0af;X00ebb84b3;X023c75145;X048299ba0;X04e2ed0a5;X05a8a5d10;X066efb484;X09677d25f;X0b4fbf4d3;X0b559beb5;X0e54a64c9;X1205c64ff;X127911863;X1376b6435;X149003aa9;X14ea0e89c;X157505d67;X15b817b30;X1682847c6;X174e7000e;X18a3cc441;X1be0cf804;X1bfdacf27;X1d2aec6fa;X1fa4b15ae;X201ac27e8;X224bac08e;X227bfaecf;X23217f40a;X23d3c7580;X24d68c37f;X27460dfd7;X28acce4ff;X2b5aed85d;X2b7342c13;X2c3c84b45;X2d5ac6208;X2d71c3a69;X2e17b95af;X2f052bcd6;X2f41c0846;X3076e3673;X31f8fedc6;X321afe71a;X32725973c;X32e23c073;X34148c04c;X3564ec1e4;X38dbcfe67;X3a1f54526;X3b1df32dc;X3d843a54e;X3f2bf46bc;X415145385;X41b9064b8;X42b7256c8;X44eb344c1;X4531862f6;X45877e8c1;X47c338017;X47d37ebc6;X4885b3011;X48ad3152f;X491d70893;X4b6476189;X4dd6f436c;X4e3fa00bc;X4ff4aa954;X514f133d7;X540fb41b0;X550fadc40;X551bacf91;X585fd6173;X5a55d35f2;X5bb721b4f;X5d80d8586;X5e8ae6126;X5ec05bd23;X5edf9c5d1;X5ff4d245d;X612add547;X67d3b944e;X68487f4f0;X6861f88e7;X687d06ae9;X69beb7746;X6c5679f1f;X6c5d0c883;X6c6984b0a;X6cc9aec21;X6d0253601;X6f8a207d9;X6fc8ad2a9;X70d57816b;X75baaf6ac;X760883c51;X775e67102;X78dca00ea;X78f3f1285;X793d5102e;X79b11e4d4;X7a2f31c61;X7c83493fe;X7e6cad377;X812f003c3;X82b97e84b;X82e9960e6;X83edc4e91;X84f6f22c9;X8801474d7;X88626631e;X8afa48272;X8bba2ac35;X8d00d5071;X8e8abb199;X8f425ea69;X9002849db;X908b7704a;X916014bc6;X91ac56412;X91e30af27;X95537bc8f;X956e78961;X959950a9b;X961bb3d7a;X9796a47c6;X9d1be04b9;X9da2844fe;X9e68e9746;X9e6d6ef97;X9f1b14880;Xa0632ac37;Xa2f12213f;Xa636bf8f0;Xa659a8bc4;Xa71b6c120;Xa78f7abdb;Xa7f8814ab;Xa82d2fd79;Xab2b05b07;Xaf95f0a06;Xb2c3a92a2;Xb3588c6e9;Xb457229ee;Xb509fbf8f;Xb521fa7f8;Xb6c86657b;Xb7b920db6;Xb8da05ad9;Xb94560db2;Xbab961688;Xbd629a685;Xc01213e6e;Xc0342a229;Xc12ae956b;Xc30093a6d;Xc337aa09c;Xc61f9a9e4;Xc6c981b4d;Xc735f40cd;Xc8ccb6c55;Xccaf045da;Xccd88aa61;Xcf53d96ad;Xcf997d29d;Xd0a69351e;Xd0c88690d;Xd22bb8342;Xd40c87b37;Xd51d20eda;Xd87bca844;Xd9aef4921;Xd9b5e311b;Xd9c69cbc0;Xda0b1fc97;Xdccf9b140;Xdf226d1eb;Xe2b0d97eb;Xe659f09f5;Xe86ae63fb;Xea716ed30;Xeba197444;Xee979b0bf;Xefe9847b3;Xf14e17229;Xf239e4be8;Xf2517d8a2;Xf34921998;Xf434ad2c2;Xf6eb8a243;Xf886532e8;Xfa76ec4aa;Xfd2f50624;Xfd545238e;Xfe02ef20c;Xfe580b5e9;Xfe7fb6d71;Xfe9d1a76b;Xfee2f31ac;Xff4189165,201,Coauthorship networks: A directed network approach considering the order and number of coauthors,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00361,2015
1503,"Academic data sharing is a way for researchers to collaborate and thereby meet the needs of an increasingly complex research landscape. It enables researchers to verify results and to pursuit new research questions with ""old"" data. It is therefore not surprising that data sharing is advocated by funding agencies, journals, and researchers alike. We surveyed 2661 individual academic researchers across all disciplines on their dealings with data, their publication practices, and motives for sharing or withholding research data. The results for 1564 valid responses show that researchers across disciplines recognise the benefit of secondary research data for their own work and for scientific progress as a whole-still they only practice it in moderation. An explanation for this evidence could be an academic system that is not driven by monetary incentives, nor the desire for scientific progress, but by individual reputation-expressed in (high ranked journal) publications. We label this system a Reputation Economy. This special economy explains our findings that show that researchers have a nuanced idea how to provide adequate formal recognition for making data available to others-namely data citations. We conclude that data sharing will only be widely adopted among research professionals if sharing pays in form of reputation. Thus, policy measures that intend to foster research collaboration need to understand academia as a reputation economy. Successful measures must value intermediate products, such as research data, more highly than it is the case now.","Fecher, Benedikt;Friesike, Sascha;Hebing, Marcel;Linek, Stephanie;Sauermann, Armin",ArXiv e-prints,554624e0c4;X00bd80b2c;X01ffdcacd;X02e973683;X04af98486;X0517223e6;X0521f8067;X0552fb9a8;X05a8a5d10;X05c56ad03;X0600064af;X063504b0d;X066efb484;X06e7c87e4;X074915ae4;X0a31fdf09;X0b479a9ed;X0b559beb5;X0c0f6d8a3;X134996351;X15183a9d9;X158d13570;X169692bf4;X175d512ac;X18a3cc441;X18e36a2a6;X1b90e8f7f;X202473e0e;X228b850b4;X23217f40a;X28a64d4ba;X2b4ebe120;X2b5aed85d;X2b6caa025;X2f615d818;X3475a0dbd;X3539442ec;X35f031a9a;X37538c09f;X37718cf44;X38093820e;X38411e57a;X3b8f2a358;X3d8c2fa92;X3ebb18fd8;X3eff0c717;X3f4f9acb2;X403513c65;X40efd1b7e;X422656487;X424cfde17;X43b8e250b;X43e3ca186;X485841b1b;X49348c2de;X49c09d58d;X4a9f2c7ea;X4b6cb1b84;X4bcada76b;X4d878bb5c;X4e7d59ce1;X51b49d633;X5532a1d8f;X5a0f6b17f;X5a51ba639;X5cb802067;X5e4272229;X60af20a37;X60c2feee4;X6229c259f;X6314a8fdd;X65f415494;X674531e05;X687d06ae9;X6a1a064da;X6a39f29a6;X6dd83d689;X6f2ab6fb9;X6f860dc97;X6fc8ad2a9;X70202d4d6;X72128eccc;X74bb8e34e;X7661e0a47;X785946d53;X7accc69ad;X7b9626195;X7d200367d;X82132e406;X82690b573;X8278e028b;X855134ec9;X860f36d36;X861db377d;X8a308339d;X8a6337f04;X8be5e54a3;X90dd07739;X916014bc6;X9471c110f;X94b03f5d6;X95a7a77ff;X95d90c09c;X97979c957;X994e49168;X9e02d3a20;X9e476c6bc;X9e68e9746;Xa106f99ff;Xa27d9952b;Xa38082572;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa595ecc28;Xa60ea3d3b;Xa6a001ceb;Xa7236a26d;Xa7ac48fb2;Xa82d2fd79;Xa93e46b11;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xaa980c5f5;Xac95b4d16;Xaca514eaa;Xb177de509;Xb6112fcdb;Xb84dbcb43;Xb94560db2;Xb9ba70661;Xbb5355b43;Xbba488652;Xbd629a685;Xbdabe5336;Xbdc25cb20;Xbdd06ce92;Xbfd2aac12;Xc01213e6e;Xc12edd595;Xc1e562e7f;Xc23e3996c;Xc369f5355;Xc404e4da1;Xc4446e347;Xca77c97ea;Xcd91796db;Xce62babaa;Xcea593fa4;Xd00919346;Xd0ce640ba;Xd1fa353e6;Xd402e48cd;Xd47aa7829;Xd5e6d2650;Xd7bfd6c85;Xd90916859;Xd9c69cbc0;Xda380f1ea;Xda4103396;Xded34e55b;Xe1b387cff;Xe424afdea;Xe5b1182e5;Xeb9c3fb16;Xeba197444;Xec0589dbf;Xec9a77780;Xf01155cae;Xf16b99f14;Xf27f6ca8c;Xf34f4ac6d;Xf37bc712a;Xf434ad2c2;Xf808d0164;Xf8c2f6c12;Xf8f1f8040;Xfd38482f8;Xfd9408aeb;Xfe5981116;Xfe7fb6d71,178,A Reputation Economy: Results from an Empirical Survey on Academic Data Sharing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00481,2015
1504,"In this paper, we present an approach for analyzing the behavior of editors in the large current awareness service ""NEP: New Economics Papers"". We processed data from more than 38,000 issues derived from 90 different NEP reports over the past ten years. The aim of our analysis was to gain an inside to the editor behaviour when creating an issue and to look for factors that influence the success of a report. In our study we looked at the following features: average editing time, the average number of papers in an issue and the editor effort measured on presorted issues as relative search length (RSL). We found an average issue size of 12.4 documents per issue. The average editing time is rather low with 14.5 minute. We get to the point that the success of a report is mainly driven by its topic and the number of subscribers, as well as proactive action by the editor to promote the report in her community.","Carevic, Zeljko;Krichel, Thomas;Mayr, Philipp",ArXiv e-prints,X0552fb9a8;X05a8a5d10;X0654b4ce7;X07cab5ffd;X0c07e079e;X198792163;X1b4dd571b;X200e79523;X21e51d306;X2368a345e;X2916cb14e;X2b1e26a26;X2b5aed85d;X2c34a3d76;X2d4dd9caa;X2d5ac6208;X2ffee45cd;X30e6dd0e4;X31f8fedc6;X3317080ed;X34efeb9db;X35c3868db;X43e3ca186;X464f2207f;X47a0ff7ed;X49da14a90;X4e219d583;X515df4007;X51d210228;X56d5a6f02;X58aec828c;X59668eb44;X5cb802067;X5cf5fc891;X5dd25f284;X5e908a447;X6046d8f95;X60af20a37;X687d06ae9;X68db96647;X69df18bd7;X6a125b9a3;X6c6550413;X6e996bbc9;X6fa8de793;X71167ff1b;X744f04ea2;X75319ba5d;X75baaf6ac;X768091876;X777d9b03c;X78ccf6572;X79385eb59;X7b8722eb1;X7c985cf58;X7e5f230f8;X88626631e;X88b5fa40e;X88ea22a1b;X8a9bc5eb3;X8d1561656;X8d2be5deb;X931d6478d;X95520c812;X9718b8350;X9a662c7a5;X9af48e66e;X9c4449f74;X9c46fdb05;X9d02aaa76;X9d3d1b74a;X9e68e9746;Xa27d9952b;Xa3bd609a7;Xa3cfebaf8;Xa82d2fd79;Xad3a60751;Xb25d5c6b3;Xb625c5d3e;Xb7b920db6;Xb7f85153c;Xb912e1b53;Xbb89f45f5;Xbd629a685;Xc03645464;Xc337aa09c;Xc5fa37254;Xc7bb4cff6;Xcae784ec4;Xcb283bd5b;Xcce62715c;Xcddea854a;Xcf17b9f95;Xd00ddc803;Xd1f30b564;Xd457d1112;Xd561656d4;Xd58da2799;Xd97f05818;Xd9c69cbc0;Xd9f666bac;Xdb6559cc3;Xdfb0e78ae;Xe039afa38;Xe283bda23;Xe47272522;Xe5c1eb49b;Xe87a38485;Xe9b921562;Xed8bff0a8;Xee7df7f8d;Xef37f56c5;Xf0e610de9;Xf2517d8a2;Xf8b755325;Xfd74d0109,116,Assessing a human mediated current awareness service,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01082,2015
1505,"The IMPACT-es diachronic corpus of historical Spanish compiles over one hundred books --containing approximately 8 million words-- in addition to a complementary lexicon which links more than 10 thousand lemmas with attestations of the different variants found in the documents. This textual corpus and the accompanying lexicon have been released under an open license (Creative Commons by-nc-sa) in order to permit their intensive exploitation in linguistic research. Approximately 7% of the words in the corpus (a selection aimed at enhancing the coverage of the most frequent word forms) have been annotated with their lemma, part of speech, and modern equivalent. This paper describes the annotation criteria followed and the standards, based on the Text Encoding Initiative recommendations, used to the represent the texts in digital form. As an illustration of the possible synergies between diachronic textual resources and linguistic research, we describe the application of statistical machine translation techniques to infer probabilistic context-sensitive rules for the automatic modernisation of spelling. The automatic modernisation with this type of statistical methods leads to very low character error rates when the output is compared with the supervised modern version of the text.","Sánchez-Martínez, Felipe;Martínez-Sempere, Isabel;Ivars-Ribes, Xavier;Carrasco, Rafael C.",ArXiv e-prints,X1fc447bb3;X2cbaeaf78;X39950d2d3;X4bd3837d9;X51e341467;X5b381b24a;X67dfbdd0f;X757722468;X78544abde;X7f95bf70d;X8a4cd1adc;X91a311e11;X95a2e948a;X9e71fed94;Xa5972aaa9;Xaa2ac03b2;Xadd75ad04;Xb20c03df5;Xb226569b5;Xb75e3ba87;Xbd71c7706;Xc21d4089b;Xc272433ed;Xc546f0e2b;Xca8ef3b2d;Xcd436814d;Xe5c021d97;Xe9dede57f;Xea5ce4d72;Xf801a10ee;Xfe514e66f,31,An open diachronic corpus of historical Spanish: annotation criteria and automatic modernisation of spelling,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3692,2013
1506,"This is the second paper in a series of bibliometric studies of research data. In this paper, we present an analysis of figshare, one of the largest multidisciplinary repositories for research materials to date. We analysed the structure of items archived in figshare, their usage, and their reception in two altmetrics sources (PlumX and ImpactStory). We found that figshare acts as a platform for newly published research materials, and as an archive for PLOS. Depending on the function, we found different bibliometric characteristics. Items archived from PLOS tend to be coming from the natural sciences and are often unviewed and non-downloaded. Self-archived items, however, come from a variety of disciplines and exhibit some patterns of higher usage. In the altmetrics analysis, we found that Twitter was the social media service where research data gained most attention; generally, research data published in 2014 were most popular across social media services. PlumX detects considerably more items in social media and also finds higher altmetric scores than ImpactStory.","Kraker, Peter;Lex, Elisabeth;Gorraiz, Juan;Gumpenberger, Christian;Peters, Isabella",ArXiv e-prints,5506ee4bcc;X015da91e1;X03820728d;X048299ba0;X04f87fb9d;X05a8a5d10;X062cecc9f;X0679cf648;X06ea06f8a;X06ebb7b13;X094a37927;X0a31fdf09;X0de9b82d4;X0f89d0f83;X10c833095;X118da85cc;X12fd3e922;X15183a9d9;X1546ec534;X16c179d20;X16f74039e;X175d2f91d;X17d0b802a;X19338a1b4;X19bac776e;X1b428b7a5;X1bfdacf27;X1ffca35fb;X21e51d306;X22ea7a542;X2630f904e;X26f239059;X28c96f2a2;X2b5aed85d;X2bb09881e;X2c4f74bf2;X2e21b0c22;X2f615d818;X3475a0dbd;X350d251f3;X35f031a9a;X374bc5df6;X378dcc7b1;X37a706f40;X37e2f1061;X39e72362e;X3c56dd794;X3d7a244b0;X3d8d414c0;X3e82245a3;X3ebb18fd8;X3f1f569a5;X3fdc2083d;X44bd6d935;X455e85347;X46c39dcee;X4879ac23e;X4a173c41a;X4a569505b;X4a615c4d3;X4e1809577;X502e79b4f;X5095ef3e9;X5109d0f8f;X52197077e;X536f61ddb;X53daf67b1;X55458f9c9;X56d5a6f02;X580c6c903;X5868b22ef;X589897f15;X5961c4646;X5a51ba639;X5aa8e8753;X5b6414238;X5cb802067;X5dd25f284;X5e8ae6126;X635e2beb2;X65f3233b4;X66b8eed63;X670dcdcaa;X673dfccd0;X674531e05;X67741f5a0;X678e40acf;X67a531590;X68ffcb4e5;X69df18bd7;X6a11c33a9;X6a1a40228;X6a1befd48;X6bcb62bdc;X6c74a1aa2;X6e83523ad;X6ebf95612;X6f8a207d9;X71a893532;X722cb4828;X745da96bf;X750765624;X75319ba5d;X7533056a9;X7593840b9;X75baaf6ac;X770e26570;X78f42363c;X791f67cae;X7a0725216;X7f37d8cd1;X7fce1fbef;X800f20cd7;X82690b573;X82b6299dd;X848eef912;X85646c721;X86a33483e;X8972ba11a;X8a0d17851;X8bf74aeba;X91ff33ccb;X93d1e637c;X94ba7afb2;X9594e30f7;X9660c73cc;X9718b8350;X975ac1617;X978955336;X9827d7f9c;X98fd46db9;X994fcad80;X9af48e66e;X9ccd2ae97;X9d8cb8ae1;X9e68e9746;X9f146c06a;X9fc5827a4;Xa00524190;Xa19e210b1;Xa1cbbcf4a;Xa1edeb7e9;Xa2224b2a6;Xa30230692;Xa616afcff;Xa6c1e1f69;Xa7fc1c148;Xa82d2fd79;Xa868b50eb;Xa9036225d;Xab43df38f;Xab5d106b7;Xaca9e7a45;Xadadce91f;Xb02081693;Xb04635254;Xb06aa336d;Xb07775167;Xb0b6151d7;Xb137a26e5;Xb4ff11b84;Xb54736c05;Xb6b31ee28;Xb86bdf63c;Xb9044c067;Xb912e1b53;Xbd629a685;Xbdd6d9066;Xbe834b3e4;Xc01213e6e;Xc26c91176;Xc369f5355;Xc6b8fa295;Xc7bb4cff6;Xc89fe9585;Xc8ccb6c55;Xcae784ec4;Xcb0564684;Xcb60787c4;Xcb6c2cdfc;Xd00ddc803;Xd1abe56a7;Xd1fbf5824;Xd2aee4a34;Xd2af5bce4;Xd3a4b8489;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdb2c3b1c7;Xded34e55b;Xe53a1cde5;Xe5518ec13;Xe74e13c9d;Xeb0a739b5;Xeb6cf458f;Xec9a77780;Xef37f56c5;Xef4c0cf26;Xf017f3002;Xf16ec38f0;Xf52efcf4f;Xf5a83abcf;Xf7626990a;Xf808d0164;Xf8b755325;Xf8f2a56eb;Xf8fb72f9d;Xf994b7bc0;Xfc3624d25;Xfcb0c1ebd;Xff4189165,210,Research Data Explored II: the Anatomy and Reception of figshare,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01298,2015
1507,"The evaluation of journals based on their influence is of interest for numerous reasons. Various methods of computing a score have been proposed for measuring the scientific influence of scholarly journals. Typically the computation of any of these scores involves compiling the citation information pertaining to the journal under consideration. This involves significant overhead since the article citation information of not only the journal under consideration but also that of other journals for the recent few years need to be stored. Our work is motivated by the idea of developing a computationally lightweight approach that does not require any data storage, yet yields a score which is useful for measuring the importance of journals. In this paper, a regression analysis based method is proposed to calculate Journal Influence Score. Proposed model is validated using historical data from the SCImago portal. The results show that the error is small between rankings obtained using the proposed method and the SCImago Journal Rank, thus proving that the proposed approach is a feasible and effective method of calculating scientific impact of journals.","Saha, Snehanshu;Jangid, Neelam;MN, Anand;Gupta, Sidhant",ArXiv e-prints,X00fa7a190;X0182df0dd;X03cfa2565;X05cb3a7a3;X06ebb7b13;X0b559beb5;X13a1d78ce;X15f0c021a;X185381ea5;X1d129f497;X254296f82;X258f767fa;X299cf3488;X2ad4c5c23;X2b5aed85d;X2c6fd1860;X2d297c2c7;X32eba8410;X3b290a086;X3dc589d91;X3e82245a3;X4a2d47537;X536f61ddb;X55458f9c9;X557d8b8d0;X563d992d9;X59437fbf0;X5aa8e8753;X5b21b2555;X64344bb9b;X689577a0b;X69df18bd7;X6a11c33a9;X745da96bf;X784f378cf;X78dca00ea;X7d981aa5e;X7e6cad377;X7f45548a8;X7f4aef04f;X835dd36c8;X876271947;X8cec38e51;X91ff33ccb;X973bce71d;X98d9b4992;X9ddb45e1a;X9e68e9746;Xa630f227a;Xa7fad295a;Xa82d2fd79;Xad3a60751;Xb2f5896f7;Xb9044c067;Xbd629a685;Xbdd6d9066;Xc01213e6e;Xc7bb4cff6;Xc83a68a65;Xc89c3ce36;Xd11fc2586;Xd1817f779;Xd2af5bce4;Xd3653a029;Xd3a4b8489;Xd7fe61b41;Xd9c69cbc0;Xde1606e6b;Xe4823fd21;Xe80aa7740;Xe8d8d6d71;Xea7084546;Xef358bcbe;Xef37f56c5;Xf40739052;Xf7293fe32;Xf90be6331,77,Journal rank in the Science and Technology domain: A lightweight quantitative approach for evaluation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01380,2015
1508,"The structure of the total technology space, together with the specialized knowledge positions of the inventors, companies and countries, conditions the prospect of their next innovations. Prior studies have proposed representing the technology space as a network of patent technology classes connected by links weighted according to their relatedness. Although the choice of relatedness measures affects the structure of the resulting networks, such measures have not been assessed in terms of their influences on network structures. In this paper, we first present six measures based on the similarity of knowledge bases of different technology fields and, alternatively, on the likelihood for inventors, organizations or countries to diversify across technology fields. Then, we compare the resulting networks in terms of network structures, vertex and edge properties and their predictability on the importance of the represented technology fields. Based on USPTO patent data from 1976 to 2010 and International Patent Classification, our results suggest that the technology space is almost fully but heterogeneously connected, with extremely weak relatedness between most pairs of technology classes, that is consistent in different types of networks. Our results also suggest that networks using co-reference and inventor diversification likelihood to relate technology fields are strongly correlated with each other, are relatively more correlated with other types of networks, and provide the strongest correlations between network centrality measures of the vertices and the importance of the represented technology fields. These two types of technology networks may be most useful for general network analysis on how the structure of the technology space conditions the search for inventions of different agents.","Yan, Bowen;Luo, Jianxi",ArXiv e-prints,553d4cc76f;X00bd80b2c;X01ffdcacd;X0396bc076;X03fbf6199;X04714dfbc;X048299ba0;X04929e07f;X0496431d5;X050767ff6;X05a8a5d10;X0654b4ce7;X0654dd947;X06fe614a4;X07cab5ffd;X087002339;X08e473f7f;X0aab974fb;X0b559beb5;X0bb577a13;X0bdbc5f80;X0cbb8b974;X0e2adfb5b;X0eff2e406;X1181649e5;X119683aca;X11f065e8e;X12da4409e;X12e3ffd83;X137a1b030;X13ab44e73;X13f1bf67b;X150eef9ae;X1584e1557;X15b817b30;X1601008b6;X1682847c6;X17399c0a2;X174fb7d90;X175830d57;X184243b0a;X18d7177e8;X190ddf08e;X192961649;X1977a4ead;X1989f9a30;X1b399dc87;X1b428b7a5;X1c65736ee;X1ca5a6eac;X1cceb2dce;X1e3a4b068;X210d4914c;X2120cd521;X23311a8ff;X23b88ea94;X23d3c7580;X23daab986;X23e8900af;X2549ac092;X28db049fa;X2909932d6;X2916cb14e;X2ada9ee85;X2b5aed85d;X2c0ef526c;X2ca0d3fbf;X2d5ac6208;X2dd1d040e;X2e17b95af;X2ff674135;X30e6dd0e4;X3127d050f;X3393026f2;X33db5f5b9;X343b18780;X354db9643;X3564ec1e4;X35c3868db;X35f031a9a;X362e60f42;X372eb3bab;X379fcb58a;X383bb7dd2;X396fa975c;X39873c8a3;X39a8cac2d;X39dfe0f6d;X3a2cbfa19;X3b290a086;X3eb96fb85;X3ff0e8520;X403513c65;X40ea1e186;X41a746f87;X43e069cc9;X43e3ca186;X47c338017;X47d55e2d5;X483ace24a;X48fd0b3ca;X491d70893;X497af27a1;X4aaff7538;X4b66d36fa;X4c260374a;X4c902bc4c;X4dbd4c75a;X4fd05ab08;X502b7d563;X5054c41e5;X51d210228;X52197077e;X521c2e83a;X539b827f8;X54ac6986c;X54c1312b2;X55fb127ca;X577ab22d2;X57cc916d1;X583ffbc56;X597fc42b5;X59c362c1f;X59d2da3cd;X5b4ec8106;X5b5ac73f9;X5bfe6fc61;X5d1dfcbb1;X5dee7d435;X5e80b7edb;X5e8ae6126;X5ee7aa98c;X5f7fbb2be;X5fdceb6bb;X5ff974c5b;X616c1bcb6;X6270efe53;X63fa8e323;X643218581;X66577b280;X669be64e4;X66bb520fa;X66f894496;X677456b52;X67af3b894;X685532f1f;X6861f88e7;X68a71e471;X68db96647;X6918db166;X69cf83209;X69df18bd7;X6a12b0e36;X6ae3d55ee;X6b1bece72;X6c5d0c883;X6cd9e0fa5;X6dab086dc;X6ddd04bd3;X6eea8c5d6;X6fe3a4f1e;X6fe9cd43e;X6feb5403b;X70330ec44;X711020fc7;X7158ae876;X716ec96de;X717e2b595;X72d9e54fc;X75fa94740;X777d9b03c;X77c1c9e2b;X780bb1da7;X78500393a;X788ae16a0;X78975016e;X78d6c882d;X78dca00ea;X78f3f1285;X7a2f31c61;X7a845f901;X7ab6cfcee;X7b9a520a7;X7bc467d40;X7be5628ae;X7d92dd203;X7e14d41b6;X7e2e23a54;X7f4011c2c;X7f4aef04f;X80c152d16;X8123b5d5b;X815a20c3a;X82b0904d4;X8306935ed;X850fefd78;X857dd65c4;X86f61eda8;X87e2df74a;X88ea22a1b;X88f962c12;X8aaed611c;X8afa48272;X8b5f3d668;X8b7df2537;X8badf08b0;X8bba2ac35;X8c446fdca;X8e091d525;X8fc8408bc;X9002ddb0d;X908b7704a;X910cc919a;X933c74132;X939a1c9a9;X943d540b5;X94878d1fa;X956f1a876;X959950a9b;X9666c428c;X96bf8020d;X9746d7a86;X9796a47c6;X9809008ec;X99976a38a;X99c79441b;X9a0a0345a;X9a1890aa0;X9b44255a1;X9c4449f74;X9cf148b73;X9e6d6ef97;X9f5eb6ab1;Xa013b3478;Xa0bc84a7e;Xa1965c29a;Xa1baae54b;Xa29645bd7;Xa2a26e078;Xa30230692;Xa3d2ed32f;Xa58d7769e;Xa636bf8f0;Xa659a8bc4;Xa65a25bb6;Xa71b6c120;Xa7a45577d;Xa82a3882d;Xa82d2fd79;Xa8607ecb9;Xa8d777495;Xa96de17aa;Xa9e7a1a7f;Xaa9742ab4;Xabd079e86;Xabdb4ab9b;Xac8f624e0;Xad21de63f;Xae64c797e;Xae7ab9ee4;Xae9523826;Xaef590431;Xb061ec840;Xb2c3a92a2;Xb2f841d2b;Xb334f3d88;Xb3a7fe885;Xb414e596f;Xb434989a9;Xb56db48f0;Xb6fc8f8a3;Xb7b920db6;Xb80a461a1;Xb80cf4279;Xb94560db2;Xb9b9e43e8;Xba0e69937;Xba1165642;Xbab961688;Xbabc5f973;Xbafc34de8;Xbbe8c9201;Xbcd63cc5a;Xbd629a685;Xbddf7d351;Xbde2153e9;Xbe2eaa6e6;Xbf6197462;Xbf65e2b27;Xc0342a229;Xc08258fae;Xc1aa53b4b;Xc1f9c856b;Xc20d562d1;Xc2516125f;Xc2879ca14;Xc2971c6e0;Xc30093a6d;Xc598b2f28;Xc8633a2f4;Xc8e344885;Xca4e7d475;Xcab254363;Xcd3b3de8a;Xcf53d96ad;Xcfe2ce463;Xd00ddc803;Xd06c4cabf;Xd0c88690d;Xd1b04eed2;Xd2aef61c8;Xd3c704e1f;Xd46a71cd4;Xd4eeb7116;Xd716d48db;Xd75645588;Xd7745946b;Xd7fe61b41;Xd8cbe1063;Xd90a62ce2;Xd9c69cbc0;Xda0b1fc97;Xda123577c;Xdc2dbe278;Xdc9e9c3b0;Xdd71f026b;Xdeb9b03df;Xdec3a2817;Xdf2c9211c;Xe023ad3ee;Xe100a53fc;Xe2b1f71c1;Xe2c058c6d;Xe2f6fb596;Xe32b5ac55;Xe51e869bc;Xe54ba3453;Xe5697cfb1;Xe5b1182e5;Xe6f645a62;Xe766433ce;Xe7729eb64;Xe8c22cb8a;Xe8f3f718e;Xea646e902;Xeaae9f06f;Xeba197444;Xebd8d5d99;Xec0e9654f;Xecd4fa3e7;Xed1441944;Xed6113525;Xed8bdddd9;Xed933f01c;Xeeb63b9f0;Xf205e9a99;Xf3565b0ef;Xf3cdc04ea;Xf3d091937;Xf4104e4a3;Xf430a29dd;Xf4ba2cc52;Xf5a83abcf;Xf63d849a3;Xf65ffea35;Xf711eb434;Xf729add4e;Xf73c9043e;Xf8582b95b;Xf8f2a56eb;Xf8fb72f9d;Xf91de4556;Xf96c9b21d;Xf9e12b166;Xfa241e6c9;Xfab5d9546;Xfad158c7f;Xfafa5f1f3;Xfb153337e;Xfba3d1cbb;Xfc06cb359;Xfcb0c1ebd;Xfd8e8aa96;Xfe2ae38b3;Xfe7fb6d71;Xfe979c191;Xff4189165;Xff59fb28e;Xffcf6433f;Xffe673a86,390,Network Maps of Technology Fields: How Measures of Relatedness Influence Network Structures,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02373,2015
1509,"Criticism of the conference model should be put in context. Evidences suggest that the essential features of this model have emerged as responses to challenges posed by current trends of scientific research and the impact of the new techno-economic paradigm, the age of Information and Communication Technology. This context seems indispensable when discussing today's problems of scientific evaluation, in particular the Conference vs. Journal (CvJ) debate. This debate, also, would benefit from systematic historical and sociological studies of these practices. In this note we briefly develop these arguments.","Gutierrez, Claudio",ArXiv e-prints,4b79552d07;54f6fc3365;X0067972df;X058aa6b6e;X0b559beb5;X0da4af694;X11b53836e;X123ff3045;X169692bf4;X175e4abd3;X19420e4e4;X1b6df7c87;X246a783c7;X267f0903b;X2748d40e1;X299cf3488;X2a077f892;X2b0da2380;X2b5aed85d;X2d5617bfd;X320fa5a59;X34110efab;X36694fceb;X39e87e148;X3da93ff3e;X408ad8ebe;X40c57f4bc;X44bd6d935;X46de5627c;X48a77c0d1;X48bafa6eb;X54477d2c0;X549e8a565;X5532a1d8f;X55b493aa6;X569612660;X585695785;X585fd6173;X5dee7d435;X66013d41d;X671db9e2b;X689577a0b;X69df18bd7;X6d67ce964;X70074cffa;X74013eb80;X7478c6a43;X74b0e03e1;X74fcfa7f7;X750765624;X7652b69d9;X78dca00ea;X79b11e4d4;X7b9a520a7;X7da73b7ba;X7f4aef04f;X82e1a0516;X875783253;X961bb3d7a;X98b82186f;X9b853e20a;X9ce96e79d;X9d91a0fde;Xa2224b2a6;Xa43e23b35;Xa82d2fd79;Xa989e5d6c;Xaad1442c1;Xad3a60751;Xb5a5a2db1;Xbd629a685;Xbe428ba1c;Xc128950b9;Xc369f5355;Xc723807c1;Xcb6c2cdfc;Xcf997d29d;Xd0dd9e68f;Xd2422a5f5;Xd7fe61b41;Xd9c69cbc0;Xdb7532427;Xdbb2dec91;Xdf2c9211c;Xdf5a1bfff;Xe06b658e6;Xe20b907d5;Xe39a41c30;Xeaae9f06f;Xeced1d05c;Xf2169dbac;Xf265ba46b;Xf90444b99;Xf91de4556;Xfce5eecbf;Xfdf2a868b,96,Conferences vs. Journals: Throwing the baby out with the bath water?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01960,2015
1510,"Collaborative tagging has been quickly gaining ground because of its ability to recruit the activity of web users into effectively organizing and sharing vast amounts of information. Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag co-occurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory - or aging of resources - in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features, with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users, who - despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity - appear to follow simple activity patterns.","Cattuto, C.;Loreto, V.;Pietronero, L.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,X051a7a766;X0659f63c5;X11637598e;X15f5e85af;X216cf3ca8;X24b68be80;X362553515;X3674def92;X3a0e2dfed;X4401b1f98;X46c1db474;X4c2b1a09b;X606a96bca;X653ae0b0d;X71f0701f4;X723ae5bb4;X7e04b9b30;X812bc3182;X971c5f21f;Xa13842853;Xa53c1ea38;Xc12b7b028;Xc3687f5fc;Xc814bcd8d;Xc870e60d3;Xcafa07649;Xd147ef247;Xd90d1d157;Xdc0457d06;Xdc6ebf7e5;Xddbb49b72;Xf59b1512e;Xf892df090;Xfbdffdaee;Xfc628894f;Xfe38d5ab7,36,From the Cover: Semiotic dynamics and collaborative tagging,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605015,2007
1511,"The exponential growth in the number of scientific papers makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to keep track of all the publications relevant to their work. Consequently, the attention that can be devoted to individual papers, measured by their citation counts, is bound to decay rapidly. In this work we make a thorough study of the life-cycle of papers in different disciplines. Typically, the citation rate of a paper increases up to a few years after its publication, reaches a peak and then decreases rapidly. This decay can be described by an exponential or a power law behavior, as in ultradiffusive processes, with exponential fitting better than power law for the majority of cases. The decay is also becoming faster over the years, signaling that nowadays papers are forgotten more quickly. However, when time is counted in terms of the number of published papers, the rate of decay of citations is fairly independent of the period considered.
