0,"In this paper, we study the generation of maximal Poisson-disk sets with varying radii. First, we present a geometric analysis of gaps in such disk sets. This analysis is the basis for maximal and adaptive sampling in Euclidean space and on manifolds. Second, we propose efficient algorithms and data structures to detect gaps and update gaps when disks are inserted, deleted, moved, or have their radius changed. We build on the concepts of the regular triangulation and the power diagram. Third, we will show how our analysis can make a contribution to the state-of-the-art in surface remeshing.","Yan, Dong-Ming;Wonka, Peter",ArXiv e-prints,"[X38bf78042, X39acf7a59, X519c43872, X5b0e987df, X83a2988dc, X8db9f7c43, X9b896f12d, Xa92b9871f, Xa9d8ee926, Xc7c2ba706, Xf99cd6f97]",X38bf78042;X39acf7a59;X519c43872;X5b0e987df;X83a2988dc;X8db9f7c43;X9b896f12d;Xa92b9871f;Xa9d8ee926;Xc7c2ba706;Xf99cd6f97,11,Gap Processing for Adaptive Maximal Poisson-Disk Sampling,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3297,2012
1,"Registration, which aims to find an optimal 1-1 correspondence between shapes, is an important process in different research areas. Conformal mappings have been widely used to obtain a diffeomorphism between shapes that minimizes angular distortion. Conformal registrations are beneficial since it preserves the local geometry well. However, when landmark constraints are enforced, conformal mappings generally do not exist. This motivates us to look for a unique landmark matching quasi-conformal registration, which minimizes the conformality distortion. Under suitable condition on the landmark constraints, a unique diffeomporphism, called the Teichm\""uller extremal mapping between two surfaces can be obtained, which minimizes the maximal conformality distortion. In this paper, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm, called the Quasi-conformal (QC) iterations, to compute the Teichm\""uller mapping. The basic idea is to represent the set of diffeomorphisms using Beltrami coefficients (BCs), and look for an optimal BC associated to the desired Teichm\""uller mapping. The associated diffeomorphism can be efficiently reconstructed from the optimal BC using the Linear Beltrami Solver(LBS). Using BCs to represent diffeomorphisms guarantees the diffeomorphic property of the registration. Using our proposed method, the Teichm\""uller mapping can be accurately and efficiently computed within 10 seconds. The obtained registration is guaranteed to be bijective. The proposed algorithm can also be extended to compute Teichm\""uller mapping with soft landmark constraints. We applied the proposed algorithm to real applications, such as brain landmark matching registration, constrained texture mapping and human face registration. Experimental results shows that our method is both effective and efficient in computing a non-overlap landmark matching registration with least amount of conformality distortion.","Lui, Lok Ming;Lam, Ka Chun;Yau, Shing-Tung;Gu, Xianfeng",ArXiv e-prints,"[X08ededf9b, X20e8f0132, X47364abb4, X5c5e770d0, X756a15580, Xa647ecffa, Xb58c8c2a4, Xb6f852c53, Xbbd207dfc, Xd758254ae, Xe11fa1858, Xe8c4f1d9a, Xf21662da9]",X08ededf9b;X20e8f0132;X47364abb4;X5c5e770d0;X756a15580;Xa647ecffa;Xb58c8c2a4;Xb6f852c53;Xbbd207dfc;Xd758254ae;Xe11fa1858;Xe8c4f1d9a;Xf21662da9,13,"Teichm\""uller extremal mapping and its applications to landmark matching registration",http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2569,2012
2,"We present a high-performance, graphics processing unit (GPU) based framework for the efficient analysis and visualization of (nearly) terabyte (TB) sized 3D images. Using a cluster of 96 GPUs, we demonstrate for a 0.5 TB image (1) volume rendering using an arbitrary transfer function at 7-10 frames per second, (2) computation of basic global image statistics such as the mean intensity and standard deviation in 1.7 s, (3) evaluation of the image histogram in 4 s and (4) evaluation of the global image median intensity in just 45 s. Our measured results correspond to a raw computational throughput approaching 1 teravoxel per second, and are 10-100 times faster than the best possible performance with traditional single-node, multi-core CPU implementations. A scalability analysis shows that the framework will scale well to images sized 1 TB and beyond. Other parallel data analysis algorithms can be added to the framework with relative ease, and accordingly we present our framework as a possible solution to the image analysis and visualization requirements of next-generation telescopes, including the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder radio telescopes.","Hassan, A.

3,"Graphics processing units (GPUs) are gaining widespread use in computational chemistry and other scientific simulation contexts because of their huge performance advantages relative to conventional CPUs. However, the reliability of GPUs in error-intolerant applications is largely unproven. In particular, a lack of error checking and correcting (ECC) capability in the memory subsystems of graphics cards has been cited as a hindrance to the acceptance of GPUs as high-performance coprocessors, but the impact of this design has not been previously quantified. In this article we present MemtestG80, our software for assessing memory error rates on NVIDIA G80 and GT200-architecture-based graphics cards. Furthermore, we present the results of a large-scale assessment of GPU error rate, conducted by running MemtestG80 on over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home distributed computing network. Our control experiments on consumer-grade and dedicated-GPGPU hardware in a controlled environment found no errors. However, our survey over cards on Folding@home finds that, in their installed environments, two-thirds of tested GPUs exhibit a detectable, pattern-sensitive rate of memory soft errors. We demonstrate that these errors persist after controlling for overclocking and environmental proxies for temperature, but depend strongly on board architecture.","Haque, Imran S.;Pande, Vijay S.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X08d41fac0, X0ec34cb0d, X0fac0db83, X1b528bdb4, X1f8f2bdb2, X202438963, X21a0d1927, X2644da74d, X42d92f90e, X45937137e, X4678028ff, X4863dc699, X4da2ee4e4, X5429dd7fc, X5ae38116b, X5dd52073d, X649620b02, X65a7e0b26, X6a510bc56, X6fb4a1afa, X71278febe, X712ee9103, X75c7155d3, X7dee6ba17, X882684daf, X9029c7e74, X96ec5cb0a, X99af0e13b, X99d082167, X9a7b9c208, X9fae16ba5, Xa157e1471, Xac75f43ab, Xafddf0504, Xbba05cc8d, Xbfdffe722, Xc45a86080, Xc60597252, Xc7948c386, Xcafb98091, Xcafc23691, Xd219f40cb, Xd8458ed17, Xdfc10c591, Xf934e0ecc]",X08d41fac0;X0ec34cb0d;X0fac0db83;X1b528bdb4;X1f8f2bdb2;X202438963;X21a0d1927;X2644da74d;X42d92f90e;X45937137e;X4678028ff;X4863dc699;X4da2ee4e4;X5429dd7fc;X5ae38116b;X5dd52073d;X649620b02;X65a7e0b26;X6a510bc56;X6fb4a1afa;X71278febe;X712ee9103;X75c7155d3;X7dee6ba17;X882684daf;X9029c7e74;X96ec5cb0a;X99af0e13b;X99d082167;X9a7b9c208;X9fae16ba5;Xa157e1471;Xac75f43ab;Xafddf0504;Xbba05cc8d;Xbfdffe722;Xc45a86080;Xc60597252;Xc7948c386;Xcafb98091;Xcafc23691;Xd219f40cb;Xd8458ed17;Xdfc10c591;Xf934e0ecc,45,Hard Data on Soft Errors: A Large-Scale Assessment of Real-World Error Rates in GPGPU,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0505,2009
4,"We consider the problem of finding a color scale which performs well when converted to a grayscale. We assume that each color is converted to a shade of gray with the same intensity as the color. We also assume that the color scales have a linear variation of intensity and hue, and find scales which maximize the average chroma (or ""colorfulness"") of the colors. We find two classes of solutions, which traverse the color wheel in opposite directions. The two classes of scales start with hues near cyan and red. The average chroma of the scales are 65-77% those of the pure colors.","Alben, Silas",ArXiv e-prints,"[X3488b5060, X60f45fa6c, X7570689a1, Xc6fd424ac, Xccb36999f, Xda9e715ee]",X3488b5060;X60f45fa6c;X7570689a1;Xc6fd424ac;Xccb36999f;Xda9e715ee,6,Color scales that are effective in both color and grayscale,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3659,2012
5,"We develop a class of new kinetic data structures for collision detection between moving convex polytopes; the performance of these structures is sensitive to the separation of the polytopes during their motion. For two convex polygons in the plane, let $D$ be the maximum diameter of the polygons, and let $s$ be the minimum distance between them during their motion. Our separation certificate changes $O(\log(D/s))$ times when the relative motion of the two polygons is a translation along a straight line or convex curve, $O(\sqrt{D/s})$ for translation along an algebraic trajectory, and $O(D/s)$ for algebraic rigid motion (translation and rotation). Each certificate update is performed in $O(\log(D/s))$ time. Variants of these data structures are also shown that exhibit \emph{hysteresis}---after a separation certificate fails, the new certificate cannot fail again until the objects have moved by some constant fraction of their current separation. We can then bound the number of events by the combinatorial size of a certain cover of the motion path by balls.","Erickson, Jeff;Guibas, Leonidas J.;Stolfi, Jorge;Zhang, Li",ArXiv e-prints,"[X38e1db92e, X5789b2a77, Xf3d4a9195]",X38e1db92e;X5789b2a77;Xf3d4a9195,3,Separation-Sensitive Collision Detection for Convex Objects,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9809035,1998
6,"Facial emotion expression for virtual characters is used in a wide variety of areas. Often, the primary reason to use emotion expression is not to study emotion expression generation per se, but to use emotion expression in an application or research project. What is then needed is an easy to use and flexible, but also validated mechanism to do so. In this report we present such a mechanism. It enables developers to build virtual characters with dynamic affective facial expressions. The mechanism is based on Facial Action Coding. It is easy to implement, and code is available for download. To show the validity of the expressions generated with the mechanism we tested the recognition accuracy for 6 basic emotions (joy, anger, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear) and 4 blend emotions (enthusiastic, furious, frustrated, and evil). Additionally we investigated the effect of VC distance (z-coordinate), the effect of the VC's face morphology (male vs. female), the effect of a lateral versus a frontal presentation of the expression, and the effect of intensity of the expression. Participants (n=19, Western and Asian subjects) rated the intensity of each expression for each condition (within subject setup) in a non forced choice manner. All of the basic emotions were uniquely perceived as such. Further, the blends and confusion details of basic emotions are compatible with findings in psychology.","Broekens, Joost;Qu, Chao;Brinkman, Willem-Paul",ArXiv e-prints,"[4a6d2f8543, X004191a4f, X00eeb32a4, X02f309050, X045974c9b, X0e267ff8c, X13883edda, X16964cdc3, X246d4fa15, X2779cbdfd, X2a9701de5, X2b756833a, X30cb60d58, X31b6b140f, X32ef44f44, X353836f41, X37d146733, X396eb7973, X4157e801c, X426544550, X44496bd91, X470b003c2, X4bbdf1dfd, X4ca9a07b6, X500f768d7, X5075233c7, X523925a7d, X5298e035f, X5599890b0, X587b1d98b, X58dac4017, X5a3f6d17a, X5b50c8758, X64d4f135e, X67ab76f9b, X686fbf448, X6918db166, X696daaa44, X6bccaa078, X6fe20cb7e, X756fb7c83, X7b2d20ad8, X7b43f4714, X7f8ea8b3a, X85ddb005a, X8cd6cdb44, X8f14776cd, X92eb38ae3, X9772c87c3, X97a0ceb88, X97d6bf6c2, X97debf7bd, X993793745, X9ae6eefa5, X9cb668f84, X9d4e09cce, Xa00677465, Xa18224528, Xa24633a3c, Xa367db923, Xa43e23b35, Xa5cac42ef, Xa7f5a7d47, Xab09d43f1, Xadf9da05e, Xae8c57816, Xb1f4fe02e, Xb244291b8, Xb3040917d, Xb879656a4, Xba6f9bb0f, Xbca1f79e4, Xbd0ce1b52, Xbd41f5e14, Xbf2334a3f, Xbf89e779c, Xc118e0e26, Xd29326954, Xd84ff8e16, Xda76927d3, Xe19d1656e, Xe34179240, Xea4a82289, Xeb43546e7, Xed446c45e, Xf1ebd4195, Xf234ed166, Xf500ef3fa]",4a6d2f8543;X004191a4f;X00eeb32a4;X02f309050;X045974c9b;X0e267ff8c;X13883edda;X16964cdc3;X246d4fa15;X2779cbdfd;X2a9701de5;X2b756833a;X30cb60d58;X31b6b140f;X32ef44f44;X353836f41;X37d146733;X396eb7973;X4157e801c;X426544550;X44496bd91;X470b003c2;X4bbdf1dfd;X4ca9a07b6;X500f768d7;X5075233c7;X523925a7d;X5298e035f;X5599890b0;X587b1d98b;X58dac4017;X5a3f6d17a;X5b50c8758;X64d4f135e;X67ab76f9b;X686fbf448;X6918db166;X696daaa44;X6bccaa078;X6fe20cb7e;X756fb7c83;X7b2d20ad8;X7b43f4714;X7f8ea8b3a;X85ddb005a;X8cd6cdb44;X8f14776cd;X92eb38ae3;X9772c87c3;X97a0ceb88;X97d6bf6c2;X97debf7bd;X993793745;X9ae6eefa5;X9cb668f84;X9d4e09cce;Xa00677465;Xa18224528;Xa24633a3c;Xa367db923;Xa43e23b35;Xa5cac42ef;Xa7f5a7d47;Xab09d43f1;Xadf9da05e;Xae8c57816;Xb1f4fe02e;Xb244291b8;Xb3040917d;Xb879656a4;Xba6f9bb0f;Xbca1f79e4;Xbd0ce1b52;Xbd41f5e14;Xbf2334a3f;Xbf89e779c;Xc118e0e26;Xd29326954;Xd84ff8e16;Xda76927d3;Xe19d1656e;Xe34179240;Xea4a82289;Xeb43546e7;Xed446c45e;Xf1ebd4195;Xf234ed166;Xf500ef3fa,88,Dynamic Facial Expression of Emotion Made Easy,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4500,2012

8,"HepRep is a generic, hierarchical format for description of graphics representables that can be augmented by physics information and relational properties. It was developed for high energy physics event display applications and is especially suited to client/server or component frameworks. The GLAST experiment, an international effort led by NASA for a gamma-ray telescope to launch in 2006, chose HepRep to provide a flexible, extensible and maintainable framework for their event display without tying their users to any one graphics application. To support HepRep in their GUADI infrastructure, GLAST developed a HepRep filler and builder architecture. The architecture hides the details of XML and CORBA in a set of base and helper classes allowing physics experts to focus on what data they want to represent. GLAST has two GAUDI services: HepRepSvc, which registers HepRep fillers in a global registry and allows the HepRep to be exported to XML, and CorbaSvc, which allows the HepRep to be published through a CORBA interface and which allows the client application to feed commands back to GAUDI (such as start next event, or run some GAUDI algorithm). GLAST's HepRep solution gives users a choice of client applications, WIRED (written in Java) or FRED (written in C++ and Ruby), and leaves them free to move to any future HepRep-compliant event display.","Perl, J.;Giannitrapani, R.;Frailis, M.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X33000bfe7, X934fbe8d3]",X33000bfe7;X934fbe8d3,2,The Use of HepRep in GLAST,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0306059,2003

12,"The Fr\'{e}chet distance is a well studied and commonly used measure to capture the similarity of polygonal curves. Unfortunately, it exhibits a high sensitivity to the presence of outliers. Since the presence of outliers is a frequently occurring phenomenon in practice, a robust variant of Fr\'{e}chet distance is required which absorbs outliers. We study such a variant here. In this modified variant, our objective is to minimize the length of subcurves of two polygonal curves that need to be ignored (MinEx problem), or alternately, maximize the length of subcurves that are preserved (MaxIn problem), to achieve a given Fr\'{e}chet distance. An exact solution to one problem would imply an exact solution to the other problem. However, we show that these problems are not solvable by radicals over $\mathbb{Q}$ and that the degree of the polynomial equations involved is unbounded in general. This motivates the search for approximate solutions. We present an algorithm, which approximates, for a given input parameter $\delta$, optimal solutions for the \MinEx\ and \MaxIn\ problems up to an additive approximation error $\delta$ times the length of the input curves. The resulting running time is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O} \left(\frac{n^3}{\delta} \log \left(\frac{n}{\delta} \right)\right)$, where $n$ is the complexity of the input polygonal curves.","De Carufel, Jean-Lou;Gheibi, Amin;Maheshwari, Anil;Sack, Jörg-Rüdiger;Scheffer, Christian",ArXiv e-prints,"[X2fe9b7e50, X542b0aa63, X69c0502f5, X77cad084c, Xb0c7c86fe, Xd37773da3, Xd4e4c0dff, Xdd5dd9126]",X2fe9b7e50;X542b0aa63;X69c0502f5;X77cad084c;Xb0c7c86fe;Xd37773da3;Xd4e4c0dff;Xdd5dd9126,8,Similarity of Polygonal Curves in the Presence of Outliers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1617,2012

Moreover, an optimization stage is added to find a corridor placement with the minimum used space, an approach that is designed to mimic the real-life practices to minimize the wasted spaces in the design.

14,"We suggest a new color distance based on two observations. First, perceptual color differences were designed to be used to compare very similar colors. They do not capture human perception for medium and large color differences well. Thresholding was proposed to solve the problem for large color differences, i.e. two totally different colors are always the same distance apart. We show that thresholding alone cannot improve medium color differences. We suggest to alleviate this problem using basic color terms. Second, when a color distance is used for edge detection, many small distances around the just noticeable difference may account for false edges. We suggest to reduce the effect of small distances.","Pele, Ofir;Werman, Michael",ArXiv e-prints,"[X2e74428ae, X4b2575c71, X4db9c9002, X5141830dd, X57ff12f6d, X9693b031b, X9b8509965, Xc92021e82]",X2e74428ae;X4b2575c71;X4db9c9002;X5141830dd;X57ff12f6d;X9693b031b;X9b8509965;Xc92021e82,8,Improving Perceptual Color Difference using Basic Color Terms,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5556,2012
15,"This paper describes a 2D and 3D simulation engine that quantitatively models the statics, dynamics, and non-linear deformation of heterogeneous soft bodies in a computationally efficient manner. There is a large body of work simulating compliant mechanisms. These normally assume small deformations with homogeneous material properties actuated with external forces. There is also a large body of research on physically-based deformable objects for applications in computer graphics with the purpose of generating realistic appearances at the expense of accuracy. Here we present a simulation framework in which an object may be composed of any number of interspersed materials with varying properties (stiffness, density, etc.) to enable true heterogeneous multi-material simulation. Collisions are handled to prevent self-penetration due to large deformation, which also allows multiple bodies to interact. A volumetric actuation method is implemented to impart motion to the structures which opens the door to the design of novel structures and mechanisms. The simulator was implemented efficiently such that objects with thousands of degrees of freedom can be simulated at suitable framerates for user interaction using a single thread of a typical desktop computer. The code is written in platform agnostic C++ and is fully open source. This research opens the door to the dynamic simulation of freeform 3D multi-material mechanisms and objects in a manner suitable for design automation.","Hiller, Jonathan;Lipson, Hod",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00d79dc8b, X00fa7a190, X01761579b, X08b0fdc59, X09afd0578, X0a34fa101, X18f6d0cc5, X25d4b10e8, X27a0195a2, X3ddfeeee6, X4866dc3ec, X53307e635, X54c193f87, X5c5a113b5, X5f046ab11, X614b885ce, X75cc49955, X7b71742b6, X7ce8fa4bb, X99a4113c1, X9b776d0c1, Xa186ca21a, Xa6997817f, Xb4e450b63, Xb544e4958, Xb8e147433, Xba82c1b9d, Xbc4ca5cff, Xbc7d720a4, Xbe4e39122, Xc0e3a3b48, Xc3d060604, Xce487d19b, Xd4fbfbf99, Xd55f8cb5b, Xe4ce2af35, Xe6b80627f, Xf193b1498, Xf2e886b27, Xf585d7c9f, Xfede9c9d9]",X00d79dc8b;X00fa7a190;X01761579b;X08b0fdc59;X09afd0578;X0a34fa101;X18f6d0cc5;X25d4b10e8;X27a0195a2;X3ddfeeee6;X4866dc3ec;X53307e635;X54c193f87;X5c5a113b5;X5f046ab11;X614b885ce;X75cc49955;X7b71742b6;X7ce8fa4bb;X99a4113c1;X9b776d0c1;Xa186ca21a;Xa6997817f;Xb4e450b63;Xb544e4958;Xb8e147433;Xba82c1b9d;Xbc4ca5cff;Xbc7d720a4;Xbe4e39122;Xc0e3a3b48;Xc3d060604;Xce487d19b;Xd4fbfbf99;Xd55f8cb5b;Xe4ce2af35;Xe6b80627f;Xf193b1498;Xf2e886b27;Xf585d7c9f;Xfede9c9d9,41,Dynamic Simulation of Soft Heterogeneous Objects,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2845,2012
16,"We address the problem of surface inpainting, which aims to fill in holes or missing regions on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. In practical situation, surfaces obtained from range scanners often have holes where the 3D models are incomplete. In order to analyze the 3D shapes effectively, restoring the incomplete shape by filling in the surface holes is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel conformal approach to inpaint surface holes on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. The basic idea is to represent the Riemann surface using its conformal factor and mean curvature. According to Riemann surface theory, a Riemann surface can be uniquely determined by its conformal factor and mean curvature up to a rigid motion. Given a Riemann surface $S$, its mean curvature $H$ and conformal factor $\lambda$ can be computed easily through its conformal parameterization. Conversely, given $\lambda$ and $H$, a Riemann surface can be uniquely reconstructed by solving the Gauss-Codazzi equation on the conformal parameter domain. Hence, the conformal factor and the mean curvature are two geometric quantities fully describing the surface. With this $\lambda$-$H$ representation of the surface, the problem of surface inpainting can be reduced to the problem of image inpainting of $\lambda$ and $H$ on the conformal parameter domain. Once $\lambda$ and $H$ are inpainted, a Riemann surface can be reconstructed which effectively restores the 3D surface with missing holes. Since the inpainting model is based on the geometric quantities $\lambda$ and $H$, the restored surface follows the surface geometric pattern. We test the proposed algorithm on synthetic data as well as real surface data. Experimental results show that our proposed method is an effective surface inpainting algorithm to fill in surface holes on an incomplete 3D models based their surface geometry.","Lui, Lok Ming;Wen, Chengfeng;Gu, Xianfeng",ArXiv e-prints,"[X085b35bf0, X1c305bd9e, X212bcceed, X357e7e2fb, X372ecf137, X4ba82ce7d, X4cd34f121, X68fe31db5, X8bc7c4960, Xb483e3648, Xb4d8ce648, Xb58c8c2a4, Xbe551c34f, Xc198d1774, Xcd96f74b6, Xd6f55113c, Xeaa5b3c42, Xf10b9c505, Xf51b76a0f, Xfef85fe0a]",X085b35bf0;X1c305bd9e;X212bcceed;X357e7e2fb;X372ecf137;X4ba82ce7d;X4cd34f121;X68fe31db5;X8bc7c4960;Xb483e3648;Xb4d8ce648;Xb58c8c2a4;Xbe551c34f;Xc198d1774;Xcd96f74b6;Xd6f55113c;Xeaa5b3c42;Xf10b9c505;Xf51b76a0f;Xfef85fe0a,20,A Conformal Approach for Surface Inpainting,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0981,2012
17,"We propose a fast methodology for encoding graphs with information-theoretically minimum numbers of bits. Specifically, a graph with property pi is called a pi-graph. If pi satisfies certain properties, then an n-node m-edge pi-graph G can be encoded by a binary string X such that (1) G and X can be obtained from each other in O(n log n) time, and (2) X has at most beta(n)+o(beta(n)) bits for any continuous super-additive function beta(n) so that there are at most 2^{beta(n)+o(beta(n))} distinct n-node pi-graphs. The methodology is applicable to general classes of graphs; this paper focuses on planar graphs. Examples of such pi include all conjunctions over the following groups of properties: (1) G is a planar graph or a plane graph; (2) G is directed or undirected; (3) G is triangulated, triconnected, biconnected, merely connected, or not required to be connected; (4) the nodes of G are labeled with labels from {1, ..., ell_1} for ell_1 〈= n; (5) the edges of G are labeled with labels from {1, ..., ell_2} for ell_2 〈= m; and (6) each node (respectively, edge) of G has at most ell_3 = O(1) self-loops (respectively, ell_4 = O(1) multiple edges). Moreover, ell_3 and ell_4 are not required to be O(1) for the cases of pi being a plane triangulation. These examples are novel applications of small cycle separators of planar graphs and are the only nontrivial classes of graphs, other than rooted trees, with known polynomial-time information-theoretically optimal coding schemes.","He, Xin;Kao, Ming-Yang;Lu, Hsueh-I",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0843ddabd, X7dbf7e92c, X931f7ac9c, Xa7a75d8a2, Xdfcf98b02, Xe16dbeb7f, Xf28b6b69e]",X0843ddabd;X7dbf7e92c;X931f7ac9c;Xa7a75d8a2;Xdfcf98b02;Xe16dbeb7f;Xf28b6b69e,7,A Fast General Methodology for Information-Theoretically Optimal Encodings of Graphs,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0101021,2001
18,"Given a computer model of a physical object, it is often quite difficult to visualize and quantify any global effects on the shape representation caused by local uncertainty and local errors in the data. This problem is further amplified when dealing with hierarchical representations containing varying levels of detail and / or shapes undergoing dynamic deformations. In this paper, we compute, quantify and visualize the complementary topological and geometrical features of 3D shape models, namely, the tunnels, pockets and internal voids of the object. We find that this approach sheds a unique light on how a model is affected by local uncertainty, errors or modifications and show how the presence or absence of complementary shape features can be essential to an object's structural form and function.","Bajaj, Chandrajit;Gillette, Andrew;Goswami, Samrat;Kwon, Bong June;Rivera, Jose",ArXiv e-prints,"[X1e31c8bce, X290e9f87b, X317e928d9, X610949b96, X91f714a7b, Xae6024ebf]",X1e31c8bce;X290e9f87b;X317e928d9;X610949b96;X91f714a7b;Xae6024ebf,6,Complementary Space for Enhanced Uncertainty and Dynamics Visualization,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4084,2009

20,"Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (SAMR) is a popular numerical technique to study processes with high spatial and temporal dynamic range. It reduces computational requirements by adapting the lattice on which the underlying differential equations are solved to most efficiently represent the solution. Particularly in astrophysics and cosmology such simulations now can capture spatial scales ten orders of magnitude apart and more. The irregular locations and extensions of the refined regions in the SAMR scheme and the fact that different resolution levels partially overlap, poses a challenge for GPU-based direct volume rendering methods. kD-trees have proven to be advantageous to subdivide the data domain into non-overlapping blocks of equally sized cells, optimal for the texture units of current graphics hardware, but previous GPU-supported raycasting approaches for SAMR data using this data structure required a separate rendering pass for each node, preventing the application of many advanced lighting schemes that require simultaneous access to more than one block of cells. In this paper we present the first single-pass GPU-raycasting algorithm for SAMR data that is based on a kD-tree. The tree is efficiently encoded by a set of 3D-textures, which allows to adaptively sample complete rays entirely on the GPU without any CPU interaction. We discuss two different data storage strategies to access the grid data on the GPU and apply them to several datasets to prove the benefits of the proposed method.","Kaehler, Ralf;Abel, Tom",Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Conference Series,"[52a8c79806, X03fd468ec, X040c0c9f6, X07754bbf8, X139a6b9f7, X204cd7bf6, X336f5c0b8, X3416640bb, X609dc48e2, X6ca4acf52, X93979d67d, X99af0e13b, Xa830d7d56, Xa8cc39d2e, Xafb0b24da, Xb5678a495, Xb5d686898, Xb88103239, Xba7d00fd3, Xc6c873840, Xc77d2d0b3, Xe9a98976a, Xf8f49251e]",52a8c79806;X03fd468ec;X040c0c9f6;X07754bbf8;X139a6b9f7;X204cd7bf6;X336f5c0b8;X3416640bb;X609dc48e2;X6ca4acf52;X93979d67d;X99af0e13b;Xa830d7d56;Xa8cc39d2e;Xafb0b24da;Xb5678a495;Xb5d686898;Xb88103239;Xba7d00fd3;Xc6c873840;Xc77d2d0b3;Xe9a98976a;Xf8f49251e,23,Single-pass GPU-raycasting for structured adaptive mesh refinement data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3333,2013
21,"Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are popular unsupervised artificial neural network used to reduce dimensions and visualize data. Visual interpretation from Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) has been limited due to grid approach of data representation, which makes inter-scenario analysis impossible. The paper proposes a new way to structure SOM. This model reconstructs SOM to show strength between variables as the threads of a cobweb and illuminate inter-scenario analysis. While Radar Graphs are very crude representation of spider web, this model uses more lively and realistic cobweb representation to take into account the difference in strength and length of threads. This model allows for visualization of highly unstructured dataset with large number of dimensions, common in Bigdata sources.","Prakash, Aaditya",ArXiv e-prints,"[X017c6d6bc, X0226382b0, X05b84a849, X114e181d0, X12e972ab9, X1a55b2ad8, X1d7828d60, X225b91ad8, X24bd9179b, X29d8693ec, X2ebf6e11b, X307e45eba, X329278918, X3bc7f4ab7, X49caab440, X518be99cf, X538f21bc7, X59be5ee22, X5a3293b91, X5c08df9e1, X626b2466b, X711020fc7, X71c250276, X74224e03e, X772fe2d58, X7c25e3f0a, X7fae08670, X883a4cdd5, X8b0912aac, X8f59a1c93, X938f35cb3, X94394e0df, X9522fab1c, X95b52edd5, X9692562fb, Xa0db24798, Xb061ec840, Xb1509e45e, Xb43c0e39a, Xb50573f60, Xbffeb9d9b, Xc1a762185, Xc500db453, Xce91956ca, Xcfac03818, Xd1d8545db, Xdb63cec04, Xe3290c603, Xe8d7a69b1, Xe8eef8e50, Xea625c697, Xefc1c32f4, Xf0e7c94d1, Xf8e1f12c0, Xfc3589493, Xfcd0ca730]",X017c6d6bc;X0226382b0;X05b84a849;X114e181d0;X12e972ab9;X1a55b2ad8;X1d7828d60;X225b91ad8;X24bd9179b;X29d8693ec;X2ebf6e11b;X307e45eba;X329278918;X3bc7f4ab7;X49caab440;X518be99cf;X538f21bc7;X59be5ee22;X5a3293b91;X5c08df9e1;X626b2466b;X711020fc7;X71c250276;X74224e03e;X772fe2d58;X7c25e3f0a;X7fae08670;X883a4cdd5;X8b0912aac;X8f59a1c93;X938f35cb3;X94394e0df;X9522fab1c;X95b52edd5;X9692562fb;Xa0db24798;Xb061ec840;Xb1509e45e;Xb43c0e39a;Xb50573f60;Xbffeb9d9b;Xc1a762185;Xc500db453;Xce91956ca;Xcfac03818;Xd1d8545db;Xdb63cec04;Xe3290c603;Xe8d7a69b1;Xe8eef8e50;Xea625c697;Xefc1c32f4;Xf0e7c94d1;Xf8e1f12c0;Xfc3589493;Xfcd0ca730,56,Reconstructing Self Organizing Maps as Spider Graphs for better visual interpretation of large unstructured datasets,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0289,2012
22,"Designing 3D objects from scratch is difficult, especially when the user intent is fuzzy without a clear target form. In the spirit of modeling-by-example, we facilitate design by providing reference and inspiration from existing model contexts. We rethink model design as navigating through different possible combinations of part assemblies based on a large collection of pre-segmented 3D models. We propose an interactive sketch-to-design system, where the user sketches prominent features of parts to combine. The sketched strokes are analyzed individually and in context with the other parts to generate relevant shape suggestions via a design gallery interface. As the session progresses and more parts get selected, contextual cues becomes increasingly dominant and the system quickly converges to a final design. As a key enabler, we use pre-learned part-based contextual information to allow the user to quickly explore different combinations of parts. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for efficiently designing new variations from existing shapes.","Xie, Xiaohua;Xu, Kai;Mitra, Niloy J.;Cohen-Or, Daniel;Chen, Baoquan",ArXiv e-prints,"[X029517800, X09ff76133, X0bbbdfb3c, X148e63d33, X1de40568c, X23dd43255, X29df2a9e5, X30945bfc3, X369036e3f, X3c1ad2d3a, X455846a7b, X47b2f9da5, X4b22b0d9c, X4b49e11e9, X4ba239edb, X513d5e83b, X5d1bac157, X653b5550c, X65c200ed8, X82fa6b220, X835921e36, X8a7c56b55, X8b1aa0b95, X8c54c754d, X93e5546b6, X96dcdab49, Xa832f538d, Xa855a5e14, Xa8eb32b4a, Xb009b6d6b, Xe462ee0b0, Xe4ebf68b3, Xed27642bd, Xf3d4a9195, Xf8036cd06, Xfffe49a03]",X029517800;X09ff76133;X0bbbdfb3c;X148e63d33;X1de40568c;X23dd43255;X29df2a9e5;X30945bfc3;X369036e3f;X3c1ad2d3a;X455846a7b;X47b2f9da5;X4b22b0d9c;X4b49e11e9;X4ba239edb;X513d5e83b;X5d1bac157;X653b5550c;X65c200ed8;X82fa6b220;X835921e36;X8a7c56b55;X8b1aa0b95;X8c54c754d;X93e5546b6;X96dcdab49;Xa832f538d;Xa855a5e14;Xa8eb32b4a;Xb009b6d6b;Xe462ee0b0;Xe4ebf68b3;Xed27642bd;Xf3d4a9195;Xf8036cd06;Xfffe49a03,36,Sketch-to-Design: Context-based Part Assembly,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.4490,2012

In this paper, we present a real study case of building the discrete surface model (DSM) at Haut-Barr Castle in France based on the elevation data of terrain points extracted from GE using the COM API. We first locate the position of Haut-Barr Castle and determine the region of the study area, then extract elevation data of terrain at Haut-Barr, and thirdly create a planar triangular mesh that covers the study area and finally generate the desired DSM by calculating the elevation of vertices in the planar mesh via interpolating with Universal Kriging (UK) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The generated DSM can reflect the features of the ground surface at Haut-Barr well, and can be used for constructingthe Sealed Engineering Geological Model (SEGM) in further step.","Mei, Gang;Tipper, John C.;Xu, Nengxiong",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0feae6e6f, X14f947b98, X1a0093e7b, X1ca07a941, X2e3bdf8e9, X2efb86eb6, X326dccf7d, X4256f9dfe, X460caa45b, X5107a9a92, X5428a25b0, X60fa5f7c8, X634b5c9e8, X678cd6e4c, X67eb40cde, X69f91b9a7, X72206ea34, X75353c021, X7e03c067e, X86e8672f4, X8f002dba0, X9639d59f9, X9768bff1c, X99db2f31c, Xa8fd41c63, Xad8fb1ec6, Xaecbf494b, Xb3c90df2b, Xb505be2d3, Xbe6a4f994, Xbeca3f405, Xc6b0c586e, Xc6bbea1ca, Xcb15d40e9, Xcba0a7be6, Xd3b7c76b7, Xdbaa68486, Xe132f3167, Xe736793b0, Xe8aabec87, Xeb6dfb44f, Xeb998a3de, Xed2d93d59]",X0feae6e6f;X14f947b98;X1a0093e7b;X1ca07a941;X2e3bdf8e9;X2efb86eb6;X326dccf7d;X4256f9dfe;X460caa45b;X5107a9a92;X5428a25b0;X60fa5f7c8;X634b5c9e8;X678cd6e4c;X67eb40cde;X69f91b9a7;X72206ea34;X75353c021;X7e03c067e;X86e8672f4;X8f002dba0;X9639d59f9;X9768bff1c;X99db2f31c;Xa8fd41c63;Xad8fb1ec6;Xaecbf494b;Xb3c90df2b;Xb505be2d3;Xbe6a4f994;Xbeca3f405;Xc6b0c586e;Xc6bbea1ca;Xcb15d40e9;Xcba0a7be6;Xd3b7c76b7;Xdbaa68486;Xe132f3167;Xe736793b0;Xe8aabec87;Xeb6dfb44f;Xeb998a3de;Xed2d93d59,43,Discrete Surface Modeling Based on Google Earth: A Case Study,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6048,2012

One important parameter is the sea surface temperature (SST) of the Atlantic Ocean, where many of these systems strengthen and gain much of their structure.

For the wanner SST simulations, the SSTs over the model domain were increased by 1°C. This change increased the total surface heat fluxes in all of the storms, and the resulting simulated storms were all more intense.

28,"IFS fractals — the attractors of Iterated Function Systems — have motivated plenty of research to date, partly due to their simplicity and applicability in various fields, such as the modeling of plants in computer graphics, and the design of fractal antennas. The statement and resolution of the Fractal-Line Intersection Problem is imperative for a more efficient treatment of certain applications. This paper intends to take further steps towards this resolution, building on the literature. For the broad class of hyperdense fractals, a verifiable condition guaranteeing intersection with any line passing through the convex hull of a planar IFS fractal is shown, in general &R;<SUP>d</SUP> for hyperplanes. The condition also implies a constructive algorithm for finding the points of intersection. Under certain conditions, an infinite number of approximate intersections are guaranteed, if there is at least one. Quantification of the intersection is done via an explicit formula for the invariant measure of IFS.","Vass, József",Fractals,"[X056620134, X1c15e36fb, X2921de09d, X3d0f20f64, X565c4f0bf, X6150c7450, X8727c7c7a, Xc7c5c6d5b, Xcb8b4991f, Xd78cd0a86, Xf1b08686a, Xfc514fedd]",X056620134;X1c15e36fb;X2921de09d;X3d0f20f64;X565c4f0bf;X6150c7450;X8727c7c7a;Xc7c5c6d5b;Xcb8b4991f;Xd78cd0a86;Xf1b08686a;Xfc514fedd,12,On Intersecting Ifs Fractals with Lines,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1379,2014

30,"In the coming era of exascale supercomputing, in-situ visualization will be a crucial approach for reducing the output data size. A problem of in-situ visualization is that it loses interactivity if a steering method is not adopted. In this paper, we propose a new method for the interactive analysis of in-situ visualization images produced by a batch simulation job. A key idea is to apply numerous (thousands to millions) in-situ visualizations simultaneously. The viewer then analyzes the image database interactively during postprocessing. If each movie can be compressed to 100 MB, one million movies will only require 100 TB, which is smaller than the size of the raw numerical data in exascale supercomputing. We performed a feasibility study using the proposed method. Multiple movie files were produced by a simulation and they were analyzed using a specially designed movie player. The user could change the viewing angle, the visualization method, and the parameters interactively by retrieving an appropriate sequence of images from the movie dataset.","Kageyama, Akira;Yamada, Tomoki",Computer Physics Communications,"[X051177f2d, X08366afd6, X1089a5d71, X138f6521a, X2d4efc6e4, X2d9931d3c, X39acf7a59, X3d3d0c4f1, X48df54ff2, X57f236ee2, X5f31d7dec, X798d11852, X8436ed371, X9bdcea7d1, Xa3bca68c2, Xa9842c66c, Xc00066c53, Xc2b6dc59f, Xca82f0e37, Xcab5ab905, Xcf11b9385, Xd63f563bf, Xda06e9af5, Xf15be96b2, Xf27f6ca8c, Xf52006d26, Xf7124cfa5]",X051177f2d;X08366afd6;X1089a5d71;X138f6521a;X2d4efc6e4;X2d9931d3c;X39acf7a59;X3d3d0c4f1;X48df54ff2;X57f236ee2;X5f31d7dec;X798d11852;X8436ed371;X9bdcea7d1;Xa3bca68c2;Xa9842c66c;Xc00066c53;Xc2b6dc59f;Xca82f0e37;Xcab5ab905;Xcf11b9385;Xd63f563bf;Xda06e9af5;Xf15be96b2;Xf27f6ca8c;Xf52006d26;Xf7124cfa5,27,An approach to exascale visualization: Interactive viewing of in-situ visualization,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4546,2014

The interactions between the nodes are implemented using MPI. The parallel remote rendering uses Chromium. This paper is mainly the report of our implementation experiences. We present in detail the proposed model and key aspects of its implementation. Also, we present performance measurements, we benchmark and quantitatively demonstrate the dependence of the visualization speed on the data size and the network bandwidth, and we identify the singularities and draw conclusions on Chromium's sort-first rendering architecture.

In this paper, we introduce a practical solution for building 3D geological models for rock masses based on the data acquired by use with GE. A real study case at Haut-Barr, France is presented to demonstrate our solution. We first locate the position of Haut-Barr in GE, and then determine the shape and scale of the rock masses in the study area, and thirdly acquire the layout of layers of rock masses in the Google Street View, and finally create the approximate 3D geological models by extruding and intersecting.

38,"When representing a solid object there are alternatives to the use of traditional explicit (surface meshes) or implicit (zero crossing of implicit functions) methods. Skeletal representations encode shape information in a mixed fashion: they are composed of a set of explicit primitives, yet they are able to efficiently encode the shape's volume as well as its topology. I will discuss, in two dimensions, how symmetry can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data (from a 2D solid to a 1D curve), and how this relates to the classical definition of skeletons by Medial Axis Transform. While the medial axis of a 2D shape is composed of a set of curves, in 3D it results in a set of sheets connected in a complex fashion. Because of this complexity, medial skeletons are difficult to use in practical applications. Curve skeletons address this problem by strictly requiring their geometry to be one dimensional, resulting in an intuitive yet powerful shape representation. In this report I will define both medial and curve skeletons and discuss their mutual relationship. I will also present several algorithms for their computation and a variety of scenarios where skeletons are employed, with a special focus on geometry processing and shape analysis.","Tagliasacchi, Andrea",ArXiv e-prints,"[X09a461537, X0a21bbabc, X0b467d7d7, X13edf8fba, X2a77fa211, X5782d73da, X6bc7e7306, X6c4a1fe10, X7fd7986e9, X82c444250, X83af0fb89, X9e5aac98f, Xabfaaa16b, Xc52e3d547, Xc59ef2aad, Xd821b3e0b, Xd857e7376, Xd93df9a02, Xe2d6aed4d, Xf158ab3ae, Xfa0c33678]",X09a461537;X0a21bbabc;X0b467d7d7;X13edf8fba;X2a77fa211;X5782d73da;X6bc7e7306;X6c4a1fe10;X7fd7986e9;X82c444250;X83af0fb89;X9e5aac98f;Xabfaaa16b;Xc52e3d547;Xc59ef2aad;Xd821b3e0b;Xd857e7376;Xd93df9a02;Xe2d6aed4d;Xf158ab3ae;Xfa0c33678,21,Skeletal Representations and Applications,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6809,2013

We estimate the blur kernel first from only the strongest edges in the image, then gradually refine this estimate by allowing for weaker and weaker edges.

41,"Many image watermarking schemes have been proposed in recent years, but they usually involve embedding a watermark to the entire image without considering only a particular object in the image, which the image owner may be interested in. This paper proposes a watermarking scheme that can embed a watermark to an arbitrarily shaped object in an image. Before embedding, the image owner specifies an object of arbitrary shape that is of a concern to him. Then the object is transformed into the wavelet domain using in place lifting shape adaptive DWT(SADWT) and a watermark is embedded by modifying the wavelet coefficients. In order to make the watermark robust and transparent, the watermark is embedded in the average of wavelet blocks using the visual model based on the human visual system. Wavelet coefficients n least significant bits (LSBs) are adjusted in concert with the average. Simulation results shows that the proposed watermarking scheme is perceptually invisible and robust against many attacks such as lossy compression (e.g.JPEG, JPEG2000), scaling, adding noise, filtering, etc.","Essaouabi, A.;Ibnelhaj, E.;Fegragui, F.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X6bb323ac7, Xe4c196aa2, Xe8d228f40, Xf37f3b68b]",X6bb323ac7;Xe4c196aa2;Xe8d228f40;Xf37f3b68b,4,Digital Image Watermarking for Arbitrarily Shaped Objects Based On SA-DWT,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0902,2009
42,"Volume Rendering applications require sophisticated user interaction for the definition and refinement of transfer functions. Traditional 2D desktop user interface elements have been developed to solve this task, but such concepts do not map well to the interaction devices available in Virtual Reality environments. In this paper, we propose an intuitive user interface for Volume Rendering specifically designed for Virtual Reality environments. The proposed interface allows transfer function design and refinement based on intuitive two-handed operation of Wand-like controllers. Additional interaction modes such as navigation and clip plane manipulation are supported as well. The system is implemented using the Sony PlayStation Move controller system. This choice is based on controller device capabilities as well as application and environment constraints. Initial results document the potential of our approach.","Klein, Jonathan;Reuling, Dennis;Grimm, Jan;Pfau, Andreas;Lefloch, Damien;Lambers, Martin;Kolb, Andreas",ArXiv e-prints,"[X083ee9e8d, X1824301f5, X19486947a, X1986bcf9e, X1d829e778, X1d90e9973, X26b2f773d, X3324a43e6, X3a8a40d06, X49eaa44d6, X51dd889ea, X56894f733, X59fcccdc3, X5b0887791, X612fca347, X66a8b8a67, X6f3518853, X8151ac5b4, X8c3cb8497, X8ec91c60b, X96aaf9405, X9f030c9b6, Xa0f5fd056, Xa4355d918, Xb650dccdf, Xb858273c6, Xce04e404f, Xce960a713, Xd92209593, Xdd69b2995, Xdda8164af, Xe5617fe83, Xed5863753, Xf6690dca8]",X083ee9e8d;X1824301f5;X19486947a;X1986bcf9e;X1d829e778;X1d90e9973;X26b2f773d;X3324a43e6;X3a8a40d06;X49eaa44d6;X51dd889ea;X56894f733;X59fcccdc3;X5b0887791;X612fca347;X66a8b8a67;X6f3518853;X8151ac5b4;X8c3cb8497;X8ec91c60b;X96aaf9405;X9f030c9b6;Xa0f5fd056;Xa4355d918;Xb650dccdf;Xb858273c6;Xce04e404f;Xce960a713;Xd92209593;Xdd69b2995;Xdda8164af;Xe5617fe83;Xed5863753;Xf6690dca8,34,User Interface for Volume Rendering in Virtual Reality Environments,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2024,2013
43,"We formalize the notion of sampling a function using k-d darts. A k-d dart is a set of independent, mutually orthogonal, k-dimensional subspaces called k-d flats. Each dart has d choose k flats, aligned with the coordinate axes for efficiency. We show that k-d darts are useful for exploring a function's properties, such as estimating its integral, or finding an exemplar above a threshold. We describe a recipe for converting an algorithm from point sampling to k-d dart sampling, assuming the function can be evaluated along a k-d flat. We demonstrate that k-d darts are more efficient than point-wise samples in high dimensions, depending on the characteristics of the sampling domain: e.g. the subregion of interest has small volume and evaluating the function along a flat is not too expensive. We present three concrete applications using line darts (1-d darts): relaxed maximal Poisson-disk sampling, high-quality rasterization of depth-of-field blur, and estimation of the probability of failure from a response surface for uncertainty quantification. In these applications, line darts achieve the same fidelity output as point darts in less time. We also demonstrate the accuracy of higher dimensional darts for a volume estimation problem. For Poisson-disk sampling, we use significantly less memory, enabling the generation of larger point clouds in higher dimensions.","Ebeida, Mohamed S.;Patney, Anjul;Mitchell, Scott A.;Dalbey, Keith R.;Davidson, Andrew A.;Owens, John D.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X008abde51, X217a8122a, X249f7683e, X31cb9d217, X414cc6a88, X4bee929c2, X547cb26b0, X593708996, X629dae968, X78402390c, X7ec06fb0f, Xcdaa8c67f, Xe10ef5a5c, Xe676c2b33]",X008abde51;X217a8122a;X249f7683e;X31cb9d217;X414cc6a88;X4bee929c2;X547cb26b0;X593708996;X629dae968;X78402390c;X7ec06fb0f;Xcdaa8c67f;Xe10ef5a5c;Xe676c2b33,14,k-d Darts: Sampling by k-Dimensional Flat Searches,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3917,2013
44,"The novel STEVE (i.e., Space-Time-Enclosing Volume Extraction) algorithm is described here for the very first time. It generates iso-valued hypersurfaces that may be implicitly contained in four-dimensional (4D) data sets, such as temporal sequences of three-dimensional images from time-varying computed tomography. Any final hypersurface that will be generated by STEVE is guaranteed to be free from accidental rifts, i.e., it always fully encloses a region in the 4D space under consideration. Furthermore, the information of the interior/exterior of the enclosed regions is propagated to each one of the tetrahedrons, which are embedded into 4D and which in their union represent the final, iso-valued hypersurface(s). We argue that STEVE - while using a minimum of data redundancy in representing the final results - is faster than other techniques that generate simplex-based manifolds of codimension 1.","Schlei, B.

In addition to providing simple graphical objects such as windows, geometric shapes, and bitmaps, EzWindows provides facilities for introducing event-based programming using the mouse and timers.

47,"Massive data sets have radically changed our understanding of how to design efficient algorithms; the streaming paradigm, whether it in terms of number of passes of an external memory algorithm, or the single pass and limited memory of a stream algorithm, appears to be the dominant method for coping with large data. A very different kind of massive computation has had the same effect at the level of the CPU. The most prominent example is that of the computations performed by a graphics card. The operations themselves are very simple, and require very little memory, but require the ability to perform many computations extremely fast and in parallel to whatever degree possible. What has resulted is a stream processor that is highly optimized for stream computations. An intriguing side effect of this is the growing use of a graphics card as a general purpose stream processing engine. In an ever-increasing array of applications, researchers are discovering that performing a computation on a graphics card is far faster than performing it on a CPU, and so are using a GPU as a stream co-processor.","Venkatasubramanian, Suresh",ArXiv e-prints,"[X123562c86, X2e619b294, X3292f2362, X42d92f90e, X4e6d2814c, X7f8ea8b3a, X90c6725b3, X99af0e13b, Xa088cc370, Xaee6caaf0, Xb65cc8862, Xf3e61521c]",X123562c86;X2e619b294;X3292f2362;X42d92f90e;X4e6d2814c;X7f8ea8b3a;X90c6725b3;X99af0e13b;Xa088cc370;Xaee6caaf0;Xb65cc8862;Xf3e61521c,12,The Graphics Card as a Streaming Computer,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0310002,2003

We illustrate the use of stereo pairs with one conceptual and two Astrophysical science examples: an integral field spectroscopy study of a supernova remnant, and numerical simulations of a relativistic AGN jet. We also use these examples to make the case that stereo pairs are not merely an ostentatious way to present data, but an enhancement in the communication of scientific results in publications because they provide the reader with a realistic view of multi-dimensional data, be it of observational or theoretical nature.

51,"Glyph-based visualization is an effective tool for depicting multivariate information. Since sorting is one of the most common analytical tasks performed on individual attributes of a multi-dimensional data set, this motivates the hypothesis that introducing glyph sorting would significantly enhance the usability of glyph-based visualization. In this paper, we present a glyph-based conceptual framework as part of a visualization process for interactive sorting of multivariate data. We examine several technical aspects of glyph sorting and provide design principles for developing effective, visually sortable glyphs. Glyphs that are visually sortable provide two key benefits: 1) performing comparative analysis of multiple attributes between glyphs and 2) to support multi-dimensional visual search. We describe a system that incorporates focus and context glyphs to control sorting in a visually intuitive manner and for viewing sorted results in an Interactive, Multi-dimensional Glyph (IMG) plot that enables users to perform high-dimensional sorting, analyse and examine data trends in detail. To demonstrate the usability of glyph sorting, we present a case study in rugby event analysis for comparing and analysing trends within matches. This work is undertaken in conjunction with a national rugby team. From using glyph sorting, analysts have reported the discovery of new insight beyond traditional match analysis.","Chung, David H.

52,"This paper presents a technique for reducing speckle in Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) imagery using Nonlocal Means and a statistical test based on stochastic divergences. The main objective is to select homogeneous pixels in the filtering area through statistical tests between distributions. This proposal uses the complex Wishart model to describe PolSAR data, but the technique can be extended to other models. The weights of the location-variant linear filter are function of the p-values of tests which verify the hypothesis that two samples come from the same distribution and, therefore, can be used to compute a local mean. The test stems from the family of (h-phi) divergences which originated in Information Theory. This novel technique was compared with the Boxcar, Refined Lee and IDAN filters. Image quality assessment methods on simulated and real data are employed to validate the performance of this approach. We show that the proposed filter also enhances the polarimetric entropy and preserves the scattering information of the targets.","Torres, Leonardo;Sant'Anna, Sidnei J.

53,"Polyhedral meshes (PM) - meshes having planar faces - have enjoyed a rise in popularity in recent years due to their importance in architectural and industrial design. However, they are also notoriously difficult to generate and manipulate. Previous methods start with a smooth surface and then apply elaborate meshing schemes to create polyhedral meshes approximating the surface. In this paper, we describe a reverse approach: given the topology of a mesh, we explore the space of possible planar meshes with that topology. Our approach is based on a complete characterization of the maximal linear spaces of polyhedral meshes contained in the curved manifold of polyhedral meshes with a given topology. We show that these linear spaces can be described as nullspaces of differential operators, much like harmonic functions are nullspaces of the Laplacian operator. An analysis of this operator provides tools for global and local design of a polyhedral mesh, which fully expose the geometric possibilities and limitations of the given topology.","Poranne, Roi;Chen, Renjie;Gotsman, Craig",ArXiv e-prints,"[X1b174fff3, X20ac68a6e, X39acf7a59, X446269783, X48df8689f, X4d298cc7a, X4d96a98a2, X5e619a5c8, X74fc82910, X8a49512e8, X971143ce6, Xbd5b1aa7a, Xd193aa263, Xf4aebda16]",X1b174fff3;X20ac68a6e;X39acf7a59;X446269783;X48df8689f;X4d298cc7a;X4d96a98a2;X5e619a5c8;X74fc82910;X8a49512e8;X971143ce6;Xbd5b1aa7a;Xd193aa263;Xf4aebda16,14,On Linear Spaces of Polyhedral Meshes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4110,2013

These kinds of brand-new data were defined by using the existing type-2 fuzzy set theory(T2FST) and type-2 fuzzy number(T2FN) concept since we dealt with the problem of defining complex uncertainty data. Along with this restructuring, we included the fuzzification(alpha-cut operation), type-reduction and defuzzification processes against PNT2FDPs.

69,"In many graphics applications, the computation of exact geodesic distance is very important. However, the high computational cost of the existing geodesic algorithms means that they are not practical for large-scale models or time-critical applications. To tackle this challenge, we propose the parallel Chen-Han (or PCH) algorithm, which extends the classic Chen-Han (CH) discrete geodesic algorithm to the parallel setting. The original CH algorithm and its variant both lack a parallel solution because the windows (a key data structure that carries the shortest distance in the wavefront propagation) are maintained in a strict order or a tightly coupled manner, which means that only one window is processed at a time. We propose dividing the CH's sequential algorithm into four phases, window selection, window propagation, data organization, and events processing so that there is no data dependence or conflicts in each phase and the operations within each phase can be carried out in parallel. The proposed PCH algorithm is able to propagate a large number of windows simultaneously and independently. We also adopt a simple yet effective strategy to control the total number of windows. We implement the PCH algorithm on modern GPUs (such as Nvidia GTX 580) and analyze the performance in detail. The performance improvement (compared to the sequential algorithms) is highly consistent with GPU double-precision performance (GFLOPS). Extensive experiments on real-world models demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in execution time compared to the state-of-the-art.","Ying, Xiang;Xin, Shi-Qing;He, Ying",ArXiv e-prints,"[X101e4bbfa, X2360f481e, X2abcab386, X317de37cc, X385cac60a, X3aa85f71e, X43b218746, X4ab98ea22, X5164709c2, X69f159ed5, X8e7303edd, X9a5c9cc06, Xa0c8646b6, Xa4157b94b, Xb6fee53e5, Xc6be86874, Xc9d6adbb4, Xd67105b29, Xddce45625, Xe415a754f, Xeb4675ada, Xf08ba40f3, Xfa9ba4fc3]",X101e4bbfa;X2360f481e;X2abcab386;X317de37cc;X385cac60a;X3aa85f71e;X43b218746;X4ab98ea22;X5164709c2;X69f159ed5;X8e7303edd;X9a5c9cc06;Xa0c8646b6;Xa4157b94b;Xb6fee53e5;Xc6be86874;Xc9d6adbb4;Xd67105b29;Xddce45625;Xe415a754f;Xeb4675ada;Xf08ba40f3;Xfa9ba4fc3,23,Parallel Chen-Han (PCH) Algorithm for Discrete Geodesics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1293,2013

Here we demonstrate a simple, robust set of algorithms for performing circle blends for a range of cases. An arbitrary level of G-continuity can be achieved by simple alterations to the underlying parameterisation. Our method exploits the computational framework provided by conformal geometric algebra. This employs a five-dimensional representation of points in space, in contrast to the four-dimensional representation typically used in projective geometry. The advantage of the conformal scheme is that straight lines and circles are treated in a single, unified framework.

73,"This paper presents a method to obtain geometric registrations between high-genus ($g\geq 1$) surfaces. Surface registration between simple surfaces, such as simply-connected open surfaces, has been well studied. However, very few works have been carried out for the registration of high-genus surfaces. The high-genus topology of the surface poses great challenge for surface registration. A possible approach is to partition surfaces into simply-connected patches and registration is done patch by patch. Consistent cuts are required, which are usually difficult to obtain and prone to error. In this work, we propose an effective way to obtain geometric registration between high-genus surfaces without introducing consistent cuts. The key idea is to conformally parameterize the surface into its universal covering space, which is either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic disk embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Registration can then be done on the universal covering space by minimizing a shape mismatching energy measuring the geometric dissimilarity between the two surfaces. Our proposed algorithm effectively computes a smooth registration between high-genus surfaces that matches geometric information as much as possible. The algorithm can also be applied to find a smooth and bijective registration minimizing any general energy functionals. Numerical experiments on high-genus surface data show that our proposed method is effective for registering high-genus surfaces with geometric matching. We also applied the method to register anatomical structures for medical imaging, which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.","Wen, Chengfeng;Lui, Lok Ming",ArXiv e-prints,"[X189448468, X2bb596408, X52c11a5ba, X83795c9ca, Xa28ff00bd, Xbc956e607, Xc2195d0d3, Xed3077784, Xf9bdaa7af]",X189448468;X2bb596408;X52c11a5ba;X83795c9ca;Xa28ff00bd;Xbc956e607;Xc2195d0d3;Xed3077784;Xf9bdaa7af,9,Geometric Registration of High-genus Surfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2283,2013

Parallel coordinate plot (PCP), as a powerful visualization tool, can efficiently display high-dimensional geometry and accurately analyze multivariate data.

Our pipeline has two major advantages: (1) combine and display extracted high-dimensional features in parameter space; and (2) select appropriate high-dimensional parameters, with the help of dimensional reduction methods, to obtain sophisticated data classification as transfer function for volume rendering.

Here, we develop general analysis tools to show that the limiting surfaces under midpoint subdivision of any degree 〉= 2 are C1-continuous at their extraordinary points.","Prautzsch, Hartmut;Chen, Qi",ArXiv e-prints,"[X3244f6f1c, X3b802aaf5, X4095ceed5, X5190064b8, X69e45beed, X6a6363a45, X7950021ff, X7dfe50cc1, X814837d52, X98f81b11b, X99693601d, Xa82af076c, Xb60c6e713, Xcdab55a88, Xe63f8faa0, Xed0623ac1, Xf3d4a9195, Xf6e8bbec8]",X3244f6f1c;X3b802aaf5;X4095ceed5;X5190064b8;X69e45beed;X6a6363a45;X7950021ff;X7dfe50cc1;X814837d52;X98f81b11b;X99693601d;Xa82af076c;Xb60c6e713;Xcdab55a88;Xe63f8faa0;Xed0623ac1;Xf3d4a9195;Xf6e8bbec8,18,Analyzing Midpoint Subdivision,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5157,2009
76,"Optimization-based filtering smoothes an image by minimizing a fidelity function and simultaneously preserves edges by exploiting a sparse norm penalty over gradients. It has obtained promising performance in practical problems, such as detail manipulation, HDR compression and deblurring, and thus has received increasing attentions in fields of graphics, computer vision and image processing. This paper derives a new type of image filter called sparse norm filter (SNF) from optimization-based filtering. SNF has a very simple form, introduces a general class of filtering techniques, and explains several classic filters as special implementations of SNF, e.g. the averaging filter and the median filter. It has advantages of being halo free, easy to implement, and low time and memory costs (comparable to those of the bilateral filter). Thus, it is more generic than a smoothing operator and can better adapt to different tasks. We validate the proposed SNF by a wide variety of applications including edge-preserving smoothing, outlier tolerant filtering, detail manipulation, HDR compression, non-blind deconvolution, image segmentation, and colorization.","Ye, Chengxi;Tao, Dacheng;Song, Mingli;Jacobs, David W.;Wu, Min",ArXiv e-prints,"[5542d40756, X06d4e3293, X0b467d7d7, X0ca931c47, X101e4bbfa, X183deb70d, X1845f5b9d, X22471e7f2, X22fd503c1, X24757d814, X25dc7a735, X2a4a86f62, X313e2ad7f, X33db9cbf2, X35ddb3dac, X3bedc8c50, X4bb29fbd2, X4dbe500e3, X54e2c97bb, X5ab841c64, X5c10b99a6, X5c1ed67ea, X5cad13f12, X5d0fd54b4, X632e460e9, X63a15cd37, X65697f95a, X6734e3e83, X687d95836, X6b6f92de1, X748efdfe7, X76abb74d9, X7bd0dccd6, X7c6c8629e, X813f4d8f7, X8424ed486, X87867cebd, X8923025c9, X8b89da9a3, X8fbc24bc6, X90c5876a7, X92110b410, X97b973913, X9868f667f, Xa153399ab, Xa8f8ba34c, Xb384b622d, Xbf6197462, Xc6fec0dfb, Xc7ffeb404, Xcd56f4d69, Xd660a50e1, Xdfb2dfe61, Xe1b17611e, Xe25f1af81, Xe2bc4c5b6, Xe7bfac86e, Xe89362b53, Xe917ac999, Xeb331ab33, Xed564d49a, Xf7ca0d8f0]",5542d40756;X06d4e3293;X0b467d7d7;X0ca931c47;X101e4bbfa;X183deb70d;X1845f5b9d;X22471e7f2;X22fd503c1;X24757d814;X25dc7a735;X2a4a86f62;X313e2ad7f;X33db9cbf2;X35ddb3dac;X3bedc8c50;X4bb29fbd2;X4dbe500e3;X54e2c97bb;X5ab841c64;X5c10b99a6;X5c1ed67ea;X5cad13f12;X5d0fd54b4;X632e460e9;X63a15cd37;X65697f95a;X6734e3e83;X687d95836;X6b6f92de1;X748efdfe7;X76abb74d9;X7bd0dccd6;X7c6c8629e;X813f4d8f7;X8424ed486;X87867cebd;X8923025c9;X8b89da9a3;X8fbc24bc6;X90c5876a7;X92110b410;X97b973913;X9868f667f;Xa153399ab;Xa8f8ba34c;Xb384b622d;Xbf6197462;Xc6fec0dfb;Xc7ffeb404;Xcd56f4d69;Xd660a50e1;Xdfb2dfe61;Xe1b17611e;Xe25f1af81;Xe2bc4c5b6;Xe7bfac86e;Xe89362b53;Xe917ac999;Xeb331ab33;Xed564d49a;Xf7ca0d8f0,62,Sparse Norm Filtering,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3971,2013
77,"Already Hermann Grassmann's father Justus (1829, 1830) published two works on the geometrical description of crystals, influenced by the earlier works of C.S. Weiss (1780-1856) on three main crystal forces governing crystal formation. In his 1840 essay on the derivation of crystal shapes from the general law of crystal formation Hermann established the notion of a three-dimensional vectorial system of forces with rational coefficients, that represent the interior crystal structure, regulate its formation, its shape and physical behavior. In the Ausdehnungslehre 1844 (Paragraph 171) he finally writes: I shall conclude this presentation by one of the most beautiful applications which can be made of the science treated, i.e. the application to crystal figures (Scholz, 1996). The geometry of crystals thus certainly influenced the Ausdehnungslehre. In this paper we see how Grassmann's work influenced Clifford's creation of geometric algebras, which in turn leads to a new geometric description of crystal symmetry suitable for modern computer algebra graphics.","Hitzer, Eckhard",ArXiv e-prints,"[X063fe6a65, X1b36db60b, X74e0f02f7, X87d226d57, Xbec4fdac0, Xc69c01763, Xd69df1add, Xd7ec3b27a, Xeb22f4950, Xf50b0aa72]",X063fe6a65;X1b36db60b;X74e0f02f7;X87d226d57;Xbec4fdac0;Xc69c01763;Xd69df1add;Xd7ec3b27a;Xeb22f4950;Xf50b0aa72,10,New Views of Crystal Symmetry,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1599,2013

85,"We present an approach to robustly track the geometry of an object that deforms over time from a set of input point clouds captured from a single viewpoint. The deformations we consider are caused by applying forces to known locations on the object's surface. Our method combines the use of prior information on the geometry of the object modeled by a smooth template and the use of a linear finite element method to predict the deformation. This allows the accurate reconstruction of both the observed and the unobserved sides of the object. We present tracking results for noisy low-quality point clouds acquired by either a stereo camera or a depth camera, and simulations with point clouds corrupted by different error terms. We show that our method is also applicable to large non-linear deformations.","Wuhrer, Stefanie;Lang, Jochen;Tekieh, Motahareh;Shu, Chang",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00fa7a190, X0b559beb5, X0ecf76a5a, X1776b52cf, X21832dbb7, X267c4e061, X272842d09, X2bd414e0b, X2db070b4a, X2e1c1bd04, X2e806d77c, X36fb97a09, X3b5fcaa6c, X402b5e339, X4210839df, X4401b1f98, X4470afbfc, X458220bf7, X4a5e61185, X4d19fba47, X576fc2ce8, X60009024c, X604bce283, X6310b8fdd, X695288134, X6a893f35f, X6ab8d94e2, X71c8e73cc, X741c3e182, X794b98f6e, X84d313e5c, X8b0581d67, X8b1aa0b95, X91f4e6ae7, X9898ffe69, X9bacaaf39, X9c4d175ae, Xa013b3478, Xa181cdfbb, Xa6c090abb, Xa7856da67, Xac0ee97e4, Xaed5f7894, Xc7ee2da1f, Xd1f30b564, Xe09905de8, Xe676c2b33, Xefede5adb, Xf25f2a8ad, Xf41c182e5, Xf7eec358b, Xfa53f7843, Xfb1e0f0f8]",X00fa7a190;X0b559beb5;X0ecf76a5a;X1776b52cf;X21832dbb7;X267c4e061;X272842d09;X2bd414e0b;X2db070b4a;X2e1c1bd04;X2e806d77c;X36fb97a09;X3b5fcaa6c;X402b5e339;X4210839df;X4401b1f98;X4470afbfc;X458220bf7;X4a5e61185;X4d19fba47;X576fc2ce8;X60009024c;X604bce283;X6310b8fdd;X695288134;X6a893f35f;X6ab8d94e2;X71c8e73cc;X741c3e182;X794b98f6e;X84d313e5c;X8b0581d67;X8b1aa0b95;X91f4e6ae7;X9898ffe69;X9bacaaf39;X9c4d175ae;Xa013b3478;Xa181cdfbb;Xa6c090abb;Xa7856da67;Xac0ee97e4;Xaed5f7894;Xc7ee2da1f;Xd1f30b564;Xe09905de8;Xe676c2b33;Xefede5adb;Xf25f2a8ad;Xf41c182e5;Xf7eec358b;Xfa53f7843;Xfb1e0f0f8,53,Finite Element Based Tracking of Deforming Surfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4478,2013

By applying only transparency or intensity projection, and ignoring light-matter interaction, results will likely fail to give optimal results. Little research has been done on using reflectance functions to visually separate the various segments of a MRI volume. We will explore if applying specific reflectance functions to individual anatomical structures can help in building an intuitive 2D image from a 3D dataset. We will test our hypothesis by visualizing a statistical analysis of the genetic influences on variations in human brain morphology because it inherently contains complex and many different types of data making it a good candidate for our approach","Koldenhof, Gibby",ArXiv e-prints,"[X29dc52530, X8ece71ed3, Xd746cb651]",X29dc52530;X8ece71ed3;Xd746cb651,3,Visualization of variations in human brain morphology using differentiating reflection functions,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0311034,2003

The instability of the medial axis transform is overcome by a pruning algorithm guided by a user-defined Hausdorff distance threshold. The stable medial axis transform is then approximated by spline curves in 3D to produce a smooth and compact representation. These spline curves are computed by minimizing the approximation error between the input shape and the shape represented by the medial axis transform. Our results on various 2D shapes suggest that our method is practical and effective, and yields faithful and compact representations of medial axis transforms of 2D shapes.","Zhu, Yanshu;Sun, Feng;Choi, Yi-King;Jüttler, Bert;Wang, Wenping",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0bd6759b6, X1d878ab0e, X1ebd2adcd, X361270cb7, X3ed6192d0, X50f42281b, X59ffb11fc, X7091ceaf8, X718a4d5d5, X8ad546571, X8c7d8805e, X8f040f906, Xbd1adcf05, Xc193a139f, Xc23a7ee67, Xc4c4d66a6, Xd4e423985, Xd7f3d1b4b, Xd857ebf4f, Xf03caaeb3, Xf10d54612, Xf73b2cc67]",X0bd6759b6;X1d878ab0e;X1ebd2adcd;X361270cb7;X3ed6192d0;X50f42281b;X59ffb11fc;X7091ceaf8;X718a4d5d5;X8ad546571;X8c7d8805e;X8f040f906;Xbd1adcf05;Xc193a139f;Xc23a7ee67;Xc4c4d66a6;Xd4e423985;Xd7f3d1b4b;Xd857ebf4f;Xf03caaeb3;Xf10d54612;Xf73b2cc67,22,Computing a Compact Spline Representation of the Medial Axis Transform of a 2D Shape,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0118,2013

89,"3D model retrieval techniques can be classified as histogram-based, view-based and graph-based approaches. We propose a hybrid shape descriptor which combines the global and local radial distance features by utilizing the histogram-based and view-based approaches respectively. We define an area-weighted global radial distance with respect to the center of the bounding sphere of the model and encode its distribution into a 2D histogram as the global radial distance shape descriptor. We then uniformly divide the bounding cube of a 3D model into a set of small cubes and define their centers as local centers. Then, we compute the local radial distance of a point based on the nearest local center. By sparsely sampling a set of views and encoding the local radial distance feature on the rendered views by color coding, we extract the local radial distance shape descriptor. Based on these two shape descriptors, we develop a hybrid radial distance shape descriptor for 3D model retrieval. Experiment results show that our hybrid shape descriptor outperforms several typical histogram-based and view-based approaches.","Li, Bo;Johan, Henry",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0a8ae61c7, X0f476383a, X10821e8e2, X13ea1d266, X1fc11da55, X309df470a, X5a5efc2d6, X6ab4e099f, X6ad91124b, X73af3a965, X8b409f409, X8e5091779, X93d53bbec, Xb4005c8eb, Xc4aabc797, Xc9bf07101, Xcb43f6430]",X0a8ae61c7;X0f476383a;X10821e8e2;X13ea1d266;X1fc11da55;X309df470a;X5a5efc2d6;X6ab4e099f;X6ad91124b;X73af3a965;X8b409f409;X8e5091779;X93d53bbec;Xb4005c8eb;Xc4aabc797;Xc9bf07101;Xcb43f6430,17,3D model retrieval using global and local radial distances,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2081,2013
90,"Nowadays three dimension (3D) architectural visualisation has become a powerful tool in the conceptualisation, design and presentation of architectural products in the construction industry, providing realistic interaction and walkthrough on engineering products. Traditional ways of implementing 3D models involves the use of specialised 3D authoring tools along with skilled 3D designers with blueprints of the model and this is a slow and laborious process. The aim of this paper is to automate this process by simply analyzing the blueprint document and generating the 3D scene automatically. For this purpose we have devised a 3-Phase recognition approach to pseudo 3D building generation from 2D floor plan and developed a software accordingly. Our 3-phased 3D building system has been implemented using C, C++ and OpenCV library [24] for the Image Processing module; The Save Module generated an XML file for storing the processed floor plan objects attributes; while the Irrlitch [14] game engine was used to implement the Interactive 3D module. Though still at its infancy, our proposed system gave commendable results. We tested our system on 6 floor plans with complexities ranging from low to high and the results seems to be very promising with an average processing time of around 3s and a 3D generation in 4s.

91,"We present a novel methodology that utilizes 4-Dimensional (4D) space deformation to simulate a magnification lens on versatile volume datasets and textured solid models. Compared with other magnification methods (e.g., geometric optics, mesh editing), 4D differential geometry theory and its practices are much more flexible and powerful for preserving shape features (i.e., minimizing angle distortion), and easier to adapt to versatile solid models. The primary advantage of 4D space lies at the following fact: we can now easily magnify the volume of regions of interest (ROIs) from the additional dimension, while keeping the rest region unchanged. To achieve this primary goal, we first embed a 3D volumetric input into 4D space and magnify ROIs in the 4th dimension. Then we flatten the 4D shape back into 3D space to accommodate other typical applications in the real 3D world. In order to enforce distortion minimization, in both steps we devise the high dimensional geometry techniques based on rigorous 4D geometry theory for 3D/4D mapping back and forth to amend the distortion. Our system can preserve not only focus region, but also context region and global shape.

The methodology used to validate it, taking as a basis to compare the values measured by the program, as well as the theoretical values expected according to the model of a simple pendulum. The experiment is appropriate to the method because it was built within the limits of the linear harmonic oscillator and energy losses due to friction had been minimized, making it the most ideal possible.

94,"In this paper, a color transfer framework to evoke different emotions for images based on color combinations is proposed. The purpose of this color transfer is to change the ""look and feel"" of images, i.e., evoking different emotions. Colors are confirmed as the most attractive factor in images. In addition, various studies in both art and science areas have concluded that other than single color, color combinations are necessary to evoke specific emotions. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to transfer color of images based on color combinations, using a predefined color emotion model. The contribution of this new framework is three-fold. First, users do not need to provide reference images as used in traditional color transfer algorithms. In most situations, users may not have enough aesthetic knowledge or path to choose desired reference images. Second, because of the usage of color combinations instead of single color for emotions, a new color transfer algorithm that does not require an image library is proposed. Third, again because of the usage of color combinations, artifacts that are normally seen in traditional frameworks using single color are avoided. We present encouraging results generated from this new framework and its potential in several possible applications including color transfer of photos and paintings.","He, Li;Qi, Hairong;Zaretzki, Russell",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0077140a2, X04ee94263, X0505af74d, X073f5505d, X078474ab0, X0da26c262, X0f752b027, X101e4bbfa, X1119fb1a3, X1249e04ce, X12ebe9b9d, X13353b51a, X136a790c2, X173e7b753, X189d5f427, X1a487e9e6, X1ecc67e71, X257fb235a, X271d241ef, X278f52ae5, X2813a084a, X2a8e8d8c3, X36aac560e, X389223031, X393bf8147, X3a0e2dfed, X404756cbc, X44242c553, X4767b2f57, X4b1cd2cb9, X4c22a07e8, X4c411af61, X4e8b25d54, X4f8d315c0, X50e6ebb99, X50fe45558, X5109229dd, X5116b87f9, X52eacfd05, X52f75219a, X551fc75c5, X5b743a8f6, X5d16a4d14, X5f14a441e, X5fc9cc5a9, X61e16395a, X63422a42b, X698c317e1, X6a0960889, X6fc6944d8, X7308d87e9, X732d77e38, X73838db58, X76fafdf76, X77af1fbea, X7950021ff, X7a7fb236f, X7d0984453, X86642db3d, X88299abba, X8854861aa, X903b94163, X9084a70c2, X93ea698c5, X977c5497e, X9d27e40b4, X9e8622433, X9efa4da78, Xa169531d9, Xa31e708e5, Xa4ccb8e25, Xa55c11499, Xa56650479, Xa948ff745, Xb2e1ca2ec, Xb401d245e, Xb47e01305, Xbc79c5827, Xbe4e39122, Xc493f4b3e, Xc5308f301, Xc6fe15fa9, Xc73b9e8bc, Xd0fd12e4c, Xd92e783fe, Xd9c7d4e70, Xda0443291, Xdc32a33b7, Xdfc28924e, Xe06c8c17d, Xe1c7167e0, Xe1e3fd8e8, Xea626a185, Xf2c2a6e30, Xf446d2efc, Xf6c754bb4, Xf7a17e76a, Xf80e7eef9, Xf81b53135, Xfaa4d539d, ...]",X0077140a2;X04ee94263;X0505af74d;X073f5505d;X078474ab0;X0da26c262;X0f752b027;X101e4bbfa;X1119fb1a3;X1249e04ce;X12ebe9b9d;X13353b51a;X136a790c2;X173e7b753;X189d5f427;X1a487e9e6;X1ecc67e71;X257fb235a;X271d241ef;X278f52ae5;X2813a084a;X2a8e8d8c3;X36aac560e;X389223031;X393bf8147;X3a0e2dfed;X404756cbc;X44242c553;X4767b2f57;X4b1cd2cb9;X4c22a07e8;X4c411af61;X4e8b25d54;X4f8d315c0;X50e6ebb99;X50fe45558;X5109229dd;X5116b87f9;X52eacfd05;X52f75219a;X551fc75c5;X5b743a8f6;X5d16a4d14;X5f14a441e;X5fc9cc5a9;X61e16395a;X63422a42b;X698c317e1;X6a0960889;X6fc6944d8;X7308d87e9;X732d77e38;X73838db58;X76fafdf76;X77af1fbea;X7950021ff;X7a7fb236f;X7d0984453;X86642db3d;X88299abba;X8854861aa;X903b94163;X9084a70c2;X93ea698c5;X977c5497e;X9d27e40b4;X9e8622433;X9efa4da78;Xa169531d9;Xa31e708e5;Xa4ccb8e25;Xa55c11499;Xa56650479;Xa948ff745;Xb2e1ca2ec;Xb401d245e;Xb47e01305;Xbc79c5827;Xbe4e39122;Xc493f4b3e;Xc5308f301;Xc6fe15fa9;Xc73b9e8bc;Xd0fd12e4c;Xd92e783fe;Xd9c7d4e70;Xda0443291;Xdc32a33b7;Xdfc28924e;Xe06c8c17d;Xe1c7167e0;Xe1e3fd8e8;Xea626a185;Xf2c2a6e30;Xf446d2efc;Xf6c754bb4;Xf7a17e76a;Xf80e7eef9;Xf81b53135;Xfaa4d539d;Xfe55ac6f1,101,Image color transfer to evoke different emotions based on color combinations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3581,2013
95,"Radiological imaging of prostate is becoming more popular among researchers and clinicians in searching for diseases, primarily cancer. Scans might be acquired at different times, with patient movement between scans, or with different equipment, resulting in multiple datasets that need to be registered. For this issue, we introduce a registration method using anatomical feature-guided mutual information. Prostate scans of the same patient taken in three different orientations are first aligned for the accurate detection of anatomical features in 3D. Then, our pipeline allows for multiple modalities registration through the use of anatomical features, such as the interior urethra of prostate and gland utricle, in a bijective way. The novelty of this approach is the application of anatomical features as the pre-specified corresponding landmarks for prostate registration. We evaluate the registration results through both artificial and clinical datasets. Registration accuracy is evaluated by performing statistical analysis of local intensity differences or spatial differences of anatomical landmarks between various MR datasets. Evaluation results demonstrate that our method statistics-significantly improves the quality of registration. Although this strategy is tested for MRI-guided brachytherapy, the preliminary results from these experiments suggest that it can be also applied to other settings such as transrectal ultrasound-guided or CT-guided therapy, where the integration of preoperative MRI may have a significant impact upon treatment planning and guidance.","Zhao, Xin;Kaufman, Arie",ArXiv e-prints,"[54febd7a47, X2f9283f91]",54febd7a47;X2f9283f91,2,Anatomical Feature-guided Volumeric Registration of Multimodal Prostate MRI,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1739,2013

98,"The latest Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are reported to reach up to 200 billion floating point operations per second (200 Gflops) and to have price performance of 0.1 cents per M flop. These facts raise great interest in the plausibility of extending the GPUs' use to non-graphics applications, in particular numerical simulations on structured grids (lattice). We review previous work on using GPUs for non-graphics applications, implement probability-based simulations on the GPU, namely the Ising and percolation models, implement vector operation benchmarks for the GPU, and finally compare the CPU's and GPU's performance. A general conclusion from the results obtained is that moving computations from the CPU to the GPU is feasible, yielding good time and price performance, for certain lattice computations.

Our aim is to promote new applications of powerful geometric modeling techniques in visual computing. Conventional image processing/visualization methods are computed in two dimensional space (2D). We examine this conventional 2D manipulation from a completely innovative perspective of 3D geometric processing. Compared with conventional optical lens design, 3D geometric method are much more capable of preserving shape features and minimizing distortion. We magnify an area of interest to better visualize the interior details, while keeping the rest of area without perceivable distortion. We flatten the mesh back into 2D space for viewing, and further applications in the screen space. In both steps, we devise an iterative deformation scheme to minimize distortion around both focus and context region, while avoiding the noncontinuous transition region between the focus and context areas. Particularly, our method allows the user to flexibly modify the ROI shapes to accommodate complex feature. The user can also easily specify a spectrum of metrics for different visual effects.

102,"A calculation reduction method for color digital holography (DH) and computer-generated holograms (CGHs) using color space conversion is reported. Color DH and color CGHs are generally calculated on RGB space. We calculate color DH and CGHs in other color spaces for accelerating the calculation (e.g., YCbCr color space). In YCbCr color space, a RGB image or RGB hologram is converted to the luminance component (Y), blue-difference chroma (Cb), and red-difference chroma (Cr) components. In terms of the human eye, although the negligible difference of the luminance component is well recognized, the difference of the other components is not. In this method, the luminance component is normal sampled and the chroma components are down-sampled. The down-sampling allows us to accelerate the calculation of the color DH and CGHs. We compute diffraction calculations from the components, and then we convert the diffracted results in YCbCr color space to RGB color space. The proposed method, which is possible to accelerate the calculations up to a factor of 3 in theory, accelerates the calculation over two times faster than the ones in RGB color space.","Shimobaba, Tomoyoshi;Nagahama, Yuki;Kakue, Takashi;Takada, Naoki;Okada, Naohisa;Endo, Yutaka;Hirayama, Ryuji;Hiyama, Daisuke;Ito, Tomoyoshi",Optical Engineering,"[X17f5c46fb, X29d6c83e8, X2d5b94028, X3a4ff0cf9, X412896c54, X435eb04cf, X4f4ebda8b, X5431498fb, X579f04b26, X591997252, X632e460e9, X811624622, X8ce1a1338, X93af2bdb9, Xa9fe5c7b3, Xb5afdd6ec, Xbe0730c4a, Xc6fd424ac, Xd4d056e2a, Xd611b05c3, Xd8e1637c8, Xddec649ef, Xe0750a593, Xe85e871e6, Xefa99e201, Xfab5e6f21, Xfb61c617b]",X17f5c46fb;X29d6c83e8;X2d5b94028;X3a4ff0cf9;X412896c54;X435eb04cf;X4f4ebda8b;X5431498fb;X579f04b26;X591997252;X632e460e9;X811624622;X8ce1a1338;X93af2bdb9;Xa9fe5c7b3;Xb5afdd6ec;Xbe0730c4a;Xc6fd424ac;Xd4d056e2a;Xd611b05c3;Xd8e1637c8;Xddec649ef;Xe0750a593;Xe85e871e6;Xefa99e201;Xfab5e6f21;Xfb61c617b,27,Calculation reduction method for color digital holography and computer-generated hologram using color space conversion,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0376,2014
103,"In this paper a novel spatial domain LSB based watermarking scheme for color Images is proposed. The proposed scheme is of type blind and invisible watermarking. Our scheme introduces the concept of storing variable number of bits in each pixel based on the actual color value of pixel. Equal or higher the color value of channels with respect to intensity of pixel stores higher number of watermark bits. The Red, Green and Blue channel of the color image has been used for watermark embedding. The watermark is embedded into selected channels of pixel. The proposed method supports high watermark embedding capacity, which is equivalent to the size of cover image. The security of watermark is preserved by permuting the watermark bits using secret key. The proposed scheme is found robust to various image processing operations such as image compression, blurring, salt and pepper noise, filtering and cropping.","Dharwadkar, Nagaraj V.;Amberker, B.

104,"The rapid advances in 3D scanning and acquisition techniques have given rise to the explosive increase of volumetric digital models in recent years. This dissertation systematically trailblazes a novel volumetric modeling framework to represent 3D solids. The need to explore more efficient and robust 3D modeling framework has gained the prominence. Although the traditional surface representation (e.g., triangle mesh) has many attractive properties, it is incapable of expressing the interior space and materials. Such a serious drawback overshadows many potential modeling and analysis applications. Consequently volumetric modeling techniques become the well-known solution to this problem. Nevertheless, many unsolved research issues remain when developing an efficient modeling paradigm for existing 3D models: complex geometry (fine details and extreme concaveness), arbitrary topology, heterogenous materials, large-scale data storage and processing, etc.","Li, Bo",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0f8edbea9, X12ada4510, X15d8f608b, X1d454ae6d, X4e7b467ae, X6918db166, X696daaa44, X6cedd1473, X70b8dc064, X78d6c882d, X804d5af6b, X81ea31db4, X8c446fdca, X900d1dc30, X9a38d521b, Xb58c8c2a4, Xbe4e39122, Xd246e445c, Xe306f15c2, Xf0cec6e61]",X0f8edbea9;X12ada4510;X15d8f608b;X1d454ae6d;X4e7b467ae;X6918db166;X696daaa44;X6cedd1473;X70b8dc064;X78d6c882d;X804d5af6b;X81ea31db4;X8c446fdca;X900d1dc30;X9a38d521b;Xb58c8c2a4;Xbe4e39122;Xd246e445c;Xe306f15c2;Xf0cec6e61,20,A Survey of Spline-based Volumetric Data Modeling Framework and Its Applications,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0867,2013

108,"This paper presents two approaches for filter design based on stochastic distances for intensity speckle reduction. A window is defined around each pixel, overlapping samples are compared and only those which pass a goodness-of-fit test are used to compute the filtered value. The tests stem from stochastic divergences within the Information Theory framework. The technique is applied to intensity Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with homogeneous regions using the Gamma model. The first approach uses a Nagao-Matsuyama-type procedure for setting the overlapping samples, and the second uses the nonlocal method. The proposals are compared with the Improved Sigma filter and with anisotropic diffusion for speckled data (SRAD) using a protocol based on Monte Carlo simulation. Among the criteria used to quantify the quality of filters, we employ the equivalent number of looks, and line and edge preservation. Moreover, we also assessed the filters by the Universal Image Quality Index and by the Pearson correlation between edges. Applications to real images are also discussed.

The problem is about computing an accurate and compact approximate representation of 3D volumes using some simple primitives. In this study, we propose a new volume representation, called medial meshes, and present an efficient method for its computation. Specifically, we use the union of a novel type of simple volume primitives, which are spheres and the convex hulls of two or three spheres, to approximate a given 3D shape. We compute such a volume approximation based on a new method for medial axis simplification guided by Hausdorff errors.

However, such systems pose several challenges for HDR reconstruction algorithms. Previous reconstruction techniques have considered debayering, denoising, resampling (align- ment) and exposure fusion as separate problems. In contrast, in this paper we present a unifying approach, performing HDR assembly directly from raw sensor data. Our framework includes a camera noise model adapted to HDR video and an algorithm for spatially adaptive HDR reconstruction based on fitting of local polynomial approximations to observed sensor data. The method is easy to implement and allows reconstruction to an arbitrary resolution and output mapping.

112,"We implement for comparative purposes the Feynman algorithm within a C++-based framework for two-layer uniform facet elastic object for real-time softbody simulation based on physics modeling methods. To facilitate the comparison, we implement initial timing measurements on the same hardware against that of Euler integrator in the softbody framework by varying different algorithm parameters. Due to a relatively large number of such variations we implement a GLUI-based user-interface to allow for much more finer control over the simulation process at real-time, which was lacking completely in the previous versions of the framework. We show our currents results based on the enhanced framework. The two-layered elastic object consists of inner and outer elastic mass-spring surfaces and compressible internal pressure. The density of the inner layer can be set differently from the density of the outer layer; the motion of the inner layer can be opposite to the motion of the outer layer. These special features, which cannot be achieved by a single layered object, result in improved imitation of a soft body, such as tissue's liquid non-uniform deformation. The inertial behavior of the elastic object is well illustrated in environments with gravity and collisions with walls, ceiling, and floor. The collision detection is defined by elastic collision penalty method and the motion of the object is guided by the Ordinary Differential Equation computation. Users can interact with the modeled objects, deform them, and observe the response to their action in real-time and we provide an extensible framework and its implementation for comparative studies of different physical-based modeling and integration algorithm implementations.","Song, Miao",ArXiv e-prints,"[X54e9124f3, Xd3659b7a5, Xed692cfb4]",X54e9124f3;Xd3659b7a5;Xed692cfb4,3,Feynman Algorithm Implementation for Comparison with Euler in a Uniform Elastic Two-Layer 2D and 3D Object Dynamic Deformation Framework in OpenGL with GUI,http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3074,2009

117,The applicability of Virtual Reality for evaluating engineering analysis results is beginning to receive increased appreciation in the last years. The problem many engineers are still facing is how to import their model together with the analysis results in a virtual reality environment for exploration and results validation. In this paper we propose an algorithm for transforming model data and results from finite element analysis (FEA) solving application to a format easily interpretable by a virtual reality application. The algorithm includes also steps for reducing the face-count of the resulting mesh by eliminating faces from the inner part of the model in the cases when only the surfaces of the model is analyzed. We also describe a possibility for simultaneously assessing multiple analysis results relying on multimodal results presentation by stimulating different senses of the operator.,"Maleshkov, Stoyan;Chotrov, Dimo",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0ed528d0b, X1423e91b4, X31e0f9469, X393fe7fe6, X3a82df0db, X3ba3d90dc, X3d88c083b, X455e60b5b, X49cf1d52b, X4cee84a09, X57ecb22f3, X5bbf9a057, X5f8ffb126, X606d4b7ed, X718847f3b, X73f23148a, X7483f192c, X7e9d97e2e, X8735fde0a, X87c7828f3, X87c814b41, X8f0c18d23, Xae84be659, Xaf79e376f, Xb11817dcf, Xb14241e86, Xb438ed214, Xb5445b69a, Xb6c20aed7, Xba9482f45, Xc10942078, Xc4b7d8c90, Xd34e32721, Xe2c858a24, Xe5e689956, Xe9dc26b0b, Xeb79a0d0b, Xf30457acf, Xf76fbed31, Xf8e1f12c0, Xf8ee50eb7, Xfc3dbc7fe]",X0ed528d0b;X1423e91b4;X31e0f9469;X393fe7fe6;X3a82df0db;X3ba3d90dc;X3d88c083b;X455e60b5b;X49cf1d52b;X4cee84a09;X57ecb22f3;X5bbf9a057;X5f8ffb126;X606d4b7ed;X718847f3b;X73f23148a;X7483f192c;X7e9d97e2e;X8735fde0a;X87c7828f3;X87c814b41;X8f0c18d23;Xae84be659;Xaf79e376f;Xb11817dcf;Xb14241e86;Xb438ed214;Xb5445b69a;Xb6c20aed7;Xba9482f45;Xc10942078;Xc4b7d8c90;Xd34e32721;Xe2c858a24;Xe5e689956;Xe9dc26b0b;Xeb79a0d0b;Xf30457acf;Xf76fbed31;Xf8e1f12c0;Xf8ee50eb7;Xfc3dbc7fe,42,Post-processing of Engineering Analysis Results for Visualization in VR Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5847,2013
118,"We study the uniqueness and accuracy of the numerical solution of the problem of reconstruction of the shape and trajectory of a reflecting obstacle moving in an inhomogeneous medium from travel times, start and end points, and initial angles of ultrasonic rays reflecting at the obstacle. The speed of sound in the domain when there is no obstacle present is known and provided as an input parameter which together with the other initial data enables the algorithm to trace ray paths and find their reflection points. The reflection points determine with high-resolution the shape and trajectory of the obstacle. The method has predictable computational complexity and performance and is very efficient when it is parallelized and optimized because only a small portion of the domain is reconstructed.","Lozev, Kamen M.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X253dbfaa4, Xc02f216b2, Xcb5664d29]",X253dbfaa4;Xc02f216b2;Xcb5664d29,3,Reconstruction and uniqueness of moving obstacles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0192,2013
119,"Intrinsic isometric shape matching has become the standard approach for pose invariant correspondence estimation among deformable shapes. Most existing approaches assume global consistency, i.e., the metric structure of the whole manifold must not change significantly. While global isometric matching is well understood, only a few heuristic solutions are known for partial matching. Partial matching is particularly important for robustness to topological noise (incomplete data and contacts), which is a common problem in real-world 3D scanner data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to partial, intrinsic isometric matching. Our method is based on the observation that isometries are fully determined by purely local information: a map of a single point and its tangent space fixes an isometry for both global and the partial maps. From this idea, we develop a new representation for partial isometric maps based on equivalence classes of correspondences between pairs of points and their tangent spaces. From this, we derive a local propagation algorithm that find such mappings efficiently. In contrast to previous heuristics based on RANSAC or expectation maximization, our method is based on a simple and sound theoretical model and fully deterministic. We apply our approach to register partial point clouds and compare it to the state-of-the-art methods, where we obtain significant improvements over global methods for real-world data and stronger guarantees than previous heuristic partial matching algorithms.","Brunton, Alan;Wand, Michael;Wuhrer, Stefanie;Seidel, Hans-Peter;Weinkauf, Tino",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00fa7a190, X1ca901641, X1e144dba3, X707be21e7, X70930f047, X71c8e73cc, X7b549f935, X8b0581d67, X96f2e38b3, Xa92b9871f, Xb06de67d2, Xb58c8c2a4, Xc10942078, Xcc9f26315, Xd37773da3, Xd81de5005, Xdb713d31d, Xfa53f7843]",X00fa7a190;X1ca901641;X1e144dba3;X707be21e7;X70930f047;X71c8e73cc;X7b549f935;X8b0581d67;X96f2e38b3;Xa92b9871f;Xb06de67d2;Xb58c8c2a4;Xc10942078;Xcc9f26315;Xd37773da3;Xd81de5005;Xdb713d31d;Xfa53f7843,18,A Low-Dimensional Representation for Robust Partial Isometric Correspondences Computation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6804,2013
120,"Classical ghost imaging has received considerable attention in recent years because of its remarkable ability to image a scene without direct observation by a light-detecting imaging device. In this article, we show that this imaging process is actually a realization of a paradigm known as dual photography, which has been shown to produce full-color dual (ghost) images of 3D objects with complex materials without using a traditional imaging device. Specifically, we demonstrate mathematically that the cross-correlation based methods used to recover ghost images are equivalent to the light transport measurement process of dual photography. Because of this, we are able to provide a new explanation for ghost imaging using only classical optics by leveraging the principle of reciprocity in classical electromagnetics. This observation also shows how to leverage previous work on light transport acquisition and dual photography to improve ghost imaging systems in the future.","Sen, Pradeep",ArXiv e-prints,"[X075926efe, X26268238c, X2f0f9c6b1, X4a5c1fd62, X56e623a3a, X8032a7c12, X90348aaec, Xafc5ece67, Xbc79c5827, Xc089c5ac2, Xef1dd06c9, Xf7005d94b, Xfc4ec6986, Xfe5534078]",X075926efe;X26268238c;X2f0f9c6b1;X4a5c1fd62;X56e623a3a;X8032a7c12;X90348aaec;Xafc5ece67;Xbc79c5827;Xc089c5ac2;Xef1dd06c9;Xf7005d94b;Xfc4ec6986;Xfe5534078,14,On the Relationship Between Dual Photography and Classical Ghost Imaging,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3007,2013

125,"The recent advances in 3-D imaging technologies give rise to databases of human shapes, from which statistical shape models can be built. These statistical models represent prior knowledge of the human shape and enable us to solve shape reconstruction problems from partial information. Generating human shape from traditional anthropometric measurements is such a problem, since these 1-D measurements encode 3-D shape information. Combined with a statistical shape model, these easy-to-obtain measurements can be leveraged to create 3D human shapes. However, existing methods limit the creation of the shapes to the space spanned by the database and thus require a large amount of training data. In this paper, we introduce a technique that extrapolates the statistically inferred shape to fit the measurement data using nonlinear optimization. This method ensures that the generated shape is both human-like and satisfies the measurement conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and compare it to existing approaches through extensive experiments, using both synthetic data and real human measurements.","Wuhrer, Stefanie;Shu, Chang",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00645148a, X00fa7a190, X0182383cd, X0250c0901, X02a6ae4d0, X02eece0d8, X0334ff701, X038bbe41b, X0396bc076, X04839c9ac, X0496431d5, X063ad339c, X092c7bfc7, X098647cba, X09a52062b, X0a05a2b34, X0a0617ab2, X0a7c04a52, X0b30fbadc, X0d26732d8, X0e4098c25, X0f31d3844, X10617850f, X1111d4717, X1131e2e4e, X12e3ffd83, X133207de6, X13a5d66bf, X13d2a7a77, X13d63d6d0, X13f54424e, X146a39568, X14893fdcb, X154f6cec0, X1601008b6, X1694e9069, X172926590, X177992aa7, X182de0664, X18aeebca9, X18dd8b814, X191be268d, X1b03afadb, X1babd3d4b, X1e62b28db, X1e92488dd, X215bd9531, X21e328a42, X2274cd0ce, X22e7ad70b, X22fa40249, X272842d09, X28945d201, X2a4f194fe, X2b4bf3e56, X2bd414e0b, X2c4d25242, X2ccd26e36, X2e0110ec8, X2e1511431, X2ec4975ca, X2eee679c6, X2ef0dfe1d, X2feedfe96, X313286848, X32dfa9d61, X331b08363, X33db96eaa, X35fc707e6, X36869b1bb, X37fe48d5f, X39873c8a3, X3b5fcaa6c, X3b6327929, X4125a0030, X43381b957, X434b5e455, X437f8daf0, X4429ca4f7, X4487a4123, X449265dfa, X45b1929ce, X46494f123, X46c39dcee, X48765fdee, X48d4e97c9, X4a7537a13, X4ab040308, X4b2f6c8d2, X4c28b62cc, X4c4035221, X4c8fbffcf, X4ce718d76, X4d0587bc1, X4d416b0e9, X4df0efb91, X4f8f90801, X4ff70dfcf, X502b7d563, X50ea74e96, ...]",X00645148a;X00fa7a190;X0182383cd;X0250c0901;X02a6ae4d0;X02eece0d8;X0334ff701;X038bbe41b;X0396bc076;X04839c9ac;X0496431d5;X063ad339c;X092c7bfc7;X098647cba;X09a52062b;X0a05a2b34;X0a0617ab2;X0a7c04a52;X0b30fbadc;X0d26732d8;X0e4098c25;X0f31d3844;X10617850f;X1111d4717;X1131e2e4e;X12e3ffd83;X133207de6;X13a5d66bf;X13d2a7a77;X13d63d6d0;X13f54424e;X146a39568;X14893fdcb;X154f6cec0;X1601008b6;X1694e9069;X172926590;X177992aa7;X182de0664;X18aeebca9;X18dd8b814;X191be268d;X1b03afadb;X1babd3d4b;X1e62b28db;X1e92488dd;X215bd9531;X21e328a42;X2274cd0ce;X22e7ad70b;X22fa40249;X272842d09;X28945d201;X2a4f194fe;X2b4bf3e56;X2bd414e0b;X2c4d25242;X2ccd26e36;X2e0110ec8;X2e1511431;X2ec4975ca;X2eee679c6;X2ef0dfe1d;X2feedfe96;X313286848;X32dfa9d61;X331b08363;X33db96eaa;X35fc707e6;X36869b1bb;X37fe48d5f;X39873c8a3;X3b5fcaa6c;X3b6327929;X4125a0030;X43381b957;X434b5e455;X437f8daf0;X4429ca4f7;X4487a4123;X449265dfa;X45b1929ce;X46494f123;X46c39dcee;X48765fdee;X48d4e97c9;X4a7537a13;X4ab040308;X4b2f6c8d2;X4c28b62cc;X4c4035221;X4c8fbffcf;X4ce718d76;X4d0587bc1;X4d416b0e9;X4df0efb91;X4f8f90801;X4ff70dfcf;X502b7d563;X50ea74e96;X51c899711;X537ff866e;X54869ed3e;X54fee859a;X55f8c5991;X5628bb06a;X56a42e0a7;X56e44baa7;X573598f19;X5768bc3c4;X58403e3aa;X5b4ec8106;X5c21160d5;X5caa37576;X5cbf0defc;X5ce75be78;X5e80b7edb;X5f5c9f004;X5fbc6d06a;X6235fae48;X62753567c;X62acc3a3d;X6322e0c54;X6588090ac;X65be46712;X65fb9787e;X66789d3cf;X67f70cf0a;X68ef9a265;X690f008dd;X6ab8d94e2;X6ebe246bd;X7022c1a51;X7115fae5f;X71413fbb5;X71c8e73cc;X735ceefc1;X741ae4223;X74930c1ce;X7654447d7;X7904e70df;X792bf4e1b;X795cdebee;X7a2ee39fc;X7ab4f12a8;X7bbbcffe2;X7cde71a13;X7f4011c2c;X810abd014;X8166e7e62;X818b68afb;X8280d207d;X845cb9d6f;X84e5d6a8c;X85892df6f;X859130881;X85ad6b756;X8658dbbae;X875783253;X87bd5868d;X87c14b0ac;X89202e971;X8985d2637;X8d6cccc13;X8e7254f35;X8f3caf4a3;X903967f76;X9199801d1;X91e01b2df;X94a3e0292;X94d96f35a;X95513648f;X96bf8020d;X97a2e02f6;X99781dcdf;X9987e59d1;X999059dc0;X99a46cfb8;X99e018704;X9bd57348e;X9c5e24a41;X9fa519610;Xa0d030ee6;Xa3b5b3b02;Xa4a8ac029;Xa62dc0116;Xa65a25bb6;Xa73cf9da6;Xa768a482b;Xa8b5b5972;Xa8d777495;Xaa8ed1ec0;Xabbcaa6a0;Xac37e917b;Xad3e16c2d;Xad491b311;Xad51e7bb2;Xaed5f7894;Xafbf213a4;Xb4c99add3;Xb58a39e77;Xba0d4831a;Xba16daa4e;Xba2afd0fc;Xbaee80fae;Xbcebac8c3;Xbcfd07eb9;Xbd4e4fe35;Xbe2eaa6e6;Xbeb8063e8;Xbef977863;Xbf65e2b27;Xbf6b11ebf;Xc01213e6e;Xc03f4995e;Xc1054d9f6;Xc190531b1;Xc19f4fd0f;Xc1de6844a;Xc263f693a;Xc42a76095;Xc5abe8588;Xc71ceb8fe;Xc806fedf3;Xc83254757;Xc8b21a105;Xca135b8c4;Xcbc1839c2;Xcc56b325c;Xceb69c0f0;Xd07e5af90;Xd1909851a;Xd1952e90e;Xd19ca47b0;Xd2a41a3dd;Xd2aef61c8;Xd3892c60d;Xd52a84e8a;Xd57e352ca;Xd6ba98aed;Xd93e4f0be;Xdd0e7e06c;Xde72f6967;Xdfef364e3;Xe09905de8;Xe2c058c6d;Xe2e7624c3;Xe33e1a5b2;Xe34e373c4;Xe43af8ea9;Xe54ba3453;Xe66505ee0;Xe676c2b33;Xe68da32c7;Xe6c5caa94;Xe6c90482a;Xe768cd3e8;Xe76ef98fe;Xe86db6631;Xe89dced11;Xe95305e6c;Xe9e224af2;Xeb3531c2a;Xece9739b1;Xed1441944;Xed4f3eb9e;Xed87f4270;Xee1757997;Xef37408bf;Xf046f5223;Xf2a415c9b;Xf461060f9;Xf4c8e4af1;Xf7711afa5;Xf7eec358b;Xfa53f7843;Xfb1e0f0f8;Xfb415d0e3;Xfc7c0f150;Xfdaa7c5a7;Xff59fb28e,281,Estimating 3D Human Shapes from Measurements,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1175,2011
126,"In this paper we present closed-form solutions for efficiently updating the principal components of a set of $n$ points, when $m$ points are added or deleted from the point set. For both operations performed on a discrete point set in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we can compute the new principal components in $O(m)$ time for fixed $d$. This is a significant improvement over the commonly used approach of recomputing the principal components from scratch, which takes $O(n+m)$ time. An important application of the above result is the dynamical computation of bounding boxes based on principal component analysis. PCA bounding boxes are very often used in many fields, among others in computer graphics for collision detection and fast rendering. We have implemented and evaluated few algorithms for computing dynamically PCA bounding boxes in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In addition, we present closed-form solutions for computing dynamically principal components of continuous point sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. In both cases, discrete and continuous, to compute the new principal components, no additional data structures or storage are needed.","Dimitrov, Darko;Holst, Mathias;Knauer, Christian;Kriegel, Klaus",ArXiv e-prints,"[X02393aa10, X1afe1f37f, X75f086c9e, X8b08ac877, X9250a93c0, X930544021, Xb417a5d39, Xbbafc83f2, Xbfe704888, Xf37f3b68b]",X02393aa10;X1afe1f37f;X75f086c9e;X8b08ac877;X9250a93c0;X930544021;Xb417a5d39;Xbbafc83f2;Xbfe704888;Xf37f3b68b,10,Computing Principal Components Dynamically,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5380,2009
127,"A comprehensive framework for detection and characterization of overlapping intrinsic symmetry over 3D shapes is proposed. To identify prominent symmetric regions which overlap in space and vary in form, the proposed framework is decoupled into a Correspondence Space Voting procedure followed by a Transformation Space Mapping procedure. In the correspondence space voting procedure, significant symmetries are first detected by identifying surface point pairs on the input shape that exhibit local similarity in terms of their intrinsic geometry while simultaneously maintaining an intrinsic distance structure at a global level. Since different point pairs can share a common point, the detected symmetric shape regions can potentially overlap. To this end, a global intrinsic distance-based voting technique is employed to ensure the inclusion of only those point pairs that exhibit significant symmetry. In the transformation space mapping procedure, the Functional Map framework is employed to generate the final map of symmetries between point pairs. The transformation space mapping procedure ensures the retrieval of the underlying dense correspondence map throughout the 3D shape that follows a particular symmetry. Additionally, the formulation of a novel cost matrix enables the inner product to succesfully indicate the complexity of the underlying symmetry transformation. The proposed transformation space mapping procedure is shown to result in the formulation of a semi-metric symmetry space where each point in the space represents a specific symmetry transformation and the distance between points represents the complexity between the corresponding transformations. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can successfully process complex 3D shapes that possess rich symmetries.","Mukhopadhyay, Anirban;Bhandarkar, Suchendra M.;Porikli, Fatih",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00fa7a190, X03ade91b1, X1521aca01, X3904d8dc9, X50af7bc6f, X52c216fc3, X5347b6b0e, X5bece5f35, X6d4c5c3de, X933b93513, X96f2e38b3, Xb06ad3065, Xc37c2ee0f, Xcc680818e, Xef75b611a, Xf554688b6]",X00fa7a190;X03ade91b1;X1521aca01;X3904d8dc9;X50af7bc6f;X52c216fc3;X5347b6b0e;X5bece5f35;X6d4c5c3de;X933b93513;X96f2e38b3;Xb06ad3065;Xc37c2ee0f;Xcc680818e;Xef75b611a;Xf554688b6,16,Detection and Characterization of Intrinsic Symmetry,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7472,2013
128,"We propose a new gradient-domain technique for processing registered EM image stacks to remove the inter-image discontinuities while preserving intra-image detail. To this end, we process the image stack by first performing anisotropic diffusion to smooth the data along the slice axis and then solving a screened-Poisson equation within each slice to re-introduce the detail. The final image stack is both continuous across the slice axis (facilitating the tracking of information between slices) and maintains sharp details within each slice (supporting automatic feature detection). To support this editing, we describe the implementation of the first multigrid solver designed for efficient gradient domain processing of large, out-of-core, voxel grids.","Kazhdan, Michael;Burns, Randal;Kasthuri, Bobby;Lichtman, Jeff;Vogelstein, Jacob;Vogelstein, Joshua",ArXiv e-prints,"[550b1f1cac, X04af98486, X0ba2f819b, X101e4bbfa, X28a05654f, X2d58be24f, X33d5b9f4e, X38b3c4d35, X436d765c7, X4fe6db23b, X6859d3d8e, X7772b5f12, X7ee71f30d, X7f91b95df, X995e13295, Xac16da357, Xb43927fcf, Xb5095d579, Xf847509fc]",550b1f1cac;X04af98486;X0ba2f819b;X101e4bbfa;X28a05654f;X2d58be24f;X33d5b9f4e;X38b3c4d35;X436d765c7;X4fe6db23b;X6859d3d8e;X7772b5f12;X7ee71f30d;X7f91b95df;X995e13295;Xac16da357;Xb43927fcf;Xb5095d579;Xf847509fc,19,Gradient-Domain Processing for Large EM Image Stacks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0041,2013

130,"Registration, which aims to find an optimal one-to-one correspondence between different data, is an important problem in various fields. This problem is especially challenging when large deformations occur. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to obtain diffeomorphic image or surface registrations with large deformations via quasi-conformal maps. The basic idea is to minimize an energy functional involving a Beltrami coefficient term, which measures the distortion of the quasi-conformal map. The Beltrami coefficient effectively controls the bijectivity and smoothness of the registration, even with very large deformations. Using the proposed algorithm, landmark-based registration between images or surfaces can be effectively computed. The obtained registration is guaranteed to be diffeomorphic (1-1 and onto), even with a large deformation or large number of landmark constraints. The proposed algorithm can also be combined with matching intensity (such as image intensity or surface curvature) to improve the accuracy of the registration. Experiments have been carried out on both synthetic and real data. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm to obtain diffeomorphic registration between images or surfaces.","Chun, Lam Ka;Lui, Lok Ming",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01edea6a3, X0fb79f9e0, X2942ef2c4, X48890ade7, X63f421d36, X6dc67bde3, X776eb645c, X7a163054a, X7ac8bb2ae, X9862fe5e4, Xb066d3237, Xb58c8c2a4]",X01edea6a3;X0fb79f9e0;X2942ef2c4;X48890ade7;X63f421d36;X6dc67bde3;X776eb645c;X7a163054a;X7ac8bb2ae;X9862fe5e4;Xb066d3237;Xb58c8c2a4,12,Landmark and Intensity Based Registration with Large Deformations via Quasi-conformal Maps,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1710,2013

132,"We present the design and prototype implementation of a scientific visualization language called Zifazah for composing 3D visualizations of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI or DTI) data. Unlike existing tools allowing flexible customization of data visualizations that are programmer-oriented, we focus on domain scientists as end users in order to enable them to freely compose visualizations of their scientific data set. We analyzed end-user descriptions extracted from interviews with neurologists and physicians conducting clinical practices using DTI about how they would build and use DTI visualizations to collect syntax and semantics for the language design, and have discovered the elements and structure of the proposed language. Zifazah makes use of the initial set of lexical terms and semantics to provide a declarative language in the spirit of intuitive syntax and usage. This work contributes three, among others, main design principles for scientific visualization language design as well as a practice of such language for DTI visualization with Zifazah. First, Zifazah incorporated visual symbolic mapping based on color, size and shape, which is a sub-set of Bertin's taxonomy migrated to scientific visualizations. Second, Zifazah is defined as a spatial language whereby lexical representation of spatial relationship for 3D object visualization and manipulations, which is characteristic of scientific data, can be programmed. Third, built on top of Bertin's semiology, flexible data encoding specifically for scientific visualizations is integrated in our language in order to allow end users to achieve optimal visual composition at their best. Along with sample scripts representative of our language design features, some new DTI visualizations as the running results created by end users using the novel visualization language have also been presented.","Cai, Haipeng;Chen, Jian;Auchus, Alexander P.;Laidlaw, David H.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0fc414a19, X19f9eb619, X3b74aac49, X81379a928]",X0fc414a19;X19f9eb619;X3b74aac49;X81379a928,4,Composing DTI Visualizations with End-user Programming,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2923,2013
133,"We present a parallel visualization algorithm for the illustrative rendering of depth-dependent stylized dense tube data at interactive frame rates. While this computation could be efficiently performed on a GPU device, we target a parallel framework to enable it to be efficiently running on an ordinary multi-core CPU platform which is much more available than GPUs for common users. Our approach is to map the depth information in each tube onto each of the visual dimensions of shape, color, texture, value, and size on the basis of Bertin's semiology theory. The purpose is to enable more legible displays in the dense tube environments. A major contribution of our work is an efficient and effective parallel depthordering algorithm that makes use of the message passing interface (MPI) with VTK. We evaluated our framework with visualizations of depth-stylized tubes derived from 3D diffusion tensor MRI data by comparing its efficiency with several other alternative parallelization platforms running the same computations.

135,"A fundamental tool in shape analysis is the virtual embedding of the Riemannian manifold describing the geometry of a shape into Euclidean space. Several methods have been proposed to embed isometric shapes in flat domains while preserving distances measured on the manifold. Recently, attention has been given to embedding shapes into the eigenspace of the Lapalce-Beltrami operator. The Laplace-Beltrami eigenspace preserves the diffusion distance, and is invariant under isometric transformations. However, Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions computed independently for different shapes are often incompatible with each other. Applications involving multiple shapes, such as pointwise correspondence, would greatly benefit if their respective eigenfunctions were somehow matched. Here, we introduce a statistical approach for matching eigenfunctions. We consider the values of the eigenfunctions over the manifold as sampling of random variables, and try to match their multivariate distributions. Comparing distributions is done indirectly, using high order statistics. We show that the permutation and sign ambiguities of low order eigenfunctions, can be inferred by minimizing the difference of their third order moments. The sign ambiguities of antisymmetric eigenfunctions can be resolved by exploiting isometric invariant relations between the gradients of the eigenfunctions and the surface normal. We present experiments demonstrating the success of the proposed method applied to feature point correspondence.","Shtern, Alon;Kimmel, Ron",ArXiv e-prints,"[X4484cb9cc, X48da65ff4, X5c1ed67ea, X5e2850dd6, X659afa8fe, X94b10f260, X9bb438d78, Xbb17c65bd, Xe8d826339, Xee27720d7, Xfd197d3bf]",X4484cb9cc;X48da65ff4;X5c1ed67ea;X5e2850dd6;X659afa8fe;X94b10f260;X9bb438d78;Xbb17c65bd;Xe8d826339;Xee27720d7;Xfd197d3bf,11,Matching LBO eigenspace of non-rigid shapes via high order statistics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4459,2013
136,"Mappings between color spaces are ubiquitous in image processing problems such as gamut mapping, decolorization, and image optimization for color-blind people. Simple color transformations often result in information loss and ambiguities (for example, when mapping from RGB to grayscale), and one wishes to find an image-specific transformation that would preserve as much as possible the structure of the original image in the target color space. In this paper, we propose Laplacian colormaps, a generic framework for structure-preserving color transformations between images. We use the image Laplacian to capture the structural information, and show that if the color transformation between two images preserves the structure, the respective Laplacians have similar eigenvectors, or in other words, are approximately jointly diagonalizable. Employing the relation between joint diagonalizability and commutativity of matrices, we use Laplacians commutativity as a criterion of color mapping quality and minimize it w.r.t. the parameters of a color transformation to achieve optimal structure preservation. We show numerous applications of our approach, including color-to-gray conversion, gamut mapping, multispectral image fusion, and image optimization for color deficient viewers.","Eynard, Davide;Kovnatsky, Artiom;Bronstein, Michael M.",ArXiv e-prints,"[54d71333ee, X00fa7a190, X04fb68429, X055d3e64a, X0f16867ac, X11857df50, X1b6df7c87, X1ebd2adcd, X2337e994c, X2a0768f3a, X6310b8fdd, X7297d1a88, X73f4a0f7e, X7e3849e39, X8436ed371, X8b10595d0, X8cd17292f, X8f1dff333, X99f909b9c, Xa7af0cffa, Xae956cc0d, Xc723807c1, Xcc1860287, Xcf17123c5, Xd61450c5e, Xd856a1357, Xf1f46c184]",54d71333ee;X00fa7a190;X04fb68429;X055d3e64a;X0f16867ac;X11857df50;X1b6df7c87;X1ebd2adcd;X2337e994c;X2a0768f3a;X6310b8fdd;X7297d1a88;X73f4a0f7e;X7e3849e39;X8436ed371;X8b10595d0;X8cd17292f;X8f1dff333;X99f909b9c;Xa7af0cffa;Xae956cc0d;Xc723807c1;Xcc1860287;Xcf17123c5;Xd61450c5e;Xd856a1357;Xf1f46c184,27,Structure-preserving color transformations using Laplacian commutativity,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0119,2013
137,"Humans describe images in terms of nouns and adjectives while algorithms operate on images represented as sets of pixels. Bridging this gap between how humans would like to access images versus their typical representation is the goal of image parsing, which involves assigning object and attribute labels to pixel. In this paper we propose treating nouns as object labels and adjectives as visual attribute labels. This allows us to formulate the image parsing problem as one of jointly estimating per-pixel object and attribute labels from a set of training images. We propose an efficient (interactive time) solution. Using the extracted labels as handles, our system empowers a user to verbally refine the results. This enables hands-free parsing of an image into pixel-wise object/attribute labels that correspond to human semantics. Verbally selecting objects of interests enables a novel and natural interaction modality that can possibly be used to interact with new generation devices (e.g. smart phones, Google Glass, living room devices). We demonstrate our system on a large number of real-world images with varying complexity. To help understand the tradeoffs compared to traditional mouse based interactions, results are reported for both a large scale quantitative evaluation and a user study.","Cheng, Ming-Ming;Zheng, Shuai;Lin, Wen-Yan;Warrell, Jonathan;Vineet, Vibhav;Sturgess, Paul;Crook, Nigel;Mitra, Niloy;Torr, Philip",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00fa7a190, X0843741a0, X2a1b4b935, X2be4065ec, X2bf0c4128, X2d170f90f, X4634e3118, X479f6ec64, X4f8d315c0, X512317f48, X555283037, X57528c89f, X6c8c6c421, X734760a14, X76c20bc4c, X7d62cf0f3, X84047a825, X8891f065c, X8a57940da, X8d86f3ff9, X8db668ea9, X960bdb602, X96f2e38b3, X97b973913, X9c507b472, Xa3dc29716, Xae0a13dfc, Xb818640e5, Xb8760a2ed, Xbd1adcf05, Xc27b04178, Xc2b31338c, Xc6011cb9a, Xd07c3bce6, Xd151a424c, Xd189c8ee7, Xdad04bbd3, Xdda1559f7, Xdf411b318, Xe07d15cf3, Xe676c2b33, Xe9ef1b416, Xeac950482, Xed564d49a, Xf639d8515]",X00fa7a190;X0843741a0;X2a1b4b935;X2be4065ec;X2bf0c4128;X2d170f90f;X4634e3118;X479f6ec64;X4f8d315c0;X512317f48;X555283037;X57528c89f;X6c8c6c421;X734760a14;X76c20bc4c;X7d62cf0f3;X84047a825;X8891f065c;X8a57940da;X8d86f3ff9;X8db668ea9;X960bdb602;X96f2e38b3;X97b973913;X9c507b472;Xa3dc29716;Xae0a13dfc;Xb818640e5;Xb8760a2ed;Xbd1adcf05;Xc27b04178;Xc2b31338c;Xc6011cb9a;Xd07c3bce6;Xd151a424c;Xd189c8ee7;Xdad04bbd3;Xdda1559f7;Xdf411b318;Xe07d15cf3;Xe676c2b33;Xe9ef1b416;Xeac950482;Xed564d49a;Xf639d8515,45,ImageSpirit: Verbal Guided Image Parsing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4389,2013

We employ a Placzek's Lemma interpretation of the method of images and discard diffusion theory. Instead, we derive a plane-parallel transformation of the BSSRDF to form the associated BRDF and optimize the image confiurations such that the BRDF is close to the known analytic solutions for the associated albedo problem. This ensures reciprocity, accurate colors, and provides an automatic level-of-detail transition for translucent objects that appear at various distances in an image. Despite optimizing the subsurface fluence in a plane-parallel setting, we find that this also leads to fairly accurate fluence distributions throughout the volume in the original 3D searchlight problem.

140,"In this paper we consider query versions of visibility testing and visibility counting. Let $S$ be a set of $n$ disjoint line segments in $\R^2$ and let $s$ be an element of $S$. Visibility testing is to preprocess $S$ so that we can quickly determine if $s$ is visible from a query point $q$. Visibility counting involves preprocessing $S$ so that one can quickly estimate the number of segments in $S$ visible from a query point $q$. We present several data structures for the two query problems. The structures build upon a result by O'Rourke and Suri (1984) who showed that the subset, $V_S(s)$, of $\R^2$ that is weakly visible from a segment $s$ can be represented as the union of a set, $C_S(s)$, of $O(n^2)$ triangles, even though the complexity of $V_S(s)$ can be $\Omega(n^4)$. We define a variant of their covering, give efficient output-sensitive algorithms for computing it, and prove additional properties needed to obtain approximation bounds.

The resulting framework is validated by demonstrating how familiar information visualization concepts (such as literalness, sensitivity, redundancy, ambiguity, generalizability, and chart junk) arise naturally from it and can be defined formally and precisely.

142,"Triangle strips have been widely used for efficient rendering. It is NP-complete to test whether a given triangulated model can be represented as a single triangle strip, so many heuristics have been proposed to partition models into few long strips. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for creating a single triangle loop or strip from a triangulated model. Our method applies a dual graph matching algorithm to partition the mesh into cycles, and then merges pairs of cycles by splitting adjacent triangles when necessary. New vertices are introduced at midpoints of edges and the new triangles thus formed are coplanar with their parent triangles, hence the visual fidelity of the geometry is not changed. We prove that the increase in the number of triangles due to this splitting is 50% in the worst case, however for all models we tested the increase was less than 2%. We also prove tight bounds on the number of triangles needed for a single-strip representation of a model with holes on its boundary. Our strips can be used not only for efficient rendering, but also for other applications including the generation of space filling curves on a manifold of any arbitrary topology.","Gopi, M.;Eppstein, David",ArXiv e-prints,"[X2b22e73fb, X311a16087, X33f0ae7f9, X3bcb0dd03, X3bcb1b157, X555fda69a, X58b21101d, X78e71a25b, X7a97e5250, X83624bf97, Xa0b77a136, Xc78b8e5b9, Xd644febcd, Xe5b881be6, Xfcfdbd118]",X2b22e73fb;X311a16087;X33f0ae7f9;X3bcb0dd03;X3bcb1b157;X555fda69a;X58b21101d;X78e71a25b;X7a97e5250;X83624bf97;Xa0b77a136;Xc78b8e5b9;Xd644febcd;Xe5b881be6;Xfcfdbd118,15,Single-Strip Triangulation of Manifolds with Arbitrary Topology,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0405036,2004
143,"A standard way to approximate the distance between any two vertices $p$ and $q$ on a mesh is to compute, in the associated graph, a shortest path from $p$ to $q$ that goes through one of $k$ sources, which are well-chosen vertices. Precomputing the distance between each of the $k$ sources to all vertices of the graph yields an efficient computation of approximate distances between any two vertices. One standard method for choosing $k$ sources, which has been used extensively and successfully for isometry-invariant surface processing, is the so-called Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), which starts with a random vertex as the first source, and iteratively selects the farthest vertex from the already selected sources. In this paper, we analyze the stretch factor $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}$ of approximate geodesics computed using FPS, which is the maximum, over all pairs of distinct vertices, of their approximated distance over their geodesic distance in the graph. We show that $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}$ can be bounded in terms of the minimal value $\mathcal{F}^*$ of the stretch factor obtained using an optimal placement of $k$ sources as $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}\leq 2 r_e^2 \mathcal{F}^*+ 2 r_e^2 + 8 r_e + 1$, where $r_e$ is the ratio of the lengths of the longest and the shortest edges of the graph. This provides some evidence explaining why farthest point sampling has been used successfully for isometry-invariant shape processing.

Taking account all data transfer and computing time, the GPU version is about 400 times faster than the original CPU implementation, leading the approach to run at a real-time speed.","Song, Jian;Bian, Yatao;Yan, Junchi;Zhao, Xu;Liu, Yuncai",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01b1bb70f, X10bd9cf2e, X121033c22, X1fd7711da, X25cafbc79, X3f61dfcfd, X4f46bd650, X5587eb36f, X6497ffbf7, X7ef187acd, X7f95bf70d, X80973cd86, X842879103, X8789cb7f1, X93ca2c861, X96e3be201, Xaedc4dd22, Xaf3915707, Xbc4642ad1, Xbf7efbc53, Xbfae26f41, Xc71642d68, Xd551b088b, Xebe9eaa10]",X01b1bb70f;X10bd9cf2e;X121033c22;X1fd7711da;X25cafbc79;X3f61dfcfd;X4f46bd650;X5587eb36f;X6497ffbf7;X7ef187acd;X7f95bf70d;X80973cd86;X842879103;X8789cb7f1;X93ca2c861;X96e3be201;Xaedc4dd22;Xaf3915707;Xbc4642ad1;Xbf7efbc53;Xbfae26f41;Xc71642d68;Xd551b088b;Xebe9eaa10,24,Digitize Your Body and Action in 3-D at Over 10 FPS: Real Time Dense Voxel Reconstruction and Marker-less Motion Tracking via GPU Acceleration,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6811,2013
147,"In answer-set programming (ASP), the solutions of a problem are encoded in dedicated models, called answer sets, of a logical theory. These answer sets are computed from the program that represents the theory by means of an ASP solver and returned to the user as sets of ground first-order literals. As this type of representation is often cumbersome for the user to interpret, tools like ASPVIZ and IDPDraw were developed that allow for visualising answer sets. The tool Kara, introduced in this paper, follows these approaches, using ASP itself as a language for defining visualisations of interpretations. Unlike existing tools that position graphic primitives according to static coordinates only, Kara allows for more high-level specifications, supporting graph structures, grids, and relative positioning of graphical elements. Moreover, generalising the functionality of previous tools, Kara provides modifiable visualisations such that interpretations can be manipulated by graphically editing their visualisations. This is realised by resorting to abductive reasoning techniques. Kara is part of SeaLion, a forthcoming integrated development environment (IDE) for ASP.","Kloimüllner, Christian;Oetsch, Johannes;Pührer, Jörg;Tompits, Hans",ArXiv e-prints,"[X2beab8e95, X2c75a915e, X4ecfb11f6, X6862f254d, X9da0ec736, Xc3b649094, Xd45ba011c, Xfbfdca204]",X2beab8e95;X2c75a915e;X4ecfb11f6;X6862f254d;X9da0ec736;Xc3b649094;Xd45ba011c;Xfbfdca204,8,Kara: A System for Visualising and Visual Editing of Interpretations for Answer-Set Programs,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4095,2011
148,A system for live high quality surface reconstruction using a single moving depth camera on a commodity hardware is presented. High accuracy and real-time frame rate is achieved by utilizing graphics hardware computing capabilities via OpenCL and by using sparse data structure for volumetric surface representation. Depth sensor pose is estimated by combining serial texture registration algorithm with iterative closest points algorithm (ICP) aligning obtained depth map to the estimated scene model. Aligned surface is then fused into the scene. Kalman filter is used to improve fusion quality. Truncated signed distance function (TSDF) stored as block-based sparse buffer is used to represent surface. Use of sparse data structure greatly increases accuracy of scanned surfaces and maximum scanning area. Traditional GPU implementation of volumetric rendering and fusion algorithms were modified to exploit sparsity to achieve desired performance. Incorporation of texture registration for sensor pose estimation and Kalman filter for measurement integration improved accuracy and robustness of scanning process.,"Trifonov, Dmitry",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0182383cd, X0f0767377, X1415d6e7d, X1f233ffcc, X2218c47c7, X30ccda15b, X3581fa55c, X36f4bcb84, X37a51a50e, X3f82c45ef, X4096b3fca, X4176da9e4, X4aad0b23e, X55f36a17e, X5a1b98366, X632e460e9, X6689d69ee, X6ad5ab400, X6e5847a8b, X706073580, X73b0d05ee, X74178c10f, X79615437b, X7b3320ba4, X7dcfb5106, X8f0c18d23, X915a6c0cc, X940829c4c, X9ac846494, X9bc1dd261, X9f2c8318a, Xaa32ab378, Xab985ac77, Xac3c2050a, Xadca43677, Xb14dafde2, Xb69359cf8, Xc58c6df89, Xc6a6aa55d, Xc854f120c, Xda4bf09d6, Xe60077448, Xe7a2d1c3f, Xf11ed75ef, Xf1c7bf020, Xf521433c0, Xf8be24fc8, Xfe4f18eac, Xff267c2a0]",X0182383cd;X0f0767377;X1415d6e7d;X1f233ffcc;X2218c47c7;X30ccda15b;X3581fa55c;X36f4bcb84;X37a51a50e;X3f82c45ef;X4096b3fca;X4176da9e4;X4aad0b23e;X55f36a17e;X5a1b98366;X632e460e9;X6689d69ee;X6ad5ab400;X6e5847a8b;X706073580;X73b0d05ee;X74178c10f;X79615437b;X7b3320ba4;X7dcfb5106;X8f0c18d23;X915a6c0cc;X940829c4c;X9ac846494;X9bc1dd261;X9f2c8318a;Xaa32ab378;Xab985ac77;Xac3c2050a;Xadca43677;Xb14dafde2;Xb69359cf8;Xc58c6df89;Xc6a6aa55d;Xc854f120c;Xda4bf09d6;Xe60077448;Xe7a2d1c3f;Xf11ed75ef;Xf1c7bf020;Xf521433c0;Xf8be24fc8;Xfe4f18eac;Xff267c2a0,49,Real-time High Resolution Fusion of Depth Maps on GPU,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7194,2013

Such structures are found in electron--microscopy (EM) images of metal nanograins, which are widely used in the field of nanosensor technology. The topography of metal nanograins in compound nanomaterials is crucial to nanosensor characteristics. The method of completing such templates consists of three steps. In the first step, a local Gaussian filter is used with different weights for each neighborhood. In the second step, an adaptive morphology operation is applied to detect the endpoints of curve segments and connect them. In the last step, pruning is employed to extract a curve which optimally fits the template.","Spurek, P.;Chaikouskaya, A.;Tabor, J.;Zając, E.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X22cc28dc4, X396407ff4, X4327c26be, X53df84355, Xb6d0cc006, Xc4c7a2017, Xc5f2f532d]",X22cc28dc4;X396407ff4;X4327c26be;X53df84355;Xb6d0cc006;Xc4c7a2017;Xc5f2f532d,7,A local Gaussian filter and adaptive morphology as tools for completing partially discontinuous curves,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7430,2013

We study the continuous detection problem of a special type of CQM objects which are commonly used in CAD/CAM, that is, the boundary surfaces of such a CQM intersect only in straight line segments or conic curve segments. We present a framework for continuous collision detection (CCD) of this special type of CQM (which we also call CQM for brevity) in motion. We derive algebraic formulations and compute numerically the first contact time instants and the contact points of two moving CQMs in $\mathbb R^3$. Since it is difficult to process CCD of two CQMs in a direct manner because they are composed of semi-algebraic varieties, we break down the problem into subproblems of solving CCD of pairs of boundary elements of the CQMs. We present procedures to solve CCD of different types of boundary element pairs in different dimensions. Some CCD problems are reduced to their equivalents in a lower dimensional setting, where they can be solved more efficiently.","Choi, Yi-King;Wang, Wenping;Mourrain, Bernard;Tu, Changhe;Jia, Xiaohong;Sun, Feng",ArXiv e-prints,"[X2abb24e41, X404fcf4f3, Xa8f8ba34c, Xbd1adcf05]",X2abb24e41;X404fcf4f3;Xa8f8ba34c;Xbd1adcf05,4,Continuous Collision Detection for Composite Quadric Models,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7462,2013
151,"We consider the problem of establishing dense correspondences within a set of related shapes of strongly varying geometry. For such input, traditional shape matching approaches often produce unsatisfactory results. We propose an ensemble optimization method that improves given coarse correspondences to obtain dense correspondences. Following ideas from minimum description length approaches, it maximizes the compactness of the induced shape space to obtain high-quality correspondences. We make a number of improvements that are important for computer graphics applications: Our approach handles meshes of general topology and handles partial matching between input of varying topology. To this end we introduce a novel part-based generative statistical shape model. We develop a novel analysis algorithm that learns such models from training shapes of varying topology. We also provide a novel synthesis method that can generate new instances with varying part layouts and subject to generic variational constraints. In practical experiments, we obtain a substantial improvement in correspondence quality over state-of-the-art methods. As example application, we demonstrate a system that learns shape families as assemblies of deformable parts and permits real-time editing with continuous and discrete variability.","Burghard, Oliver;Berner, Alexander;Wand, Michael;Mitra, Niloy;Seidel, Hans-Peter;Klein, Reinhard",ArXiv e-prints,"[X07c3de377, X2019d3016, X26901823e, X51183cd74, X52e711acd, X56fac100e, X7e1fd6b75, X84d313e5c, X96f2e38b3, Xc1e681ca0, Xde6d14110]",X07c3de377;X2019d3016;X26901823e;X51183cd74;X52e711acd;X56fac100e;X7e1fd6b75;X84d313e5c;X96f2e38b3;Xc1e681ca0;Xde6d14110,11,Compact Part-Based Shape Spaces for Dense Correspondences,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7535,2013

153,"We derive new diffusion solutions to the monoenergetic generalized linear Boltzmann transport equation (GLBE) for the stationary collision density and scalar flux about an isotropic point source in an infinite $d$-dimensional absorbing medium with isotropic scattering. We consider both classical transport theory with exponentially-distributed free paths in arbitrary dimensions as well as a number of non-classical transport theories (non-exponential random flights) that describe a broader class of transport processes within partially-correlated random media. New rigorous asymptotic diffusion approximations are derived where possible. We also generalize Grosjean's moment-preserving approach of separating the first (or uncollided) distribution from the collided portion and approximating only the latter using diffusion. We find that for any spatial dimension and for many free-path distributions Grosjean's approach produces compact, analytic approximations that are, overall, more accurate for high absorption and for small source-detector separations than either $P_1$ diffusion or rigorous asymptotic diffusion. These diffusion-based approximations are exact in the first two even spatial moments, which we derive explicitly for various non-classical transport types. We also discuss connections between the random-flight-theory derivation of the Green's function and the discrete spectrum of the transport operator and report some new observations regarding the discrete eigenvalues of the transport operator for general dimensions and free-path distributions.","d'Eon, Eugene",Transport Theory and Statistical Physics,"[X0c6191806, X1b708618c, X1d93a6e34, X2337e994c, X285bb461a, X2963536d0, X29c05979e, X2b9f785fe, X34c00b646, X433c710e8, X4d9df1a7e, X6883bfdca, X6c6683d1c, X778a6256e, X8513cf0ef, Xb3a2c7858, Xbcae81b2c, Xbf4dbdd9d, Xc353ddcbf, Xd07d90297, Xd3a10b898, Xde318feaf, Xebfe38863, Xfb154e15a]",X0c6191806;X1b708618c;X1d93a6e34;X2337e994c;X285bb461a;X2963536d0;X29c05979e;X2b9f785fe;X34c00b646;X433c710e8;X4d9df1a7e;X6883bfdca;X6c6683d1c;X778a6256e;X8513cf0ef;Xb3a2c7858;Xbcae81b2c;Xbf4dbdd9d;Xc353ddcbf;Xd07d90297;Xd3a10b898;Xde318feaf;Xebfe38863;Xfb154e15a,24,Rigorous Asymptotic and Moment-Preserving Diffusion Approximations for Generalized Linear Boltzmann Transport in Arbitrary Dimension,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1412,2013
154,"Animation, which is basically a form of pictorial presentation, has become the most prominent feature of technology-based learning environments. It refers to simulated motion pictures showing movement of drawn objects. Recently, educational computer animation has turned out to be one of the most elegant tools for presenting multimedia materials for learners, and its significance in helping to understand and remember information has greatly increased since the advent of powerful graphics-oriented computers. In this book chapter we introduce and discuss the history of computer animation, its well-known fundamental principles and some educational applications. It is however still debatable if truly educational computer animations help in learning, as the research on whether animation aids learners' understanding of dynamic phenomena has come up with positive, negative and neutral results. We have tried to provide as much detailed information on computer animation as we could, and we hope that this book chapter will be useful for students who study computer science, computer-assisted education or some other courses connected with contemporary education, as well as researchers who conduct their research in the field of computer animation.","Musa, Sajid;Ziatdinov, Rushan;Griffiths, Carol",ArXiv e-prints,"[X000a15936, X00152ccda, X00c29529d, X04226850f, X0dbbb0972, X0f68e9594, X10981e54d, X1110a4670, X146b122ed, X19d5b6a17, X19f4e9ff2, X1a62ab857, X1fa467890, X205483de6, X22929ee17, X22b6120e4, X2337e994c, X239ec4684, X244e1619d, X251a9dc21, X2592f495f, X28a22725a, X2968ab3d7, X2b543f738, X2bd7a9711, X2e4a5ff5b, X2fda87f99, X30f01e7ba, X31561cb72, X32fcdac76, X34769eff4, X34d759302, X3794285d0, X3b5377853, X3b77907b2, X3bae553fa, X3dcd92fbc, X3f82c45ef, X403134ba9, X404fb30f0, X404ffb006, X4176f1ffc, X42a4a8979, X42fdae96a, X430e7b85d, X45a9fea21, X45b4bac3f, X46c2cde1b, X471b47649, X472dafeda, X4a26e94c6, X4a5073a16, X4af309cf2, X4d0a76e60, X4f33fd6eb, X4fe979b69, X50af78e36, X52d5d90f7, X557f56e0a, X57191f6ce, X5738ec9db, X575ca31fc, X57c293150, X57c59e11e, X57eab5877, X57f4d0051, X57f9973fc, X5846f6908, X5b11c3a75, X5beb26b0f, X5de5418c5, X60c8973d8, X63bb3e4fe, X642cfd000, X66811517d, X66ff28e1b, X6813a5107, X68aa9a44c, X699344eea, X69d4642d0, X6a08f0c9c, X6a0e02022, X6c0735947, X6c6780193, X6c9163a8e, X6cdfde205, X6e8d22738, X6f3544341, X7100777e6, X722411946, X72d411a04, X7365a3557, X740648463, X751de4139, X77f7a4f4e, X793dfd932, X7abc51233, X7c1c1ced6, X7d5859682, X7f055e133, ...]",X000a15936;X00152ccda;X00c29529d;X04226850f;X0dbbb0972;X0f68e9594;X10981e54d;X1110a4670;X146b122ed;X19d5b6a17;X19f4e9ff2;X1a62ab857;X1fa467890;X205483de6;X22929ee17;X22b6120e4;X2337e994c;X239ec4684;X244e1619d;X251a9dc21;X2592f495f;X28a22725a;X2968ab3d7;X2b543f738;X2bd7a9711;X2e4a5ff5b;X2fda87f99;X30f01e7ba;X31561cb72;X32fcdac76;X34769eff4;X34d759302;X3794285d0;X3b5377853;X3b77907b2;X3bae553fa;X3dcd92fbc;X3f82c45ef;X403134ba9;X404fb30f0;X404ffb006;X4176f1ffc;X42a4a8979;X42fdae96a;X430e7b85d;X45a9fea21;X45b4bac3f;X46c2cde1b;X471b47649;X472dafeda;X4a26e94c6;X4a5073a16;X4af309cf2;X4d0a76e60;X4f33fd6eb;X4fe979b69;X50af78e36;X52d5d90f7;X557f56e0a;X57191f6ce;X5738ec9db;X575ca31fc;X57c293150;X57c59e11e;X57eab5877;X57f4d0051;X57f9973fc;X5846f6908;X5b11c3a75;X5beb26b0f;X5de5418c5;X60c8973d8;X63bb3e4fe;X642cfd000;X66811517d;X66ff28e1b;X6813a5107;X68aa9a44c;X699344eea;X69d4642d0;X6a08f0c9c;X6a0e02022;X6c0735947;X6c6780193;X6c9163a8e;X6cdfde205;X6e8d22738;X6f3544341;X7100777e6;X722411946;X72d411a04;X7365a3557;X740648463;X751de4139;X77f7a4f4e;X793dfd932;X7abc51233;X7c1c1ced6;X7d5859682;X7f055e133;X818b17e2d;X81bf8fca2;X81d213ad2;X8735fde0a;X8786ccd8d;X8864dcb51;X88ab92f48;X89fad08a8;X8ae9aa57c;X8b42a6f57;X8be322677;X8c6a62509;X8d75a3393;X8eb5a80c2;X903f4f664;X923ea14ff;X92c739f44;X933ca350c;X954ab5956;X968b7d6bc;X979c0f8d7;X9890c1781;X98a35e194;X992564fcb;X9cceece62;X9f139f660;X9f20e3904;X9f948d33e;Xa05fe7f3e;Xa0d2b11a5;Xa1b1dd02c;Xa3ab1a559;Xa3ee73495;Xa54c398e2;Xa5bb57035;Xa5cfd0a37;Xa5e00ac1b;Xa636c7c96;Xa69ee2152;Xa78d1e126;Xa7b16d665;Xa7deda243;Xab5ac3292;Xabc9b491a;Xacb8ee0c2;Xae99130cb;Xaf0c4c2a1;Xafe6736b9;Xb035feabb;Xb28d16a1f;Xb3a15bba0;Xb3c30b61d;Xb410d346b;Xb460d3745;Xb48f43985;Xb5d20fda4;Xb8ac8bcdc;Xb8bc27178;Xb9759f108;Xba4934778;Xbcabadf19;Xbd2ad8b27;Xc28bd7ddd;Xc462b7ca3;Xc54a1c219;Xc5829f14e;Xc5f79d80d;Xc7098c46f;Xc803d7206;Xc93b3f774;Xc9e6a69cf;Xc9f255ab8;Xd1b750bf8;Xd2f137a44;Xd325fa2f9;Xd487405b6;Xd8d641fd7;Xda52e091b;Xda826059a;Xdd63e8d01;Xdf2a67536;Xdff024b2d;Xe086c3528;Xe151a3ddc;Xe20ec1b64;Xe29b68d05;Xe3135dabf;Xe44fc2e5b;Xe50b045ab;Xe697b3930;Xedc4ea732;Xf17b7ea33;Xf62b6aeb6;Xf7bcef41c;Xf7e29a1d3;Xf8451dd70;Xf95433bc5;Xff154b68e,198,Introduction to computer animation and its possible educational applications,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1824,2013
155,"We develop multiple view visualization of higher dimensional data. Our work was chiefly motivated by the need to extract insight from four dimensional Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) data. We develop visualization where multiple views, generally views of 3D projections or slices of a higher dimensional data, are tightly coupled not only by their specific order but also by a view synchronizing interaction style, and an internally defined interaction language. The tight coupling of the different views allows a fast and well-coordinated exploration of the data. In particular, the visualization allowed us to easily make consistency checks of the 4D QCD data and to infer the correctness of particle properties calculations.

156,"Estimating the body shape and posture of a dressed human subject in motion represented as a sequence of (possibly incomplete) 3D meshes is important for virtual change rooms and security. To solve this problem, statistical shape spaces encoding human body shape and posture variations are commonly used to constrain the search space for the shape estimate. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses a posture-invariant shape space to model body shape variation combined with a skeleton-based deformation to model posture variation. Our method can estimate the body shape and posture of both static scans and motion sequences of dressed human body scans. In case of motion sequences, our method takes advantage of motion cues to solve for a single body shape estimate along with a sequence of posture estimates. We apply our approach to both static scans and motion sequences and demonstrate that using our method, higher fitting accuracy is achieved than when using a variant of the popular SCAPE model as statistical model.","Wuhrer, Stefanie;Pishchulin, Leonid;Brunton, Alan;Shu, Chang;Lang, Jochen",ArXiv e-prints,"[X005001f4e, X00fa7a190, X02eece0d8, X033e62921, X085e7f2f0, X0abfec4ab, X0daabcf26, X13a5d66bf, X15043d35b, X18cc1dda5, X1bea0d378, X1f9208e59, X204920308, X234487663, X249f7683e, X26c9b03ea, X272842d09, X2a9dcf09d, X2af173476, X2bd414e0b, X2ccd26e36, X2cde7aebd, X2e18e09b1, X3092a6cea, X30cda8a1b, X3630db0e5, X371bafd3f, X3a01366b1, X3b5fcaa6c, X3d5f09d03, X3f148e508, X3f82c45ef, X42345df31, X424cfde17, X44ad6f4a2, X46a29705e, X4709aa7a6, X471fc699a, X4ba254738, X4cc53d4ef, X4ce718d76, X4d0c26063, X4e59d897e, X54869ed3e, X54b2a5f9a, X56a27eba6, X56d07593c, X573598f19, X60d4ac831, X61e0ab939, X62753567c, X6588090ac, X68c54c254, X6920c4055, X6ab8d94e2, X6c9f3f65c, X71c8e73cc, X72b650266, X73c3a6197, X76fd8a24b, X781333c1e, X794877e1d, X7a2ee39fc, X7b15a4035, X7f4011c2c, X7fb2f0c48, X8241b390f, X841d13666, X87dc7f573, X8bad1d764, X8e0390444, X8e06c7c5d, X8e944bb0f, X92a54ba20, X9a68d080f, X9bd57348e, Xa0e57b0cc, Xa5463b4f7, Xa6172b390, Xa68acc6e7, Xa6ef96367, Xa7547d2d8, Xad9f120fe, Xaed5f7894, Xaf111ecba, Xaf20da050, Xb4c99add3, Xb93a23c91, Xbb9c991b9, Xbbc652342, Xbbcab93fa, Xbca6cb772, Xbd8dbf65f, Xbece0e063, Xc1054d9f6, Xc284d5e59, Xc85c8a38b, Xc884f3376, Xca679116d, Xcb3d9a308, ...]",X005001f4e;X00fa7a190;X02eece0d8;X033e62921;X085e7f2f0;X0abfec4ab;X0daabcf26;X13a5d66bf;X15043d35b;X18cc1dda5;X1bea0d378;X1f9208e59;X204920308;X234487663;X249f7683e;X26c9b03ea;X272842d09;X2a9dcf09d;X2af173476;X2bd414e0b;X2ccd26e36;X2cde7aebd;X2e18e09b1;X3092a6cea;X30cda8a1b;X3630db0e5;X371bafd3f;X3a01366b1;X3b5fcaa6c;X3d5f09d03;X3f148e508;X3f82c45ef;X42345df31;X424cfde17;X44ad6f4a2;X46a29705e;X4709aa7a6;X471fc699a;X4ba254738;X4cc53d4ef;X4ce718d76;X4d0c26063;X4e59d897e;X54869ed3e;X54b2a5f9a;X56a27eba6;X56d07593c;X573598f19;X60d4ac831;X61e0ab939;X62753567c;X6588090ac;X68c54c254;X6920c4055;X6ab8d94e2;X6c9f3f65c;X71c8e73cc;X72b650266;X73c3a6197;X76fd8a24b;X781333c1e;X794877e1d;X7a2ee39fc;X7b15a4035;X7f4011c2c;X7fb2f0c48;X8241b390f;X841d13666;X87dc7f573;X8bad1d764;X8e0390444;X8e06c7c5d;X8e944bb0f;X92a54ba20;X9a68d080f;X9bd57348e;Xa0e57b0cc;Xa5463b4f7;Xa6172b390;Xa68acc6e7;Xa6ef96367;Xa7547d2d8;Xad9f120fe;Xaed5f7894;Xaf111ecba;Xaf20da050;Xb4c99add3;Xb93a23c91;Xbb9c991b9;Xbbc652342;Xbbcab93fa;Xbca6cb772;Xbd8dbf65f;Xbece0e063;Xc1054d9f6;Xc284d5e59;Xc85c8a38b;Xc884f3376;Xca679116d;Xcb3d9a308;Xcb487b4f0;Xceb69c0f0;Xd09b8f141;Xd1bc08400;Xd3892c60d;Xd82850b35;Xd87487a5b;Xdcee7162c;Xe09905de8;Xe66eccf49;Xe676c2b33;Xe6f645a62;Xe77769cba;Xea7448427;Xee1757997;Xee3aca169;Xee5f4175e;Xf0991d2e3;Xf3d4a9195;Xf7eec358b;Xfa53f7843;Xfb1e0f0f8;Xfc3b486bc;Xfe8f44637,124,Estimation of Human Body Shape and Posture Under Clothing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4967,2013
157,"Physical modeling method, represented by simulation and visualization of the principles in physics, is introduced in the shape extraction of the active contours. The objectives of adopting this concept are to address the several major difficulties in the application of Active Contours. Primarily, a technique is developed to realize the topological changes of Parametric Active Contours (Snakes). The key strategy is to imitate the process of a balloon expanding and filling in a closed space with several objects. After removing the touched balloon surfaces, the objects can be identified by surrounded remaining balloon surfaces. A burned region swept by Snakes is utilized to trace the contour and to give a criterion for stopping the movement of Snake curve. When the Snakes terminates evolution totally, through ignoring this criterion, it can form a connected area by evolving the Snakes again and continuing the region burning. The contours extracted from the boundaries of the burned area can represent the child snake of each object respectively. Secondly, a novel scheme is designed to solve the problems of leakage of the contour from the large gaps, and the segmentation error in Geometric Active Contours (GAC). It divides the segmentation procedure into two processing stages. By simulating the wave propagating in the isotropic substance at the final stage, it can significantly enhance the effect of image force in GAC based on Level Set and give the satisfied solutions to the two problems. Thirdly, to support the physical models for active contours above, we introduce a general image force field created on a template plane over the image plane. This force is more adaptable to noisy images with complicated geometric shapes.","Lu, Hongyu;Bao, Shanglian",ArXiv e-prints,"[X127a4228d, X12fd150c9, X262d5d75f, X46d62d29a, X9d7cdba9f, X9ddcd6893, Xb8b272120, Xbce35db1e, Xd23b864ca]",X127a4228d;X12fd150c9;X262d5d75f;X46d62d29a;X9d7cdba9f;X9ddcd6893;Xb8b272120;Xbce35db1e;Xd23b864ca,9,Physical Modeling Techniques in Active Contours for Image Segmentation,http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4036,2009
158,"A topologically-informed method is presented for seeding of hyperstreamlines for visualization of alignment tensor fields. The method is inspired by and applied to visualization of nematic liquid crystal (LC) reorientation dynamics simulations. The method distributes hyperstreamlines along domain boundaries and edges of a nearest-neighbor graph whose vertices are degenerate regions of the alignment tensor field, which correspond to orientational defects in a nematic LC domain. This is accomplished without iteration while conforming to a user-specified spacing between hyperstreamlines and avoids possible failure modes associated with hyperstreamline integration in the vicinity of degeneracies of alignment (orientational defects). It is shown that the presented seeding method enables automated hyperstreamline-based visualization of a broad range of alignment tensor fields which enhances the ability of researchers to interpret these fields and provides an alternative to using glyph-based techniques.","Fu, Fred;Mohieddin Abukhdeir, Nasser",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0214de471, X131921885, X24c156427, X2bf6fce8e, X4042d2287, X8983b80f8, Xac79325fb, Xb6f261f7a]",X0214de471;X131921885;X24c156427;X2bf6fce8e;X4042d2287;X8983b80f8;Xac79325fb;Xb6f261f7a,8,A Topologically-informed Hyperstreamline Seeding Method for Alignment Tensor Fields,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7034,2013

160,"This paper discusses the deployment of existing render farm manager in a typical compute cluster environment such as a university. Usually, both a render farm and a compute cluster use different queue managers and assume total control over the physical resources. But, taking out the physical resources from an existing compute cluster in a university-like environment whose primary use of the cluster is to run numerical simulations may not be possible. It can potentially reduce the overall resource utilization in a situation where compute tasks are more than rendering tasks. Moreover, it can increase the system administration cost. In this paper, a framework has been proposed that creates a dynamic distributed rendering environment on top of the compute clusters using existing render farm managers without requiring the physical separation of the resources.","Sheharyar, Ali;Bouhali, Othmane",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01820282d, X058b26c90, X0b5c9ab9f, X1125b33dc, X1bcb525e5, X1cf6bd075, X1d087d708, X1d27e6f97, X1d3d2a0f8, X1d77863a2, X1db6109fd, X1ffbfdaa1, X2236c62b9, X269f883b8, X26d62f965, X286100bcd, X286d87757, X2d1214ee2, X2ff5ab9ce, X31429edfa, X334f56abb, X3df0c0279, X3e18d1a8e, X40111e75d, X4123546ba, X41f5c19b6, X43498a302, X44a755105, X55f53f44e, X57f2873c6, X5b0337f20, X5ce045d4c, X61a2006f6, X61b649b58, X7ee0f499f, X80cab641a, X8335da1a1, X87b1485d5, X8a5095aae, X8aa895047, X8d9699691, X90486002a, X954efcbe9, X97213f4d7, X9890900c1, Xa0ff83886, Xa2b76bc9b, Xafe7546b9, Xb54970dc7, Xb65036c66, Xbb164f91d, Xbbd03da22, Xbecdcf7e8, Xc06a4b5c8, Xc3ce0b475, Xc6090879c, Xc7c5c6d5b, Xc8d265c88, Xc9d7e35eb, Xcbc300eae, Xd46daccfb, Xd657a5fec, Xd8dec68b2, Xdcf326a6f, Xe6ac5ddd1, Xe7494b36c, Xe9a322ae1, Xebd53e27b, Xf0ef546dd, Xf447e0b78, Xf5213e265, Xf56e36f87, Xf91b74bf2, Xfaaa3f874, Xfd2679145]",X01820282d;X058b26c90;X0b5c9ab9f;X1125b33dc;X1bcb525e5;X1cf6bd075;X1d087d708;X1d27e6f97;X1d3d2a0f8;X1d77863a2;X1db6109fd;X1ffbfdaa1;X2236c62b9;X269f883b8;X26d62f965;X286100bcd;X286d87757;X2d1214ee2;X2ff5ab9ce;X31429edfa;X334f56abb;X3df0c0279;X3e18d1a8e;X40111e75d;X4123546ba;X41f5c19b6;X43498a302;X44a755105;X55f53f44e;X57f2873c6;X5b0337f20;X5ce045d4c;X61a2006f6;X61b649b58;X7ee0f499f;X80cab641a;X8335da1a1;X87b1485d5;X8a5095aae;X8aa895047;X8d9699691;X90486002a;X954efcbe9;X97213f4d7;X9890900c1;Xa0ff83886;Xa2b76bc9b;Xafe7546b9;Xb54970dc7;Xb65036c66;Xbb164f91d;Xbbd03da22;Xbecdcf7e8;Xc06a4b5c8;Xc3ce0b475;Xc6090879c;Xc7c5c6d5b;Xc8d265c88;Xc9d7e35eb;Xcbc300eae;Xd46daccfb;Xd657a5fec;Xd8dec68b2;Xdcf326a6f;Xe6ac5ddd1;Xe7494b36c;Xe9a322ae1;Xebd53e27b;Xf0ef546dd;Xf447e0b78;Xf5213e265;Xf56e36f87;Xf91b74bf2;Xfaaa3f874;Xfd2679145,75,A Framework for Creating a Distributed Rendering Environment on the Compute Clusters,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0608,2014

We obtain a V-matrix with respect to the original mesh, whose elements are vertices of the mesh, which intrinsically preserves the vertex-set and the connectivity of the original mesh in the sense of allowing round-off errors. We generate a CGIM array by using the Cartesian coordinates of corresponding vertices of the V-matrix. To reconstruct a mesh, we obtain a vertex-set and an edge-set by collecting all the elements with different pixels, and all different pairwise adjacent elements from the CGIM array respectively. Compared with traditional geometry images, CGIMs achieve minimum reconstruction errors with an efficient parametrization-free algorithm via elementary permutation techniques.

163,"We present a statistical model for $3$D human faces in varying expression, which decomposes the surface of the face using a wavelet transform, and learns many localized, decorrelated multilinear models on the resulting coefficients. Using this model we are able to reconstruct faces from noisy and occluded $3$D face scans, and facial motion sequences. Accurate reconstruction of face shape is important for applications such as tele-presence and gaming. The localized and multi-scale nature of our model allows for recovery of fine-scale detail while retaining robustness to severe noise and occlusion, and is computationally efficient and scalable. We validate these properties experimentally on challenging data in the form of static scans and motion sequences. We show that in comparison to a global multilinear model, our model better preserves fine detail and is computationally faster, while in comparison to a localized PCA model, our model better handles variation in expression, is faster, and allows us to fix identity parameters for a given subject.","Brunton, Alan;Bolkart, Timo;Wuhrer, Stefanie",ArXiv e-prints,"[553503a268, X00fa7a190, X09ed98c25, X0a495dc69, X10cc93908, X11d124b7b, X19d4b0287, X298df2b6e, X371bafd3f, X3f2bf46bc, X49acf06b4, X5e1192257, X6961a4a80, X6bfc80c02, X7120a78fe, X71c8e73cc, X73f4a0f7e, X874995003, X88e107dd5, X8b36f9734, X94b230121, X997b1228c, X9f7130c15, Xa08b8eefd, Xb6ba17f4b, Xc35e681f2, Xc59a09b7f, Xc9c31cd52, Xd4528af5d, Xdf2ba9c7f, Xe676c2b33, Xe77769cba, Xea06f9674, Xed6052fa4, Xf2492f561, Xf697c1508, Xf7236790d, Xfa53f7843, Xfc4deeeeb]",553503a268;X00fa7a190;X09ed98c25;X0a495dc69;X10cc93908;X11d124b7b;X19d4b0287;X298df2b6e;X371bafd3f;X3f2bf46bc;X49acf06b4;X5e1192257;X6961a4a80;X6bfc80c02;X7120a78fe;X71c8e73cc;X73f4a0f7e;X874995003;X88e107dd5;X8b36f9734;X94b230121;X997b1228c;X9f7130c15;Xa08b8eefd;Xb6ba17f4b;Xc35e681f2;Xc59a09b7f;Xc9c31cd52;Xd4528af5d;Xdf2ba9c7f;Xe676c2b33;Xe77769cba;Xea06f9674;Xed6052fa4;Xf2492f561;Xf697c1508;Xf7236790d;Xfa53f7843;Xfc4deeeeb,39,Multilinear Wavelets: A Statistical Shape Space for Human Faces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2818,2014

The consequences of this approach is that most implementations fail when tested for challenging degenerate and nearly degenerate regions. We present a correct integer-only procedure that works for all connected digital pictures. It finds all possible interior points, which are then displayed and stored in a locating matrix. Namely, we present a filling and locating procedure that can be used in computer graphics and image processing applications.","Elias Fabris, Antonio;Ramos Batista, Valério",ArXiv e-prints,"[X19c551d13, X518b80d01, X58db352a4, X6191e6efe, Xec0b2406f, Xfbdc7cd34]",X19c551d13;X518b80d01;X58db352a4;X6191e6efe;Xec0b2406f;Xfbdc7cd34,6,A programme to determine the exact interior of any connected digital picture,http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3385,2014

166,"Blocking and shadowing is one of the key effects in designing and evaluating a thermal central receiver solar tower plant. Therefore it is convenient to develop efficient algorithms to compute the area of an heliostat blocked or shadowed by the rest of the field. In this paper we explore the possibility of using very efficient clipping algorithms developed for the video game and imaging industry to compute the blocking and shadowing efficiency of a solar thermal plant layout. We propose an algorithm valid for arbitrary position, orientation and size of the heliostats. This algorithm turns out to be very accurate, free of assumptions and fast. We show the feasibility of the use of this algorithm to the optimization of a solar plant by studying a couple of examples in detail.","Ramos, A.;Ramos, F.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0a78770e6, X10080db27, X1717a4654, X201f7b3d9, X2484ebc57, X2aadcc7e3, X2f5396c61, X32ccd928f, X36af9039b, X384c80ee5, X3d1b000d4, X62004e849, X69dd8ef31, X6df013733, X719f04fad, X72f001755, X734f72ff0, X7ed751954, X876c8ba2d, X8ab636564, X8c24e1fbf, X9037e025a, X9707222d0, X9ba6b415d, X9fc573562, Xa8f771300, Xc4e06e8f2, Xd049b065e, Xeed857dc8]",X0a78770e6;X10080db27;X1717a4654;X201f7b3d9;X2484ebc57;X2aadcc7e3;X2f5396c61;X32ccd928f;X36af9039b;X384c80ee5;X3d1b000d4;X62004e849;X69dd8ef31;X6df013733;X719f04fad;X72f001755;X734f72ff0;X7ed751954;X876c8ba2d;X8ab636564;X8c24e1fbf;X9037e025a;X9707222d0;X9ba6b415d;X9fc573562;Xa8f771300;Xc4e06e8f2;Xd049b065e;Xeed857dc8,29,Heliostat blocking and shadowing efficiency in the video-game era,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1690,2014
167,"We describe a technique for bundled curve representations in parallel-coordinates plots and present a controlled user study evaluating their effectiveness. Replacing the traditional C^0 polygonal lines by C^1 continuous piecewise Bezier curves makes it easier to visually trace data points through each coordinate axis. The resulting Bezier curves can then be bundled to visualize data with given cluster structures. Curve bundles are efficient to compute, provide visual separation between data clusters, reduce visual clutter, and present a clearer overview of the dataset. A controlled user study with 14 participants confirmed the effectiveness of curve bundling for parallel-coordinates visualization: 1) compared to polygonal lines, it is equally capable of revealing correlations between neighboring data attributes; 2) its geometric cues can be effective in displaying cluster information. For some datasets curve bundling allows the color perceptual channel to be applied to other data attributes, while for complex cluster patterns, bundling and color can represent clustering far more clearly than either alone.","Heinrich, Julian;Luo, Yuan;Kirkpatrick, Arthur E.;Zhang, Hao;Weiskopf, Daniel",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01ea8c9f4, X095be3e08, X0b504e5da, X14c432177, X16d459484, X17a67d812, X1b9e13f70, X1e912af2d, X230c51865, X2a413cade, X2b999438b, X2ee71e0ac, X314619641, X35cee9086, X38b17c691, X3f8e319c4, X4688e4a5d, X4d75da1e8, X500c9a83e, X6036e343f, X61b997d9e, X625dc43dc, X6c00b29bd, X6f987c72e, X79128f42f, X79db2f4b0, X7d3b97f7e, X83b74e02f, X85d9fb1f3, Xa540049ad, Xa80b93e5f, Xab43f0d60, Xadf0a9220, Xb12a83524, Xb314bd132, Xb3b61af0f, Xb84e3eb16, Xbdc77d85d, Xbe635a653, Xc77563006, Xcc7701e02, Xd50869bf4, Xd673c43cd, Xd80c1b1e7, Xde4a9b3a0, Xdf0ef438a, Xe1803cc13, Xeca2f29df, Xf0044735a, Xf65c783ce, Xfa7fbbb14, Xffb783f1c]",X01ea8c9f4;X095be3e08;X0b504e5da;X14c432177;X16d459484;X17a67d812;X1b9e13f70;X1e912af2d;X230c51865;X2a413cade;X2b999438b;X2ee71e0ac;X314619641;X35cee9086;X38b17c691;X3f8e319c4;X4688e4a5d;X4d75da1e8;X500c9a83e;X6036e343f;X61b997d9e;X625dc43dc;X6c00b29bd;X6f987c72e;X79128f42f;X79db2f4b0;X7d3b97f7e;X83b74e02f;X85d9fb1f3;Xa540049ad;Xa80b93e5f;Xab43f0d60;Xadf0a9220;Xb12a83524;Xb314bd132;Xb3b61af0f;Xb84e3eb16;Xbdc77d85d;Xbe635a653;Xc77563006;Xcc7701e02;Xd50869bf4;Xd673c43cd;Xd80c1b1e7;Xde4a9b3a0;Xdf0ef438a;Xe1803cc13;Xeca2f29df;Xf0044735a;Xf65c783ce;Xfa7fbbb14;Xffb783f1c,52,Evaluation of a Bundling Technique for Parallel Coordinates,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6073,2011
168,"In this paper a new watermarking scheme is presented based on log-average luminance. A colored-image is divided into blocks after converting the RGB colored image to YCbCr color space. A monochrome image of 1024 bytes is used as the watermark. To embed the watermark, 16 blocks of size 8X8 are selected and used to embed the watermark image into the original image. The selected blocks are chosen spirally (beginning form the center of the image) among the blocks that have log-average luminance higher than or equal the log-average luminance of the entire image. Each byte of the monochrome watermark is added by updating a luminance value of a pixel of the image. If the byte of the watermark image represented white color (255) a value 〈alpha〉 is added to the image pixel luminance value, if it is black (0) the 〈alpha〉 is subtracted from the luminance value. To extract the watermark, the selected blocks are chosen as the above, if the difference between the luminance value of the watermarked image pixel and the original image pixel is greater than 0, the watermark pixel is supposed to be white, otherwise it supposed to be black. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is efficient against changing the watermarked image to grayscale, image cropping, and JPEG compression.","Hussein, Jamal A.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0409a66f6, X054c8cc17, X08a045e2d, X0aa6da341, X0b1caee63, X0c9001319, X1b950adf0, X1d57059df, X1ee5d839c, X223677474, X289be7656, X29cf170d0, X2ce11b6a6, X30da3b4ae, X3353c1a7d, X3983f3009, X3e18b5d33, X3f0950e49, X419527bb0, X43b7a0d12, X4710d27b8, X4a789acb4, X4c4f3902b, X4d92a0876, X4ebacbe3a, X4fa07d87a, X507ff7252, X5107a9a92, X5238af44d, X53578f38f, X565ac7c28, X65252fcf3, X695374612, X6a28cd31d, X6a780fe61, X6ad5dea2f, X6af32b34f, X7034fddeb, X726ce85f0, X72f5ab79f, X7c7ed3827, X7d4f4e795, X817343eb3, X842f67ed4, X86ac0626c, X8709f1620, X8ddc871e4, X97320bdd5, X9930c2173, X9bd47374d, X9d803b638, X9e58b1c1d, X9f4ea97e4, Xac9c8dd4f, Xb73cf46e4, Xb75b78845, Xbada33e9b, Xbcf26fc75, Xc0e043fa5, Xc3b541121, Xc4c1d7926, Xca49be8ad, Xcef55d0df, Xd28d2338f, Xd54395797, Xd9027482a, Xd97dba809, Xdcb0735a3, Xe0296eee8, Xe11fa1858, Xe16731580, Xe19ad6384, Xe59f55750, Xe9691d241, Xeb1c2ec6c, Xecb8c5084, Xed6dd8e0a, Xede55f02f, Xf5a7c74c3, Xf6026ff2e, Xf634cfcad, Xf81449446, Xf9201a066, Xfa8de635e, Xfaf41cc69, Xfd03f8d96, Xfdf4c498b]",X0409a66f6;X054c8cc17;X08a045e2d;X0aa6da341;X0b1caee63;X0c9001319;X1b950adf0;X1d57059df;X1ee5d839c;X223677474;X289be7656;X29cf170d0;X2ce11b6a6;X30da3b4ae;X3353c1a7d;X3983f3009;X3e18b5d33;X3f0950e49;X419527bb0;X43b7a0d12;X4710d27b8;X4a789acb4;X4c4f3902b;X4d92a0876;X4ebacbe3a;X4fa07d87a;X507ff7252;X5107a9a92;X5238af44d;X53578f38f;X565ac7c28;X65252fcf3;X695374612;X6a28cd31d;X6a780fe61;X6ad5dea2f;X6af32b34f;X7034fddeb;X726ce85f0;X72f5ab79f;X7c7ed3827;X7d4f4e795;X817343eb3;X842f67ed4;X86ac0626c;X8709f1620;X8ddc871e4;X97320bdd5;X9930c2173;X9bd47374d;X9d803b638;X9e58b1c1d;X9f4ea97e4;Xac9c8dd4f;Xb73cf46e4;Xb75b78845;Xbada33e9b;Xbcf26fc75;Xc0e043fa5;Xc3b541121;Xc4c1d7926;Xca49be8ad;Xcef55d0df;Xd28d2338f;Xd54395797;Xd9027482a;Xd97dba809;Xdcb0735a3;Xe0296eee8;Xe11fa1858;Xe16731580;Xe19ad6384;Xe59f55750;Xe9691d241;Xeb1c2ec6c;Xecb8c5084;Xed6dd8e0a;Xede55f02f;Xf5a7c74c3;Xf6026ff2e;Xf634cfcad;Xf81449446;Xf9201a066;Xfa8de635e;Xfaf41cc69;Xfd03f8d96;Xfdf4c498b,87,Spatial Domain Watermarking Scheme for Colored Images Based on Log-average Luminance,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3496,2010

170,"This paper presents a hybrid algorithm that combines features form both Sqrt(3) and Loop Subdivision schemes. The algorithm aims at preserving sharp features and trim regions, during the surfaces subdivision, using a set of rules. The implementation is nontrivial due to the computational, topological, and smoothness constraints, which should be satisfied by the underlying surface. The fundamental innovation, in this research work, is the ability to preserve sharp features anywhere on a surface. In addition, the resulting representation remains within the multiresolution subdivision framework. Preserving the original representation has a core advantage that all the applicable operations to the multiresolution subdivision surfaces can subsequently be applied to the edited model. Experimental results, including surfaces coarsening and smoothing, were performed using the proposed algorithm for validation purposes, and the results revealed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other recent state of the art algorithms.","Abd El-Latif, Yasser M.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X1028e5d01, X10a71e5f0, X22d18ecfb, X2b543f738, X2eba43c28, X4425bcde7, X5f5e8030f, X703c56a5b, X86c487c6e, X928daeea3, Xa76871a1e, Xae17ef378, Xd1cd0d03a, Xe15204bc8, Xe16b09a1a, Xfd53879fc]",X1028e5d01;X10a71e5f0;X22d18ecfb;X2b543f738;X2eba43c28;X4425bcde7;X5f5e8030f;X703c56a5b;X86c487c6e;X928daeea3;Xa76871a1e;Xae17ef378;Xd1cd0d03a;Xe15204bc8;Xe16b09a1a;Xfd53879fc,16,Surfaces Representation with Sharp Features Using Sqrt(3) and Loop Subdivision Schemes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2190,2014
171,"The paper addresses the following problem: given a set of man-made shapes, e.g., chairs, can we quickly rank and explore the set of shapes with respect to a given avatar pose? Answering this question requires identifying which shapes are more suitable for the defined avatar and pose; and moreover, to provide fast preview of how to alter the input geometry to better fit the deformed shapes to the given avatar pose? The problem naturally links physical proportions of human body and its interaction with object shapes in an attempt to connect ergonomics with shape geometry. We designed an interaction system that allows users to explore shape collections using the deformation of human characters while at the same time providing interactive previews of how to alter the shapes to better fit the user-specified character. We achieve this by first mapping ergonomics guidelines into a set of simultaneous multi-part constraints based on target contacts; and then, proposing a novel contact-based deformation model to realize multi-contact constraints. We evaluate our framework on various chair models and validate the results via a small user study.","Zheng, Youyi;Dorsey, Julie;Mitra, Niloy",ArXiv e-prints,"[X04dee6194, X0621a4912, X0b467d7d7, X1c6e33079, X1cc2fe4ef, X205f4b640, X21111cfad, X22a2e15f7, X2c8a6df60, X2ca1b88eb, X310fb9af9, X3129befbb, X3581fa55c, X38581633e, X414b119a4, X476f13a4b, X52e711acd, X551881d95, X58ba58e16, X5c5b93357, X60ff29e7e, X6582981a6, X65cf6d2a1, X6ef36052f, X6f9aa5b4a, X94d7c5ee1, Xa96be1ff8, Xac01a07ef, Xacee52b78, Xaff1a6b18, Xb11c3a2ca, Xbdfbc4164, Xccd91f624, Xd0341986a, Xd476617a8, Xd7b00563c, Xe7fc9a4a5, Xee45295f6, Xfc3de2963, Xfdcd1353e]",X04dee6194;X0621a4912;X0b467d7d7;X1c6e33079;X1cc2fe4ef;X205f4b640;X21111cfad;X22a2e15f7;X2c8a6df60;X2ca1b88eb;X310fb9af9;X3129befbb;X3581fa55c;X38581633e;X414b119a4;X476f13a4b;X52e711acd;X551881d95;X58ba58e16;X5c5b93357;X60ff29e7e;X6582981a6;X65cf6d2a1;X6ef36052f;X6f9aa5b4a;X94d7c5ee1;Xa96be1ff8;Xac01a07ef;Xacee52b78;Xaff1a6b18;Xb11c3a2ca;Xbdfbc4164;Xccd91f624;Xd0341986a;Xd476617a8;Xd7b00563c;Xe7fc9a4a5;Xee45295f6;Xfc3de2963;Xfdcd1353e,40,Ergonomic-driven Geometric Exploration and Reshaping,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5440,2014

Anticipated dataset for sport activity is considered as input which can be applied to any HCI application.","Shingade, Ashish;Ghotkar, Archana",ArXiv e-prints,"[X010574daa, X04d470a86, X0712b761d, X09f84e920, X0b01d7cbc, X0b8180e41, X0ede5c596, X10552308e, X10f7302e4, X11f7a6e05, X1422f5f9e, X16c5cb850, X1934fb6a3, X1a82b8aa9, X1bf3b0610, X1c48f19b5, X222f87b32, X22be2d636, X22e2859e7, X22efd8cbf, X246b70a39, X249f7683e, X28f006a2a, X298dec335, X2aab862c3, X2b3011725, X2b8c205f3, X2cb56100e, X2cc44d745, X2fc768216, X2fedcaec4, X30a13668c, X3884c8970, X3ac8a0f27, X3c4eea909, X3d5f09d03, X3f148e508, X3f8a87650, X3fd687e25, X3febcb7d5, X4131a9d98, X43c50a5b5, X440687b02, X46ef3c6cb, X473c4c01a, X49f8aa6b0, X4a4829ab5, X4c27d3922, X4cfb09565, X4f9f5be44, X540f60b79, X5577c8b26, X56d07593c, X57c02a850, X5c4ad01f1, X62cf95198, X66f04d3a8, X67dc821a1, X688ce957c, X6a88fb27e, X6e178e3a8, X704ed0535, X70ae85331, X71047a478, X728f04e8b, X746dcbc16, X7a347e4ab, X7a4db3d5f, X7b6d850b9, X7e6df0f61, X7e7990990, X813ecdd26, X8241b390f, X825b6f697, X8280d207d, X851ba7fa0, X86bd5f95b, X8735fde0a, X87fcaa965, X8a74382c3, X8aa5d805f, X8ca65a144, X8d0cb3ab3, X8d276bb7c, X8e45c151c, X8f5ff1853, X92dbb047e, X94d7c5ee1, X9582b6e91, X96bd6dd0a, X970f8e95b, X9929c6d17, X99fef77a9, Xa03bec809, Xa05ab8320, Xa11a2f76a, Xa1909a654, Xa22c1a5f0, Xa2e1b36e8, Xa4f2cb967, ...]",X010574daa;X04d470a86;X0712b761d;X09f84e920;X0b01d7cbc;X0b8180e41;X0ede5c596;X10552308e;X10f7302e4;X11f7a6e05;X1422f5f9e;X16c5cb850;X1934fb6a3;X1a82b8aa9;X1bf3b0610;X1c48f19b5;X222f87b32;X22be2d636;X22e2859e7;X22efd8cbf;X246b70a39;X249f7683e;X28f006a2a;X298dec335;X2aab862c3;X2b3011725;X2b8c205f3;X2cb56100e;X2cc44d745;X2fc768216;X2fedcaec4;X30a13668c;X3884c8970;X3ac8a0f27;X3c4eea909;X3d5f09d03;X3f148e508;X3f8a87650;X3fd687e25;X3febcb7d5;X4131a9d98;X43c50a5b5;X440687b02;X46ef3c6cb;X473c4c01a;X49f8aa6b0;X4a4829ab5;X4c27d3922;X4cfb09565;X4f9f5be44;X540f60b79;X5577c8b26;X56d07593c;X57c02a850;X5c4ad01f1;X62cf95198;X66f04d3a8;X67dc821a1;X688ce957c;X6a88fb27e;X6e178e3a8;X704ed0535;X70ae85331;X71047a478;X728f04e8b;X746dcbc16;X7a347e4ab;X7a4db3d5f;X7b6d850b9;X7e6df0f61;X7e7990990;X813ecdd26;X8241b390f;X825b6f697;X8280d207d;X851ba7fa0;X86bd5f95b;X8735fde0a;X87fcaa965;X8a74382c3;X8aa5d805f;X8ca65a144;X8d0cb3ab3;X8d276bb7c;X8e45c151c;X8f5ff1853;X92dbb047e;X94d7c5ee1;X9582b6e91;X96bd6dd0a;X970f8e95b;X9929c6d17;X99fef77a9;Xa03bec809;Xa05ab8320;Xa11a2f76a;Xa1909a654;Xa22c1a5f0;Xa2e1b36e8;Xa4f2cb967;Xa6fe9ef87;Xa71676937;Xa71a83e98;Xa76871a1e;Xaa1d49e4c;Xadc9f66f2;Xae423e88e;Xb112a5047;Xb17b3bbb5;Xb20ea5244;Xb3954de25;Xb4706054b;Xbbf739a7f;Xbc8fbf33e;Xc01375a25;Xc2750fd6d;Xc3e57bf59;Xc5b4f0a57;Xc6243bbbb;Xc778af4a8;Xc7f2b3395;Xca8c30b30;Xcb487b4f0;Xcc130fe8f;Xcf3386892;Xd088f967e;Xd0df9119e;Xd1cd0d03a;Xd3b13ed00;Xd472098ce;Xd548eec2f;Xd60984886;Xd7dc639ed;Xdc17570f6;Xdc3e655a9;Xdccddfcaf;Xdd61f8508;Xdd988a5bf;Xe0c2c4c0d;Xe4ab640e1;Xe5f33a0b0;Xe92ada80e;Xeb688b2c7;Xee477f182;Xef545e172;Xf013b1696;Xf01b2ea1f;Xf2fe839f8;Xf54b09bd3;Xfacd095ec;Xfbc67dc39;Xfbf6ff71b;Xfcc5df6ce;Xfd72af9cb;Xfe91b17db,155,Animation of 3D Human Model Using Markerless Motion Capture Applied To Sports,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2363,2014
173,"This paper introduces temporal image fusion. The proposed technique builds upon previous research in exposure fusion and expands it to deal with the limited Temporal Dynamic Range of existing sensors and camera technologies. In particular, temporal image fusion enables the rendering of long-exposure effects on full frame-rate video, as well as the generation of arbitrarily long exposures from a sequence of images of the same scene taken over time. We explore the problem of temporal under-exposure, and show how it can be addressed by selectively enhancing dynamic structure. Finally, we show that the use of temporal image fusion together with content-selective image filters can produce a range of striking visual effects on a given input sequence.","Estrada, Francisco J.",ArXiv e-prints,"[553db8cda0, X12bde62dc, X13c658b68, X15ad60f55, X2658cfec4, X2ef0fa320, X399b672d1, X49721735a, X544c81ab3, X5f9741031, X665c62094, X6e4d9d4b9, X7f91b95df, X928daeea3, X96fcd9ae8, X9f467e69e, Xac16da357, Xb1e0f5bbd, Xbe623d03d, Xc0b48f0ca, Xc95325741, Xcf541a944, Xd1cd0d03a, Xd7a217d2b, Xdc4bd0fbd, Xe8dcb7bae, Xe96c43635, Xf3f964f79, Xf847509fc]",553db8cda0;X12bde62dc;X13c658b68;X15ad60f55;X2658cfec4;X2ef0fa320;X399b672d1;X49721735a;X544c81ab3;X5f9741031;X665c62094;X6e4d9d4b9;X7f91b95df;X928daeea3;X96fcd9ae8;X9f467e69e;Xac16da357;Xb1e0f5bbd;Xbe623d03d;Xc0b48f0ca;Xc95325741;Xcf541a944;Xd1cd0d03a;Xd7a217d2b;Xdc4bd0fbd;Xe8dcb7bae;Xe96c43635;Xf3f964f79;Xf847509fc,29,Temporal Image Fusion,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0087,2014
174,The use of floating bipolar electrodes in electrowinning cells of copper constitutes a nonconventional technology that promises economic and operational impacts. This paper presents a computational tool for the simulation and analysis of such electrochemical cells. A new model is developed for floating electrodes and a method of finite difference is used to obtain the threedimensional distribution of the potential and the field of current density inside the cell. The analysis of the results is based on a technique for the interactive visualization of three-dimensional vectorial fields as lines of flow.,"Mena Labraña, César;Sánchez Schulz, Ricardo;Salazar Silva, Lautaro",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0773972ae, X0d25c7224, X10315eb99, X2fee5f760, X3352288cd, X4b48f3b08, X5a4e94741, X70f4a63cc, X7c046d907, X7c36de2f0, X7d86a8128, X8145c3eed, X85f0ef487, X8aae6d314, X9206d3054, X944e43bc9, Xb6d0beb9c, Xcca60fafb, Xd60e08e47, Xd6b5f966f, Xd77c5c6d1, Xdb13b146b, Xf0c351976, Xfd0689ad9]",X0773972ae;X0d25c7224;X10315eb99;X2fee5f760;X3352288cd;X4b48f3b08;X5a4e94741;X70f4a63cc;X7c046d907;X7c36de2f0;X7d86a8128;X8145c3eed;X85f0ef487;X8aae6d314;X9206d3054;X944e43bc9;Xb6d0beb9c;Xcca60fafb;Xd60e08e47;Xd6b5f966f;Xd77c5c6d1;Xdb13b146b;Xf0c351976;Xfd0689ad9,24,Modelacion y Visualizacion Tridimensional Interactiva de Variables Electricas en Celdas de Electro-Obtencion con Electrodos Bipolares,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3974,2010
175,"We propose a simple yet very predictive form, based on a Poisson's equation, for the functional dependence of the cost from the density of points in the Euclidean bipartite matching problem. This leads, for quadratic costs, to the analytic prediction of the large N limit of the average cost in dimension d =1,2 and of the subleading correction in higher dimension. A nontrivial scaling exponent, γ<SUB>d</SUB>=d/-2d, which differs from the monopartite's one, is found for the subleading correction. We argue that the same scaling holds true for a generic cost exponent in dimension d 〉2.","Caracciolo, S.;Lucibello, C.;Parisi, G.;Sicuro, G.",Physical Review E,"[X11a817177, X17e1d0411, X1be0cf804, X22059f4de, X3de416100, X4931b4616, X50f5ea935, X59780eeb8, X5a14df624, X71d8292e3, X783e0b91b, X8e574f08a, X9e3290a72, Xa43f3e3d5, Xb468a9284, Xb4f5caf6f, Xb77db0f23, Xc2fff1b33, Xc3436d491, Xc7dca9b9f, Xd65702a6f, Xe0f469b0c, Xfc3b4236b]",X11a817177;X17e1d0411;X1be0cf804;X22059f4de;X3de416100;X4931b4616;X50f5ea935;X59780eeb8;X5a14df624;X71d8292e3;X783e0b91b;X8e574f08a;X9e3290a72;Xa43f3e3d5;Xb468a9284;Xb4f5caf6f;Xb77db0f23;Xc2fff1b33;Xc3436d491;Xc7dca9b9f;Xd65702a6f;Xe0f469b0c;Xfc3b4236b,23,Scaling hypothesis for the Euclidean bipartite matching problem,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6993,2014
176,In this paper a new algorithm has been proposed which can fix the problem of Weiler Atherton algorithm. The problem of Weiler Atherton algorithm lies in clipping self intersecting polygon. Clipping self intersecting polygon is not considered in Weiler Atherton algorithm and hence it is also a main disadvantage of this algorithm. In our new algorithm a self intersecting polygon has been divided into non self intersecting contours and then perform the Weiler Atherton clipping algorithm on those sub polygons. For holes we have to store the edges that is not own boundary of hole contour from recently clipped polygon. Thus if both contour is hole then we have to store all the edges of the recently clipped polygon. Finally the resultant polygon has been produced by eliminating all the stored edges.,"Chakraborty, Anurag",ArXiv e-prints,"[X003bde3b6, X03ef360a9, X0774a2043, X08614c717, X092f869fd, X113d51c54, X166aa646d, X1d1a8fa0b, X1f5e0ce4e, X2027efb81, X22df1794f, X26e68604f, X311437165, X3367e3575, X368ff9305, X3791fc631, X38756a6db, X443f3e059, X4910660c3, X4c63c2d2a, X4dec2c617, X5069e0d90, X51611759e, X519a54d7b, X55ade3b0b, X597232c58, X5a8d2d0f8, X62cedc29c, X6429d8ed6, X68f45a11f, X6972f0547, X6b0b9f867, X6c663e8cf, X6db552cd9, X6f44b5341, X777ce7094, X79dbcabe9, X7bce9be2b, X86c22d165, X86d989570, X8f97157ea, X932090c82, X941f9e6c4, X98086ece1, X9909c5134, X9ac884d28, X9ad429296, Xa48c2c9fb, Xa5603fa4d, Xaf0c8c285, Xb2a7a0133, Xb42e86ac1, Xb7df8ce6b, Xb817b0f77, Xbb91bc6fc, Xbe500485f, Xc36520ee1, Xcd8a6cd14, Xd1065e304, Xd1cd0d03a, Xd24d92d48, Xd42878a9d, Xd42e11a32, Xd536a46df, Xd8b6886c6, Xdb3d9bae4, Xdce6d5178, Xdf3755f11, Xe052d6ca0, Xe28c22a3d, Xe3c508229, Xe57286cdf, Xe5b620924, Xeb331ab33, Xee464caad, Xf7b7f8e54, Xfa7bdb146, Xfb69479b7, Xfbf8513b2]",X003bde3b6;X03ef360a9;X0774a2043;X08614c717;X092f869fd;X113d51c54;X166aa646d;X1d1a8fa0b;X1f5e0ce4e;X2027efb81;X22df1794f;X26e68604f;X311437165;X3367e3575;X368ff9305;X3791fc631;X38756a6db;X443f3e059;X4910660c3;X4c63c2d2a;X4dec2c617;X5069e0d90;X51611759e;X519a54d7b;X55ade3b0b;X597232c58;X5a8d2d0f8;X62cedc29c;X6429d8ed6;X68f45a11f;X6972f0547;X6b0b9f867;X6c663e8cf;X6db552cd9;X6f44b5341;X777ce7094;X79dbcabe9;X7bce9be2b;X86c22d165;X86d989570;X8f97157ea;X932090c82;X941f9e6c4;X98086ece1;X9909c5134;X9ac884d28;X9ad429296;Xa48c2c9fb;Xa5603fa4d;Xaf0c8c285;Xb2a7a0133;Xb42e86ac1;Xb7df8ce6b;Xb817b0f77;Xbb91bc6fc;Xbe500485f;Xc36520ee1;Xcd8a6cd14;Xd1065e304;Xd1cd0d03a;Xd24d92d48;Xd42878a9d;Xd42e11a32;Xd536a46df;Xd8b6886c6;Xdb3d9bae4;Xdce6d5178;Xdf3755f11;Xe052d6ca0;Xe28c22a3d;Xe3c508229;Xe57286cdf;Xe5b620924;Xeb331ab33;Xee464caad;Xf7b7f8e54;Xfa7bdb146;Xfb69479b7;Xfbf8513b2,79,An Extension Of Weiler-Atherton Algorithm To Cope With The Self-intersecting Polygon,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0917,2014
177,"Vectorization of images is a key concern uniting computer graphics and computer vision communities. In this paper we are presenting a novel idea for efficient, customizable vectorization of raster images, based on Catmull Rom spline fitting. The algorithm maintains a good balance between photo-realism and photo abstraction, and hence is applicable to applications with artistic concerns or applications where less information loss is crucial. The resulting algorithm is fast, parallelizable and can satisfy general soft realtime requirements.

178,"Real-world images usually contain vivid contents and rich textural details, which will complicate the manipulation on them. In this paper, we design a new framework based on content-aware synthesis to enhance content-aware image retargeting. By detecting the textural regions in an image, the textural image content can be synthesized rather than simply distorted or cropped. This method enables the manipulation of textural & non-textural regions with different strategy since they have different natures. We propose to retarget the textural regions by content-aware synthesis and non-textural regions by fast multi-operators. To achieve practical retargeting applications for general images, we develop an automatic and fast texture detection method that can detect multiple disjoint textural regions. We adjust the saliency of the image according to the features of the textural regions. To validate the proposed method, comparisons with state-of-the-art image targeting techniques and a user study were conducted. Convincing visual results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Dong, Weiming;Wu, Fuzhang;Kong, Yan;Mei, Xing;Lee, Tong-Yee;Zhang, Xiaopeng",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01064bf0d, X010e889f9, X105afa81b, X2e8208283, X3786b3cc3, X3b5fcaa6c, X404524a09, X435eb04cf, X48198f1a3, X4910660c3, X4ba254738, X56c6f8454, X5c733a841, X6328749da, X65c857144, X6a68fc2cd, X73a930cd4, X7a8275c65, X7c6a616d4, X7f91b95df, X8390cb901, X87556cccf, X8c820ff70, X91f714a7b, X92d79f54d, X940a21c95, X94ee24ba8, X9868f667f, X9bf727539, Xa405bf2de, Xa527a2fd5, Xa8f8ba34c, Xa9ca825e5, Xac16da357, Xace43335a, Xb65b31a41, Xbb8cf5d54, Xc340826a3, Xd7fbcc886, Xe6a2b2df2, Xecc29c28e, Xf20fbbc83, Xf46f6e312, Xf847509fc, Xf934c2f31, Xfaf0fbb93, Xfaf272d0a, Xffe9a4dda]",X01064bf0d;X010e889f9;X105afa81b;X2e8208283;X3786b3cc3;X3b5fcaa6c;X404524a09;X435eb04cf;X48198f1a3;X4910660c3;X4ba254738;X56c6f8454;X5c733a841;X6328749da;X65c857144;X6a68fc2cd;X73a930cd4;X7a8275c65;X7c6a616d4;X7f91b95df;X8390cb901;X87556cccf;X8c820ff70;X91f714a7b;X92d79f54d;X940a21c95;X94ee24ba8;X9868f667f;X9bf727539;Xa405bf2de;Xa527a2fd5;Xa8f8ba34c;Xa9ca825e5;Xac16da357;Xace43335a;Xb65b31a41;Xbb8cf5d54;Xc340826a3;Xd7fbcc886;Xe6a2b2df2;Xecc29c28e;Xf20fbbc83;Xf46f6e312;Xf847509fc;Xf934c2f31;Xfaf0fbb93;Xfaf272d0a;Xffe9a4dda,48,Image Retargeting by Content-Aware Synthesis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6566,2014

181,"For the rendering of multiple scattering effects in participating media, methods based on the diffusion approximation are an extremely efficient alternative to Monte Carlo path tracing. However, in sufficiently transparent regions, classical diffusion approximation suffers from non-physical radiative fluxes which leads to a poor match to correct light transport. In particular, this prevents the application of classical diffusion approximation to heterogeneous media, where opaque material is embedded within transparent regions. To address this limitation, we introduce flux-limited diffusion, a technique from the astrophysics domain. This method provides a better approximation to light transport than classical diffusion approximation, particularly when applied to heterogeneous media, and hence broadens the applicability of diffusion-based techniques. We provide an algorithm for flux-limited diffusion, which is validated using the transport theory for a point light source in an infinite homogeneous medium. We further demonstrate that our implementation of flux-limited diffusion produces more accurate renderings of multiple scattering in various heterogeneous datasets than classical diffusion approximation, by comparing both methods to ground truth renderings obtained via volumetric path tracing.","Koerner, David;Portsmouth, Jamie;Sadlo, Filip;Ertl, Thomas;Eberhardt, Bernd",ArXiv e-prints,"[49232e00e1, 4d6fc06b52, 51a75d0487, 54b604530c, 54d4a8c637, 551c285d03, X04af98486, X185680012, X1b89967f0, X234489d22, X25d42f05e, X357e7e2fb, X432b29be2, X49721735a, X5518d11ff, X732317b4f, X928daeea3, X9da142b3b, X9fa335dd9, Xa14d95cd2, Xade8d3874, Xb56f627af, Xbae56833c, Xc0ddfafad, Xd62c4b37f, Xd91bd32f7, Xe43b21be0, Xe815acfbb, Xee7b01fd0, Xf0cec6e61, Xf3d4a9195]",49232e00e1;4d6fc06b52;51a75d0487;54b604530c;54d4a8c637;551c285d03;X04af98486;X185680012;X1b89967f0;X234489d22;X25d42f05e;X357e7e2fb;X432b29be2;X49721735a;X5518d11ff;X732317b4f;X928daeea3;X9da142b3b;X9fa335dd9;Xa14d95cd2;Xade8d3874;Xb56f627af;Xbae56833c;Xc0ddfafad;Xd62c4b37f;Xd91bd32f7;Xe43b21be0;Xe815acfbb;Xee7b01fd0;Xf0cec6e61;Xf3d4a9195,31,Flux-Limited Diffusion for Multiple Scattering in Participating Media,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.8105,2014

The boundary representation (simply brep) of the input solid naturally induces a brep of the swept volume. We show that it is locally similar to the input brep and this serves as the basis of the framework. All the same, it admits several intricacies: (i) geometric, in terms of parametrizations and, (ii) topological, in terms of orientations. We provide a novel analysis for their resolution. More specifically, we prove a non-trivial lifting theorem which allows to locally orient the output using the orientation of the input.

185,"Decolorization is the process to convert a color image or video to its grayscale version, and it has received great attention in recent years. An ideal decolorization algorithm should preserve the original color contrast as much as possible. Meanwhile, it should provide the final decolorized result as fast as possible. However, most of the current methods are suffering from either unsatisfied color information preservation or high computational cost, limiting their application value. In this paper, a simple but effective technique is proposed for real-time decolorization. Based on the typical rgb2gray() color conversion model, which produces a grayscale image by linearly combining R, G, and B channels, we propose a dominant color hypothesis and a corresponding distance measurement metric to evaluate the quality of grayscale conversion. The local optimum scheme provides several ""good"" candidates in a confidence interval, from which the ""best"" result can be extracted. Experimental results demonstrate that remarkable simplicity of the proposed method facilitates the process of high resolution images and videos in real-time using a common CPU.","Hu, Wei;Li, Wei;Zhang, Fan;Du, Qian",ArXiv e-prints,"[X09e033b1b, X0b95423c3, X0ee7edd95, X1f57e75e6, X201ac27e8, X263c4e13c, X2995ed4d4, X33218a7e7, X509f765f3, X7f91b95df, X80973cd86, Xac16da357, Xb55ad7610, Xe0d48a752, Xe36d286ff, Xe676c2b33, Xe8854cc01, Xf847509fc, Xfe4aaccfd]",X09e033b1b;X0b95423c3;X0ee7edd95;X1f57e75e6;X201ac27e8;X263c4e13c;X2995ed4d4;X33218a7e7;X509f765f3;X7f91b95df;X80973cd86;Xac16da357;Xb55ad7610;Xe0d48a752;Xe36d286ff;Xe676c2b33;Xe8854cc01;Xf847509fc;Xfe4aaccfd,19,Real-time Decolorization using Dominant Colors,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2728,2014
186,"This research paper addresses the problem of generating involuntary and precise animation of quadrupeds with automatic rigging system of various character types. The technique proposed through this research is based on a two tier animation control curve with base simulation being driven through dynamic mathematical model using procedural algorithm and the top layer with a custom user controlled animation provided with intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). The character rig is based on forward and inverse kinematics driven through trigonometric based motion equations. The User is provided with various manipulators and attributes to control and handle the locomotion gaits of the characters and choose between various types of simulated motions from walking, running, trotting, ambling and galloping with complete custom controls to easily extend the base simulation as per requirements.","Bhatti, Zeeshan;Shah, Asadullah;Karabasi, Mustafa;Mahesar, Waheed",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01148850b, X078251bfb, X0d65299e8, X0dc915960, X10617850f, X2383a58a4, X24bca9687, X264fe0b49, X33218a7e7, X3cbf11630, X45886f9da, X4a1c58052, X4bdebdb56, X5429dd7fc, X631296123, X66f384d3f, X7f531c86e, X8132b0f27, X84148c097, X8a9b463eb, X8c8f2d148, X928daeea3, X9489f61b9, X963e3a7ea, Xa23b9568a, Xa262b637d, Xb899a4f01, Xc778af4a8, Xc7c5c6d5b, Xca5281b2c, Xfb9f3b02e, Xfcff454b3]",X01148850b;X078251bfb;X0d65299e8;X0dc915960;X10617850f;X2383a58a4;X24bca9687;X264fe0b49;X33218a7e7;X3cbf11630;X45886f9da;X4a1c58052;X4bdebdb56;X5429dd7fc;X631296123;X66f384d3f;X7f531c86e;X8132b0f27;X84148c097;X8a9b463eb;X8c8f2d148;X928daeea3;X9489f61b9;X963e3a7ea;Xa23b9568a;Xa262b637d;Xb899a4f01;Xc778af4a8;Xc7c5c6d5b;Xca5281b2c;Xfb9f3b02e;Xfcff454b3,32,Expression driven Trignometric based Procedural Animation of Quadrupeds,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2053,2014

We introduce in this paper the dynamics of polynomials z^ n - z + c = 0 for n〉=2 and applied Jungck Ishikawa Iteration to generate new Relative Superior Mandelbrot sets and Relative Superior Julia sets. In order to solve this function by Jungck type iterative schemes, we write it in the form of Sz = Tz, where the function T, S are defined as Tz = z^ n + c and Sz = z.

188,The use of floating bipolar electrodes in electrowinning cells of copper constitutes a nonconventional technology that promises economic and operational impacts. This thesis presents a computational tool for the simulation and analysis of such electrochemical cells. A new model is developed for floating electrodes and a method of finite difference is used to obtain the threedimensional distribution of the potential and the field of current density inside the cell. The analysis of the results is based on a technique for the interactive visualization of three-dimensional vectorial fields as lines of flow.,"Mena Labraña, César",ArXiv e-prints,"[X02521c1a5, X04d731322, X054317301, X05b273e54, X0660ce48b, X0730cee8a, X088e12ecd, X091404cd5, X0adbc1b8e, X0d67f21ce, X0d6a6e34e, X10018e827, X107a57b58, X1270d4558, X127966501, X1356142d0, X164191694, X167d67f69, X173f44a1e, X1742340e1, X1750cda4e, X18a93aee5, X1947cd247, X1ad5a9603, X1b20393af, X1beb417f3, X1da191310, X1dbb70644, X1dc63ab4e, X218b0e177, X229a0606f, X232eb1de7, X23a5ea4a9, X244a5cde2, X256269528, X26fd7fc84, X288352837, X2ad623093, X2b2c98234, X2c0367009, X2c73517be, X2d1be1302, X2dd2191ea, X2fcba3ce8, X318eb24b7, X38a455a52, X39de9c416, X3a23a5f83, X3a3b7cfb9, X3afb056dc, X3f5f156ed, X3fb321c43, X42a889c1f, X42b8ac33d, X43c60fbbe, X43eba71ea, X462f6c340, X467c63f78, X46f373991, X4b15df955, X4b44801ca, X4d11effbf, X4e61edfa1, X4fb9ebccc, X5106601d3, X5251f18ae, X54299fe96, X5668f7da8, X571b0a38b, X571c5656f, X587c4f508, X59591a6aa, X5a114d973, X5aea14321, X5b2140705, X5c5a44f72, X5d7d1f7d0, X5ed9a9029, X60208f714, X625dc43dc, X626d55bab, X627fccd14, X633b9457e, X6473f7337, X64832ca51, X65734439b, X65dab3865, X6654baf66, X666d4dcbb, X67b3dd9d4, X688852049, X68f5acc5b, X6925c403e, X69a1fec7b, X69f236784, X6a98892b8, X6b12e7d54, X6d51fd135, X6eaa9c53e, X6ff2fc0a8, ...]",X02521c1a5;X04d731322;X054317301;X05b273e54;X0660ce48b;X0730cee8a;X088e12ecd;X091404cd5;X0adbc1b8e;X0d67f21ce;X0d6a6e34e;X10018e827;X107a57b58;X1270d4558;X127966501;X1356142d0;X164191694;X167d67f69;X173f44a1e;X1742340e1;X1750cda4e;X18a93aee5;X1947cd247;X1ad5a9603;X1b20393af;X1beb417f3;X1da191310;X1dbb70644;X1dc63ab4e;X218b0e177;X229a0606f;X232eb1de7;X23a5ea4a9;X244a5cde2;X256269528;X26fd7fc84;X288352837;X2ad623093;X2b2c98234;X2c0367009;X2c73517be;X2d1be1302;X2dd2191ea;X2fcba3ce8;X318eb24b7;X38a455a52;X39de9c416;X3a23a5f83;X3a3b7cfb9;X3afb056dc;X3f5f156ed;X3fb321c43;X42a889c1f;X42b8ac33d;X43c60fbbe;X43eba71ea;X462f6c340;X467c63f78;X46f373991;X4b15df955;X4b44801ca;X4d11effbf;X4e61edfa1;X4fb9ebccc;X5106601d3;X5251f18ae;X54299fe96;X5668f7da8;X571b0a38b;X571c5656f;X587c4f508;X59591a6aa;X5a114d973;X5aea14321;X5b2140705;X5c5a44f72;X5d7d1f7d0;X5ed9a9029;X60208f714;X625dc43dc;X626d55bab;X627fccd14;X633b9457e;X6473f7337;X64832ca51;X65734439b;X65dab3865;X6654baf66;X666d4dcbb;X67b3dd9d4;X688852049;X68f5acc5b;X6925c403e;X69a1fec7b;X69f236784;X6a98892b8;X6b12e7d54;X6d51fd135;X6eaa9c53e;X6ff2fc0a8;X72ff97165;X73dceaa92;X766217f71;X768398243;X78e660c63;X78ff6b0cd;X79257744d;X79bbcc70a;X79cf652e6;X7a7ac8c7a;X7a82e1d4c;X7c2906372;X7c7c23382;X7d1edd56d;X7edadbb5d;X7ee51cf02;X804413c66;X81f0adf47;X81f0be6c3;X8321368d8;X8390e50c3;X87c920b5d;X87ee33be1;X8800010ef;X88ab92f48;X8979095a7;X8a9b42596;X8b0347ce0;X8c2e2bc4e;X8d344d687;X8d54add95;X8ee082ab0;X9066f25f6;X920a6199b;X926ac669e;X92a1956dc;X956d2b44f;X960f00c19;X968b03f22;X9f0074ca2;X9f5ce5132;X9f68969a1;X9f6c07175;Xa147764ec;Xa26124713;Xa3ed6069b;Xa56a1efdb;Xa5b665b82;Xa6fed02f4;Xa825c4be4;Xa919bdfb0;Xa96f315e9;Xa994714b6;Xaa250204f;Xaacb694d6;Xabc944bd4;Xac35a277e;Xacf1f54da;Xadac77ac0;Xadd6f3195;Xaece9db5b;Xb1896643e;Xb1e414a19;Xb223eb003;Xb2e49c570;Xb31826c97;Xb44175ddd;Xb4c104d60;Xb4d12187f;Xb5a3f3831;Xb628905cb;Xb859d9f0f;Xb8865a3af;Xb8b186530;Xb9563413e;Xbaa825671;Xbb1328e92;Xbb140bf03;Xbb42b4c66;Xbbfc8804d;Xbe0f6c362;Xbe6e56082;Xbf91461f3;Xc0835d464;Xc0cf4059d;Xc1d8087fb;Xc24634d3a;Xc5cb8cd9f;Xc6ed840a9;Xc912cf710;Xc971d873c;Xc9cb2477b;Xcc812f802;Xcd2ff11dd;Xcd7eeba7d;Xceb392b3b;Xcf4f9bec9;Xd13f69a11;Xd2fee235e;Xd3f0ec34a;Xd47c27a45;Xd50ebe8da;Xd6b1cf7a9;Xd7685ae71;Xd76e2fbb7;Xd79b18b7f;Xd87694117;Xd9368394b;Xda7417216;Xdba11e7b7;Xdbfa341af;Xdc9afbbbe;Xdd27d38c2;Xddbf3bc7f;Xded9eee85;Xe02f930e2;Xe1290a4cd;Xe1bc5803c;Xe353dd49a;Xe4382b2a7;Xe50a26ab3;Xe73f127d7;Xe84d32aa9;Xe8f99754f;Xe93a5f619;Xea01033d0;Xea5d004f2;Xeacb0e8b6;Xeb4db37f4;Xecb3134f3;Xed7f3be5c;Xed851e6e1;Xedb94bc91;Xef45bb9a9;Xf1319cc83;Xf3831f890;Xf49b5e1a4;Xf6c6ebfc7;Xf72d6bd18;Xf7470dbc1;Xf76e0f4b7;Xf8047f040;Xf9c1096bd;Xfa16694b9;Xfada7adda;Xfb0befbd4;Xfb7438399;Xfe739895a;Xfed7e0567;Xff3db543f;Xff88add38,251,Aplicacion Grafica para el estudio de un Modelo de Celda Electrolitica usando Tecnicas de Visualizacion de Campos Vectoriales,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4002,2010

190,"This paper presents a survey of ocean simulation and rendering methods in computer graphics. To model and animate the ocean's surface, these methods mainly rely on two main approaches: on the one hand, those which approximate ocean dynamics with parametric, spectral or hybrid models and use empirical laws from oceanographic research. We will see that this type of methods essentially allows the simulation of ocean scenes in the deep water domain, without breaking waves. On the other hand, physically-based methods use Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE) to represent breaking waves and more generally ocean surface near the shore. We also describe ocean rendering methods in computer graphics, with a special interest in the simulation of phenomena such as foam and spray, and light's interaction with the ocean surface.","Darles, Emmanuelle;Crespin, Benoît;Ghazanfarpour, Djamchid;Gonzato, Jean-Christophe",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0048b2061, X07cf702a6, X07dca9b2f, X095ba31b5, X0aaac57f2, X161db1c5e, X19c910d71, X1bfbb744c, X1cae0fa4f, X24364b5d5, X25002ddd1, X26797c090, X27250911f, X2eff79678, X30d7dca12, X316a86b13, X32dd4b4f3, X393604e08, X3e4c69bef, X418907831, X42345df31, X4432b3351, X4693867b9, X4966cb7db, X49d6477c3, X49ec8080a, X53c105a88, X578757fc1, X58683cb6d, X58af12aaa, X5c35924cd, X5ed008c7b, X5f77c634a, X6099a8d4d, X641205ae7, X64e0e5ca1, X670539dc2, X6b20eadfb, X706d0b634, X744455f3c, X76e1ebe9f, X7956aaacc, X7bc0495d3, X7eac1fc8c, X802ee128f, X805f180d1, X821735dbc, X899f04bf1, X90390d3ab, X940e940e6, X95bccd8c2, X99693601d, Xa05b74962, Xae57084a6, Xafe27c7db, Xb2b6efbcf, Xb384b622d, Xbcefe422d, Xc2516125f, Xc27778355, Xc34a88b47, Xc500db453, Xc628f3bce, Xcc264f75e, Xcc4347f13, Xd9f841647, Xdc588fd26, Xe61ac0dab, Xe66325730, Xe78ea96fc, Xf68d425d3, Xf7b69f273, Xf989fba60]",X0048b2061;X07cf702a6;X07dca9b2f;X095ba31b5;X0aaac57f2;X161db1c5e;X19c910d71;X1bfbb744c;X1cae0fa4f;X24364b5d5;X25002ddd1;X26797c090;X27250911f;X2eff79678;X30d7dca12;X316a86b13;X32dd4b4f3;X393604e08;X3e4c69bef;X418907831;X42345df31;X4432b3351;X4693867b9;X4966cb7db;X49d6477c3;X49ec8080a;X53c105a88;X578757fc1;X58683cb6d;X58af12aaa;X5c35924cd;X5ed008c7b;X5f77c634a;X6099a8d4d;X641205ae7;X64e0e5ca1;X670539dc2;X6b20eadfb;X706d0b634;X744455f3c;X76e1ebe9f;X7956aaacc;X7bc0495d3;X7eac1fc8c;X802ee128f;X805f180d1;X821735dbc;X899f04bf1;X90390d3ab;X940e940e6;X95bccd8c2;X99693601d;Xa05b74962;Xae57084a6;Xafe27c7db;Xb2b6efbcf;Xb384b622d;Xbcefe422d;Xc2516125f;Xc27778355;Xc34a88b47;Xc500db453;Xc628f3bce;Xcc264f75e;Xcc4347f13;Xd9f841647;Xdc588fd26;Xe61ac0dab;Xe66325730;Xe78ea96fc;Xf68d425d3;Xf7b69f273;Xf989fba60,73,A Survey of Ocean Simulation and Rendering Techniques in Computer Graphics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6494,2011
191,"A recent development, called isogeometric analysis, provides a unified approach for design, analysis and optimization of functional products in industry. Traditional volume rendering methods for inspecting the results from the numerical simulations can not be applied directly to isogeometric models. We present a novel approach for interactive visualization of isogeometric analysis results, ensuring correct, i.e., pixel-accurate geometry of the volume including its bounding surfaces. The entire OpenGL pipeline is used in a multi-stage algorithm leveraging techniques from surface rendering, order-independent transparency and numerical theory of ordinary differential equations. We showcase the efficiency of our approach on different models relevant to industry, ranging from quality inspection of the parametrization of the geometry, to stress analysis in linear elasticity, to visualization of computational fluid dynamics results.","Fuchs, Franz G.;Hjelmervik, Jon M.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X02aeca0e1, X0c1c94aff, X1817c1086, X1f5458149, X2eba43c28, X33218a7e7, X3e7db01c3, X4401b1f98, X4474fe13e, X530cf2aab, X5dbb6c4ea, X6ab721d77, X6b39e5d04, X6e5ab6ef7, X928daeea3, X93cc7a325, Xaef17829d, Xb4c52456e, Xb6551b5a6, Xedc8b7a86, Xf10d54612]",X02aeca0e1;X0c1c94aff;X1817c1086;X1f5458149;X2eba43c28;X33218a7e7;X3e7db01c3;X4401b1f98;X4474fe13e;X530cf2aab;X5dbb6c4ea;X6ab721d77;X6b39e5d04;X6e5ab6ef7;X928daeea3;X93cc7a325;Xaef17829d;Xb4c52456e;Xb6551b5a6;Xedc8b7a86;Xf10d54612,21,Interactive Isogeometric Volume Visualization with Pixel-Accurate Geometry,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3363,2014
192,"Using the normalized B-bases of vector spaces of trigonometric and hyperbolic polynomials of finite order, we specify control point configurations for the exact description of higher dimensional (rational) curves and (hybrid) multivariate surfaces determined by coordinate functions that are exclusively given either by traditional trigonometric or hyperbolic polynomials in each of their variables. The usefulness and applicability of theoretical results and proposed algorithms are illustrated by many examples that also comprise the control point based exact description of several famous curves (like epi- and hypocycloids, foliums, torus knots, Bernoulli's lemniscate, hyperbolas), surfaces (such as pure trigonometric or hybrid surfaces of revolution like tori and hyperboloids, respectively) and 3-dimensional volumes. The core of the proposed modeling methods relies on basis transformation matrices with entries that can be efficiently obtained by order elevation. Providing subdivision formulae for curves described by convex combinations of these normalized B-basis functions and control points, we also ensure the possible incorporation of all proposed techniques into today's CAD systems.","Róth, Ágoston",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0036c9343, X0ca26d2c4, X2813a084a, X308b69b99, X33218a7e7, X353ba8708, X35c8b4efe, X43d739d65, X4bebadbb4, X53167407e, X56b9fe03a, X705d74f3e, X7736898f2, X78f0ebd5f, X7fc53d9c6, X817544773, Xa05439e66, Xa2d86d6e6, Xa37a80ded, Xad7c879ae, Xb6a9b7be0, Xbfa0ee613, Xc2aded94e, Xf7236790d]",X0036c9343;X0ca26d2c4;X2813a084a;X308b69b99;X33218a7e7;X353ba8708;X35c8b4efe;X43d739d65;X4bebadbb4;X53167407e;X56b9fe03a;X705d74f3e;X7736898f2;X78f0ebd5f;X7fc53d9c6;X817544773;Xa05439e66;Xa2d86d6e6;Xa37a80ded;Xad7c879ae;Xb6a9b7be0;Xbfa0ee613;Xc2aded94e;Xf7236790d,24,Control point based exact description of higher dimensional trigonometric and hyperbolic curves and multivariate surfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3767,2014
193,"We study the two-player safe game of Competitive Diffusion, a game-theoretic model for the diffusion of technologies or influence through a social network. In game theory, safe strategies are mixed strategies with a minimal expected gain against unknown strategies of the opponents. Safe strategies for competitive diffusion lead to maximum spread of influence in the presence of uncertainty about the other players. We study the safe game on two specific classes of trees, spiders and complete trees, and give tight bounds on the minimal expected gain. We then use these results to give an algorithm which suggests a safe strategy for a player on any tree. We test this algorithm on randomly generated trees, and show that it finds strategies that are close to optimal.","Janssen, Jeannette;Vautour, Celeste",ArXiv e-prints,"[X027082ba9, X122c2793f, X296a897d9, X33218a7e7, X40b16feee, X5a32fd1f5, X6e81bfafa, X75b2d78c9, Xa654ebc3f]",X027082ba9;X122c2793f;X296a897d9;X33218a7e7;X40b16feee;X5a32fd1f5;X6e81bfafa;X75b2d78c9;Xa654ebc3f,9,Finding safe strategies for competitive diffusion on trees,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5356,2014
194,"We present Piko, a framework for designing, optimizing, and retargeting implementations of graphics pipelines on multiple architectures. Piko programmers express a graphics pipeline by organizing the computation within each stage into spatial bins and specifying a scheduling preference for these bins. Our compiler, Pikoc, compiles this input into an optimized implementation targeted to a massively-parallel GPU or a multicore CPU. Piko manages work granularity in a programmable and flexible manner, allowing programmers to build load-balanced parallel pipeline implementations, to exploit spatial and producer-consumer locality in a pipeline implementation, and to explore tradeoffs between these considerations. We demonstrate that Piko can implement a wide range of pipelines, including rasterization, Reyes, ray tracing, rasterization/ray tracing hybrid, and deferred rendering. Piko allows us to implement efficient graphics pipelines with relative ease and to quickly explore design alternatives by modifying the spatial binning configurations and scheduling preferences for individual stages, all while delivering real-time performance that is within a factor six of state-of-the-art rendering systems.","Patney, Anjul;Tzeng, Stanley;Seitz, Kerry A., Jr.;Owens, John

195,"We present a generalization of the bilateral filter that can be applied to feature-preserving smoothing of signals on images, meshes, and other domains within a single unified framework. Our discretization is competitive with state-of-the-art smoothing techniques in terms of both accuracy and speed, is easy to implement, and has parameters that are straightforward to understand. Unlike previous bilateral filters developed for meshes and other irregular domains, our construction reduces exactly to the image bilateral on rectangular domains and comes with a rigorous foundation in both the smooth and discrete settings. These guarantees allow us to construct unconditionally convergent mean-shift schemes that handle a variety of extremely noisy signals. We also apply our framework to geometric edge-preserving effects like feature enhancement and show how it is related to local histogram techniques.","Solomon, Justin;Crane, Keenan;Butscher, Adrian;Wojtan, Chris",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01ae03181, X06425521d, X0968244f9, X14480c7b0, X18dabe571, X1b2409826, X1c6e33079, X242ec5d87, X257fa92e4, X299cf3488, X2a2125975, X2ae09842a, X2b2e49aa8, X2f7e970c8, X30cdf1120, X333c4beaf, X345f14ecc, X37b3b66f1, X37b7c25f2, X3eda07234, X48df8689f, X4d4fcdc68, X509af72cd, X5eb7280b9, X6d6346b24, X7000d6ed8, X724833c7a, X7c243ce33, X80b11d1c2, X8cfb1f02f, X8edd334dc, X928daeea3, X997ac7cd5, X998f6958d, X9b803b015, Xa241bf592, Xa466b8f10, Xa67097899, Xa7f298a81, Xae570db02, Xaf90c4578, Xb044d9a2c, Xb0b7bddf8, Xb744496c5, Xb9c6350fd, Xc15f8f730, Xd951d3430, Xdfde95b4a, Xe412a8ecf, Xe7d5b94a9, Xeebe1fff2, Xf0db8e9a5, Xf8c15697c, Xfb7720b04]",X01ae03181;X06425521d;X0968244f9;X14480c7b0;X18dabe571;X1b2409826;X1c6e33079;X242ec5d87;X257fa92e4;X299cf3488;X2a2125975;X2ae09842a;X2b2e49aa8;X2f7e970c8;X30cdf1120;X333c4beaf;X345f14ecc;X37b3b66f1;X37b7c25f2;X3eda07234;X48df8689f;X4d4fcdc68;X509af72cd;X5eb7280b9;X6d6346b24;X7000d6ed8;X724833c7a;X7c243ce33;X80b11d1c2;X8cfb1f02f;X8edd334dc;X928daeea3;X997ac7cd5;X998f6958d;X9b803b015;Xa241bf592;Xa466b8f10;Xa67097899;Xa7f298a81;Xae570db02;Xaf90c4578;Xb044d9a2c;Xb0b7bddf8;Xb744496c5;Xb9c6350fd;Xc15f8f730;Xd951d3430;Xdfde95b4a;Xe412a8ecf;Xe7d5b94a9;Xeebe1fff2;Xf0db8e9a5;Xf8c15697c;Xfb7720b04,54,A General Framework for Bilateral and Mean Shift Filtering,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4734,2014
196,"This paper presents a convexity analysis for the dynamic snake model based on the Potential Energy functional and the Hamiltonian formulation of the classical mechanics. First we see the snake model as a dynamical system whose singular points are the borders we seek. Next we show that a necessary condition for a singular point to be an attractor is that the energy functional is strictly convex in a neighborhood of it, that means, if the singular point is a local minimum of the potential energy. As a consequence of this analysis, a local expression relating the dynamic parameters and the rate of convergence arises. Such results link the convexity analysis of the potential energy and the dynamic snake model and point forward to the necessity of a physical quantity whose convexity analysis is related to the dynamic and which incorporate the velocity space. Such a quantity is exactly the (conservative) Hamiltonian of the system.","Giraldi, Gilson Antonio;Fernandes de Oliveira, Antonio Alberto",ArXiv e-prints,"[54f8c36d1e, X6eb2e1e7e, X7a16f6ae9, X7b304fe0c, X962f96fcb, Xa1f5f2c6b, Xf13716e2a]",54f8c36d1e;X6eb2e1e7e;X7a16f6ae9;X7b304fe0c;X962f96fcb;Xa1f5f2c6b;Xf13716e2a,7,Convexity Analysis of Snake Models Based on Hamiltonian Formulation,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0504031,2005

198,"In this note, we show that the L2 optimal solutions to most real multiple view L2 triangulation problems can be efficiently obtained by two-stage Newton-like iterative methods, while the difficulty of such problems mainly lies in how to verify the L2 optimality. Such a working two-stage bundle adjustment approach features: first, the algorithm is initialized by symmedian point triangulation, a multiple-view generalization of the mid-point method; second, a symbolic-numeric method is employed to compute derivatives accurately; third, globalizing strategy such as line search or trust region is smoothly applied to the underlying iteration which assures algorithm robustness in general cases. Numerical comparison with tfml method shows that the local minimizers obtained by the two-stage iterative bundle adjustment approach proposed here are also the L2 optimal solutions to all the calibrated data sets available online by the Oxford visual geometry group. Extensive numerical experiments indicate the bundle adjustment approach solves more than 99% the real triangulation problems optimally.

199,"In motion analysis and understanding it is important to be able to fit a suitable model or structure to the temporal series of observed data, in order to describe motion patterns in a compact way, and to discriminate between them. In an unsupervised context, i.e., no prior model of the moving object(s) is available, such a structure has to be learned from the data in a bottom-up fashion. In recent times, volumetric approaches in which the motion is captured from a number of cameras and a voxel-set representation of the body is built from the camera views, have gained ground due to attractive features such as inherent view-invariance and robustness to occlusions. Automatic, unsupervised segmentation of moving bodies along entire sequences, in a temporally-coherent and robust way, has the potential to provide a means of constructing a bottom-up model of the moving body, and track motion cues that may be later exploited for motion classification. Spectral methods such as locally linear embedding (LLE) can be useful in this context, as they preserve ""protrusions"", i.e., high-curvature regions of the 3D volume, of articulated shapes, while improving their separation in a lower dimensional space, making them in this way easier to cluster. In this paper we therefore propose a spectral approach to unsupervised and temporally-coherent body-protrusion segmentation along time sequences. Volumetric shapes are clustered in an embedding space, clusters are propagated in time to ensure coherence, and merged or split to accommodate changes in the body's topology. Experiments on both synthetic and real sequences of dense voxel-set data are shown. This supports the ability of the proposed method to cluster body-parts consistently over time in a totally unsupervised fashion, its robustness to sampling density and shape quality, and its potential for bottom-up model construction","Cuzzolin, Fabio;Mateus, Diana;Horaud, Radu",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0f2007db0, X216f2fd68, X2d29c3f2d, X370f0d2d0, X70b2c6e4a, Xa84dfb5f3, Xb8e454f98, Xbbecb7316, Xbd1adcf05, Xd30795f42, Xd979c819c]",X0f2007db0;X216f2fd68;X2d29c3f2d;X370f0d2d0;X70b2c6e4a;Xa84dfb5f3;Xb8e454f98;Xbbecb7316;Xbd1adcf05;Xd30795f42;Xd979c819c,11,Robust Temporally Coherent Laplacian Protrusion Segmentation of 3D Articulated Bodies,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6563,2014
200,"Projective geometry provides the preferred framework for most implementations of Euclidean space in graphics applications. Translations and rotations are both linear transformations in projective geometry, which helps when it comes to programming complicated geometrical operations. But there is a fundamental weakness in this approach - the Euclidean distance between points is not handled in a straightforward manner. Here we discuss a solution to this problem, based on conformal geometry. The language of geometric algebra is best suited to exploiting this geometry, as it handles the interior and exterior products in a single, unified framework. A number of applications are discussed, including a compact formula for reflecting a line off a general spherical surface.","Doran, Chris;Lasenby, Anthony;Lasenby, Joan",ArXiv e-prints,"[X1a915f36d, X1c2a78f68, X21872ce75, X32bf4ace3, X3a6ceb8f3, X5095ef3e9, X645dcee83, X66b4c9339, X686fdf836, X74e0f02f7, Xa474c9811, Xc97204385, Xcd1743cd4, Xd8572bf8b, Xe50d16201, Xe78782eb8]",X1a915f36d;X1c2a78f68;X21872ce75;X32bf4ace3;X3a6ceb8f3;X5095ef3e9;X645dcee83;X66b4c9339;X686fdf836;X74e0f02f7;Xa474c9811;Xc97204385;Xcd1743cd4;Xd8572bf8b;Xe50d16201;Xe78782eb8,16,"Conformal Geometry, Euclidean Space and Geometric Algebra",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0203026,2002
201,"We describe new approaches for distances between pairs of 2-dimensional surfaces (embedded in 3-dimensional space) that use local structures and global information contained in inter-structure geometric relationships. We present algorithms to automatically determine these distances as well as geometric correspondences. This is motivated by the aspiration of students of natural science to understand the continuity of form that unites the diversity of life. At present, scientists using physical traits to study evolutionary relationships among living and extinct animals analyze data extracted from carefully defined anatomical correspondence points (landmarks). Identifying and recording these landmarks is time consuming and can be done accurately only by trained morphologists. This renders these studies inaccessible to non-morphologists, and causes phenomics to lag behind genomics in elucidating evolutionary patterns. Unlike other algorithms presented for morphological correspondences our approach does not require any preliminary marking of special features or landmarks by the user. It also differs from other seminal work in computational geometry in that our algorithms are polynomial in nature and thus faster, making pairwise comparisons feasible for significantly larger numbers of digitized surfaces. We illustrate our approach using three datasets representing teeth and different bones of primates and humans, and show that it leads to highly accurate results.","Boyer, D.

202,"This paper extends a recently proposed robust computational framework for constructing the boundary representation (brep) of the volume swept by a given smooth solid moving along a one parameter family $h$ of rigid motions. Our extension allows the input solid to have sharp features, i.e., to be of class G0 wherein, the unit outward normal to the solid may be discontinuous. In the earlier framework, the solid to be swept was restricted to be G1, and thus this is a significant and useful extension of that work. This naturally requires a precise description of the geometry of the surface generated by the sweep of a sharp edge supported by two intersecting smooth faces. We uncover the geometry along with the related issues like parametrization, self-intersection and singularities via a novel mathematical analysis. Correct trimming of such a surface is achieved by a delicate analysis of the interplay between the cone of normals at a sharp point and its trajectory under $h$. The overall topology is explicated by a key lifting theorem which allows us to compute the adjacency relations amongst entities in the swept volume by relating them to corresponding adjacencies in the input solid. Moreover, global issues related to body-check such as orientation are efficiently resolved. Many examples from a pilot implementation illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework.","Adsul, Bharat;Machchhar, Jinesh;Sohoni, Milind",ArXiv e-prints,"[X13489a5bc, X80150ec3b, Xb6ba17f4b, Xc951e17c2]",X13489a5bc;X80150ec3b;Xb6ba17f4b;Xc951e17c2,4,Incorporating Sharp Features in the General Solid Sweep Framework,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7457,2014

206,"Search-based texture synthesis algorithms are sensitive to the order in which texture samples are generated; different synthesis orders yield different textures. Unfortunately, most polygon rasterizers and ray tracers do not guarantee the order with which surfaces are sampled. To circumvent this problem, textures are synthesized beforehand at some maximum resolution and rendered using texture mapping. We describe a search-based texture synthesis algorithm in which samples can be generated in arbitrary order, yet the resulting texture remains identical. The key to our algorithm is a pyramidal representation in which each texture sample depends only on a fixed number of neighboring samples at each level of the pyramid. The bottom (coarsest) level of the pyramid consists of a noise image, which is small and predetermined. When a sample is requested by the renderer, all samples on which it depends are generated at once. Using this approach, samples can be generated in any order. To make the algorithm efficient, we propose storing texture samples and their dependents in a pyramidal cache. Although the first few samples are expensive to generate, there is substantial reuse, so subsequent samples cost less. Fortunately, most rendering algorithms exhibit good coherence, so cache reuse is high.","Wei, Li-Yi;Levoy, Marc",ArXiv e-prints,"[X04a7c0158, X071b1bf2d, X076b77b49, X08eec237a, X0cfc12d8a, X158996f96, X16628a179, X1734b60b1, X1a269cafa, X20048e11d, X265ff2069, X2a16f060d, X2eca543e5, X3a9f4a95c, X47a7cd99f, X4a7916f9d, X50af7bc6f, X5116b87f9, X65821f94f, X6e00993f1, X6f74fbb9c, X7284324ce, X7302ad5a0, X752cbbd3f, X78f8a62b3, X7b177f1d8, X7f45548a8, X8e96b2fc3, X92477adf8, X928daeea3, X9740979f2, Xa3b8d3bff, Xaa8a0fcd4, Xb9842ea64, Xbb4994a2b, Xc0f1827f5, Xc112616d5, Xc21eb79bd, Xc4ead6e6f, Xc63aa4a29, Xc703a6eff, Xcb2b885f7, Xd3210b23c, Xde1859f67, Xe26aae5ac, Xe61de66a4, Xebd152b25, Xf0eff5f78, Xf3b7ff4f8, Xf41a7ac20, Xf67ad961f, Xfe5d42621, Xffecf49bb]",X04a7c0158;X071b1bf2d;X076b77b49;X08eec237a;X0cfc12d8a;X158996f96;X16628a179;X1734b60b1;X1a269cafa;X20048e11d;X265ff2069;X2a16f060d;X2eca543e5;X3a9f4a95c;X47a7cd99f;X4a7916f9d;X50af7bc6f;X5116b87f9;X65821f94f;X6e00993f1;X6f74fbb9c;X7284324ce;X7302ad5a0;X752cbbd3f;X78f8a62b3;X7b177f1d8;X7f45548a8;X8e96b2fc3;X92477adf8;X928daeea3;X9740979f2;Xa3b8d3bff;Xaa8a0fcd4;Xb9842ea64;Xbb4994a2b;Xc0f1827f5;Xc112616d5;Xc21eb79bd;Xc4ead6e6f;Xc63aa4a29;Xc703a6eff;Xcb2b885f7;Xd3210b23c;Xde1859f67;Xe26aae5ac;Xe61de66a4;Xebd152b25;Xf0eff5f78;Xf3b7ff4f8;Xf41a7ac20;Xf67ad961f;Xfe5d42621;Xffecf49bb,53,Order-Independent Texture Synthesis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7338,2014
207,"Background: Visualization of multi-channel microscopy data plays a vital role in biological research. With the ever-increasing resolution of modern microscopes the data set size of the scanned specimen grows steadily. On commodity hardware this size easily exceeds the available main memory and the even more limited GPU memory. Common volume rendering techniques require the entire data set to be present in the GPU memory. Existing out-of-core rendering approaches for large volume data sets either are limited to single-channel volumes, or require a computer cluster, or have long preprocessing times. Results: We introduce a ray-casting technique for rendering large volumetric multi-channel microscopy data streams on commodity hardware. The volumetric data is managed at different levels of detail by an octree structure. In contrast to previous octree-based techniques, the octree is built incrementally and therefore supports streamed microscopy data as well as data set sizes exceeding the available main memory. Furthermore, our approach allows the user to interact with the partially rendered data set at all stages of the octree construction. After a detailed description of our method, we present performance results for different multi-channel data sets with a size of up to 24 GB on a standard desktop PC. Conclusions: Our rendering technique allows biologists to visualize their scanned specimen on their standard desktop computers without high-end hardware requirements. Furthermore, the user can interact with the data set during the initial loading to explore the already loaded parts, change rendering parameters like color maps or adjust clipping planes. Thus, the time of biologists being idle is reduced. Also, streamed data can be visualized to detect and stop flawed scans early during the scan process.","Brix, Tobias;Praßni, Jörg-Stefan;Hinrichs, Klaus",ArXiv e-prints,"[X04a1f5551, X06d4e3293, X33d65045e, X35d8b20a2, X3634c965d, X374fd329e, X3e13aa5cc, X42d5fbb80, X4fa4b188b, X530aa41af, X63f03c7bf, X69c6364d2, X6cef6c00d, X803b100aa, X88aad25be, X896b4e265, Xac5413575, Xaf111ecba, Xb23b2c2c0, Xce2a0c50f, Xea0f3aa9a, Xfc4bc9322]",X04a1f5551;X06d4e3293;X33d65045e;X35d8b20a2;X3634c965d;X374fd329e;X3e13aa5cc;X42d5fbb80;X4fa4b188b;X530aa41af;X63f03c7bf;X69c6364d2;X6cef6c00d;X803b100aa;X88aad25be;X896b4e265;Xac5413575;Xaf111ecba;Xb23b2c2c0;Xce2a0c50f;Xea0f3aa9a;Xfc4bc9322,22,Visualization of Large Volumetric Multi-Channel Microscopy Data Streams on Standard PCs,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2074,2014

209,"We use the k-core decomposition to visualize large scale complex networks in two dimensions. This decomposition, based on a recursive pruning of the least connected vertices, allows to disentangle the hierarchical structure of networks by progressively focusing on their central cores. By using this strategy we develop a general visualization algorithm that can be used to compare the structural properties of various networks and highlight their hierarchical structure. The low computational complexity of the algorithm, O(n+e), where 'n' is the size of the network, and 'e' is the number of edges, makes it suitable for the visualization of very large sparse networks. We apply the proposed visualization tool to several real and synthetic graphs, showing its utility in finding specific structural fingerprints of computer generated and real world networks.","Alvarez-Hamelin, José Ignacio;Dall'Asta, Luca;Barrat, Alain;Vespignani, Alessandro",ArXiv e-prints,"[X073fed04c, X0794b3929, X0c2acfdf9, X0f4e06744, X0ffe6e27b, X11107a299, X14381ed89, X14f359c28, X15d6efde9, X165e5396a, X19517cbbc, X1bbbd8613, X1c5e33d3a, X1d3c93d39, X1de03bdcf, X20072a4b3, X2207fe0e3, X2246aca5d, X23187033d, X2331605c8, X233a0409c, X24cbd6884, X26cb07366, X27954cbc9, X28354bade, X2abd07cac, X2baaabf12, X2cb16ecfa, X31ffc89f9, X32461f0d7, X3664b2c04, X37824a08c, X3eac99194, X45106cc4c, X47790cf92, X49956140f, X49f3db7b2, X4abaafcb6, X4c10038eb, X4d31c0bcc, X4f6ea6487, X523f90b31, X539f33979, X55b4a2b7f, X59d5c5b14, X5d83507c1, X5e2800d5c, X6050bf5ca, X619858f28, X6233a8754, X63e051f42, X6515b1d3b, X6666555df, X691d987f1, X69df7a045, X71546a94a, X71788457a, X7419b3e0f, X7bae891b6, X7ce43fb03, X80d6ed1a6, X8230a3f94, X84c156788, X85c21859a, X87ef18fe5, X891f627ba, X8cd0e67aa, X9099e9382, X9192f92f6, X9364f12d1, X9371f5b62, X967957c4b, X96b43c547, X98c3f49b6, X98f27c021, X9950d54b5, X99ceab86b, X99f2bf7f4, X9a8183229, X9baf67b33, X9f815f2d3, X9f93b46ba, Xa206a4cba, Xa2224b2a6, Xa38371d1d, Xa5dd83193, Xa69aaa5e3, Xa726c8e71, Xa81d5a9db, Xaaf808a96, Xade7d215a, Xb0881b9c5, Xb0f05d329, Xb1589068b, Xb1af25463, Xb5d1756d1, Xb691aea33, Xb691beee8, Xb89737a1d, Xb9fc7b629, ...]",X073fed04c;X0794b3929;X0c2acfdf9;X0f4e06744;X0ffe6e27b;X11107a299;X14381ed89;X14f359c28;X15d6efde9;X165e5396a;X19517cbbc;X1bbbd8613;X1c5e33d3a;X1d3c93d39;X1de03bdcf;X20072a4b3;X2207fe0e3;X2246aca5d;X23187033d;X2331605c8;X233a0409c;X24cbd6884;X26cb07366;X27954cbc9;X28354bade;X2abd07cac;X2baaabf12;X2cb16ecfa;X31ffc89f9;X32461f0d7;X3664b2c04;X37824a08c;X3eac99194;X45106cc4c;X47790cf92;X49956140f;X49f3db7b2;X4abaafcb6;X4c10038eb;X4d31c0bcc;X4f6ea6487;X523f90b31;X539f33979;X55b4a2b7f;X59d5c5b14;X5d83507c1;X5e2800d5c;X6050bf5ca;X619858f28;X6233a8754;X63e051f42;X6515b1d3b;X6666555df;X691d987f1;X69df7a045;X71546a94a;X71788457a;X7419b3e0f;X7bae891b6;X7ce43fb03;X80d6ed1a6;X8230a3f94;X84c156788;X85c21859a;X87ef18fe5;X891f627ba;X8cd0e67aa;X9099e9382;X9192f92f6;X9364f12d1;X9371f5b62;X967957c4b;X96b43c547;X98c3f49b6;X98f27c021;X9950d54b5;X99ceab86b;X99f2bf7f4;X9a8183229;X9baf67b33;X9f815f2d3;X9f93b46ba;Xa206a4cba;Xa2224b2a6;Xa38371d1d;Xa5dd83193;Xa69aaa5e3;Xa726c8e71;Xa81d5a9db;Xaaf808a96;Xade7d215a;Xb0881b9c5;Xb0f05d329;Xb1589068b;Xb1af25463;Xb5d1756d1;Xb691aea33;Xb691beee8;Xb89737a1d;Xb9fc7b629;Xba8f05091;Xbeaeb4d5e;Xbfbed5270;Xc13710b9b;Xc19941b94;Xc38953b78;Xc39ed9e04;Xc3d1a3c2c;Xd391ae2fe;Xd56868eeb;Xd70db4a5f;Xdc2391510;Xde2176d02;Xdefb87399;Xe1cde41d6;Xe2efb68cb;Xe46fb211d;Xea9ea1cf3;Xeb807df10;Xeb86cd0bc;Xec74f1d53;Xee9906918;Xf0da8c4cb;Xf191c6afe;Xf4cfc6483;Xf5d6bd48c;Xf7954e6f9;Xf9340e2c6;Xffc527ce6;Xffd1c6991,130,k-core decomposition: a tool for the visualization of large scale networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0504107,2005
210,"Results: We present an application that enables the quantitative analysis of multichannel 5-D (x, y, z, t, channel) and large montage confocal fluorescence microscopy images. The image sequences show stem cells together with blood vessels, enabling quantification of the dynamic behaviors of stem cells in relation to their vascular niche, with applications in developmental and cancer biology. Our application automatically segments, tracks, and lineages the image sequence data and then allows the user to view and edit the results of automated algorithms in a stereoscopic 3-D window while simultaneously viewing the stem cell lineage tree in a 2-D window. Using the GPU to store and render the image sequence data enables a hybrid computational approach. An inference-based approach utilizing user-provided edits to automatically correct related mistakes executes interactively on the system CPU while the GPU handles 3-D visualization tasks. Conclusions: By exploiting commodity computer gaming hardware, we have developed an application that can be run in the laboratory to facilitate rapid iteration through biological experiments. There is a pressing need for visualization and analysis tools for 5-D live cell image data. We combine accurate unsupervised processes with an intuitive visualization of the results. Our validation interface allows for each data set to be corrected to 100% accuracy, ensuring that downstream data analysis is accurate and verifiable. Our tool is the first to combine all of these aspects, leveraging the synergies obtained by utilizing validation information from stereo visualization to improve the low level image processing tasks.","Wait, Eric;Winter, Mark;Bjornsson, Chris;Kokovay, Erzsebet;Wang, Yue;Goderie, Susan;Temple, Sally;Cohen, Andrew",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00fa7a190, X07477c602, X183a8104d, X1d97766ae, X1f079a9e8, X1fe5809e9, X2020f8120, X35a75f905, X3d874f877, X495f80981, X5934664f3, X5b21dfcac, X6235fae48, X64bd13fbb, X688854810, X6e0211cb7, X838df860a, X8cc677213, Xb01aa1cce, Xb41c6e66e, Xbe4e39122, Xde08ff252, Xf0c24f1b2]",X00fa7a190;X07477c602;X183a8104d;X1d97766ae;X1f079a9e8;X1fe5809e9;X2020f8120;X35a75f905;X3d874f877;X495f80981;X5934664f3;X5b21dfcac;X6235fae48;X64bd13fbb;X688854810;X6e0211cb7;X838df860a;X8cc677213;Xb01aa1cce;Xb41c6e66e;Xbe4e39122;Xde08ff252;Xf0c24f1b2,23,"Visualization and Correction of Automated Segmentation, Tracking and Lineaging from 5-D Stem Cell Image Sequences",http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2089,2014
211,"Background: Cancers are highly heterogeneous with different subtypes. These subtypes often possess different genetic variants, present different pathological phenotypes, and most importantly, show various clinical outcomes such as varied prognosis and response to treatment and likelihood for recurrence and metastasis. Recently, integrative genomics (or panomics) approaches are often adopted with the goal of combining multiple types of omics data to identify integrative biomarkers for stratification of patients into groups with different clinical outcomes. Results: In this paper we present a visual analytic system called Interactive Genomics Patient Stratification explorer (iGPSe) which significantly reduces the computing burden for biomedical researchers in the process of exploring complicated integrative genomics data. Our system integrates unsupervised clustering with graph and parallel sets visualization and allows direct comparison of clinical outcomes via survival analysis. Using a breast cancer dataset obtained from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, we are able to quickly explore different combinations of gene expression (mRNA) and microRNA features and identify potential combined markers for survival prediction. Conclusions: Visualization plays an important role in the process of stratifying given population patients. Visual tools allowed for the selection of possibly features across various datasets for the given patient population.

213,"Background: Biological data often originate from samples containing mixtures of subpopulations, corresponding e.g. to distinct cellular phenotypes. However, identification of distinct subpopulations may be difficult if biological measurements yield distributions that are not easily separable. Results: We present Multiresolution Correlation Analysis (MCA), a method for visually identifying subpopulations based on the local pairwise correlation between covariates, without needing to define an a priori interaction scale. We demonstrate that MCA facilitates the identification of differentially regulated subpopulations in simulated data from a small gene regulatory network, followed by application to previously published single-cell qPCR data from mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that MCA recovers previously identified subpopulations, provides additional insight into the underlying correlation structure, reveals potentially spurious compartmentalizations, and provides insight into novel subpopulations. Conclusions: MCA is a useful method for the identification of subpopulations in low-dimensional expression data, as emerging from qPCR or FACS measurements. With MCA it is possible to investigate the robustness of covariate correlations with respect subpopulations, graphically identify outliers, and identify factors contributing to differential regulation between pairs of covariates. MCA thus provides a framework for investigation of expression correlations for genes of interests and biological hypothesis generation.","Feigelman, Justin;Theis, Fabian J.;Marr, Carsten",ArXiv e-prints,"[X06964f3e1, X2e87b3d61, X3f6310e7d, X495f80981, X61fb3b5fa, X8f88e9009, X972627bfe, X9c0ede507, Xbde2153e9, Xc6386ac1d, Xcd0b55a57, Xee523ca69]",X06964f3e1;X2e87b3d61;X3f6310e7d;X495f80981;X61fb3b5fa;X8f88e9009;X972627bfe;X9c0ede507;Xbde2153e9;Xc6386ac1d;Xcd0b55a57;Xee523ca69,12,"MCA: Multiresolution Correlation Analysis, a graphical tool for subpopulation identification in single-cell gene expression data",http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2112,2014
214,"Separation of the text regions from background texture and graphics is an important step of any optical character recognition system for the images containing both texts and graphics. In this paper, we have presented a novel text/graphics separation technique and a method for skew correction of text regions extracted from business card images captured with a cell-phone camera. At first, the background is eliminated at a coarse level based on intensity variance. This makes the foreground components distinct from each other. Then the non-text components are removed using various characteristic features of text and graphics. Finally, the text regions are skew corrected for further processing. Experimenting with business card images of various resolutions, we have found an optimum performance of 98.25% (recall) with 0.75 MP images, that takes 0.17 seconds processing time and 1.1 MB peak memory on a moderately powerful computer (DualCore 1.73 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 1 MB L2 Cache).

215,"Background: The biological world is replete with phenomena that appear to be ideally modeled and analyzed by one archetypal statistical framework - the Graphical Probabilistic Model (GPM). The structure of GPMs is a uniquely good match for biological problems that range from aligning sequences to modeling the genome-to-phenome relationship. The fundamental questions that GPMs address involve making decisions based on a complex web of interacting factors. Unfortunately, while GPMs ideally fit many questions in biology, they are not an easy solution to apply. Building a GPM is not a simple task for an end user. Moreover, applying GPMs is also impeded by the insidious fact that the complex web of interacting factors inherent to a problem might be easy to define and also intractable to compute upon. Discussion: We propose that the visualization sciences can contribute to many domains of the bio-sciences, by developing tools to address archetypal representation and user interaction issues in GPMs, and in particular a variety of GPM called a Conditional Random Field(CRF). CRFs bring additional power, and additional complexity, because the CRF dependency network can be conditioned on the query data. Conclusions: In this manuscript we examine the shared features of several biological problems that are amenable to modeling with CRFs, highlight the challenges that existing visualization and visual analytics paradigms induce for these data, and document an experimental solution called StickWRLD which, while leaving room for improvement, has been successfully applied in several biological research projects.","Ray, William C.;Wolock, Samuel L.;Callahan, Nicholas W;Dong, Min;Quinn Li, Q.;Liang, Chun;Magliery, Thomas J;Bartlett, Christopher W.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X6c0cbaa2b, X6d28f4b80, X879f4e29b, X899b6d40a, Xa501b5618, Xc6efb45b9, Xed564d49a, Xf8987ca1c]",X6c0cbaa2b;X6d28f4b80;X879f4e29b;X899b6d40a;Xa501b5618;Xc6efb45b9;Xed564d49a;Xf8987ca1c,8,Addressing the unmet need for visualizing Conditional Random Fields in Biological Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2110,2014
216,"Results of number of geometric operations (often used in technical practise, as e.g. the operation of blending) are in many cases surfaces described implicitly. Then it is a challenging task to recognize the type of the obtained surface, find its characteristics and for the rational surfaces compute also their parameterizations. In this contribution we will focus on surfaces of revolution. These objects, widely used in geometric modelling, are generated by rotating a generatrix around a given axis. If the generatrix is an algebraic curve then so is also the resulting surface, described uniquely by a polynomial which can be found by some well-established implicitation technique. However, starting from a polynomial it is not known how to decide if the corresponding algebraic surface is rotational or not. Motivated by this, our goal is to formulate a simple and efficient algorithm whose input is a polynomial with the coefficients from some subfield of $\mathbb{R}$ and the output is the answer whether the shape is a surface of revolution. In the affirmative case we also find the equations of its axis and generatrix. Furthermore, we investigate the problem of rationality and unirationality of surfaces of revolution and show that this question can be efficiently answered discussing the rationality of a certain associated planar curve.","Vršek, Jan;Lávička, Miroslav",ArXiv e-prints,"[X15826ca1e, X1c63dbadf, X2685e3fd0, X39acf7a59, X52df86cf3, X793d5102e, X904ac0979, X9dffda426, Xb385f695f, Xc3396f21a, Xc819293fb, Xd160300ae]",X15826ca1e;X1c63dbadf;X2685e3fd0;X39acf7a59;X52df86cf3;X793d5102e;X904ac0979;X9dffda426;Xb385f695f;Xc3396f21a;Xc819293fb;Xd160300ae,12,Determining surfaces of revolution from their implicit equations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2723,2014

The resource provides comprehensive search facilities, but few analytical tools or visual mechanisms for navigating the data set. To deal with the missing visual navigation, this paper explores the application of sunburst and icicle visualizations within EMAGE. Results: A prototype solution delivered a simple user interface that helps the user query EMAGE and generate a sunburst/icicle diagram. An evaluation featuring test subjects from the EMAGE staff studied the visualizations and provided a range of suggested improvements. Moreover the evaluation discovered that in addition to providing a visual means of walking through the data, when grouped, the sunburst delivers an interactive overview that assists with analysing sets of related genes. Conclusions: The sunburst and icicle visualizations have been shown to be effective tools for summarising gene expression data. The sunburst with its space saving radial layout was found especially useful for providing an overview of gene families or pathways.

The lensless zoomable holographic projection in this paper is capable of projecting multiple images onto tilted planes simultaneously.","Shimobaba, Tomoyoshi;Makowski, Michal;Kakue, Takashi;Okada, Naohisa;Endo, Yutaka;Hirayama, Ryuji;Hiyama, Daisuke;Hasegawa, Satoki;Nagahama, Yuki;Ito, Tomoyoshi",Optics Communications,"[X01460a1c7, X01ea8c9f4, X04af98486, X186c0c77d, X244189d82, X2b43b9966, X421f1b365, X4a8c4216b, X672b97b75, X7395cab7d, X73a305f0a, X9fa839b98, Xa9b81c243, Xba97e1874, Xca135b8c4, Xd066986ea, Xd9dd51681, Xdb6d1d74d, Xe0da74d7c, Xe1b05e7f4, Xf294071aa, Xf83c2ce0a]",X01460a1c7;X01ea8c9f4;X04af98486;X186c0c77d;X244189d82;X2b43b9966;X421f1b365;X4a8c4216b;X672b97b75;X7395cab7d;X73a305f0a;X9fa839b98;Xa9b81c243;Xba97e1874;Xca135b8c4;Xd066986ea;Xd9dd51681;Xdb6d1d74d;Xe0da74d7c;Xe1b05e7f4;Xf294071aa;Xf83c2ce0a,22,Numerical investigation of lensless zoomable holographic multiple projections to tilted planes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2971,2014
220,"Big data volume continues to grow at unprecedented rates. One of the key features that makes big data valuable is the promise to find unknown patterns or correlations that may be able to improve the quality of processes or systems. Unfortunately, with the exponential growth in data, users often have difficulty in visualizing the often-unstructured, non-homogeneous data coming from a variety of sources. The recent growth in popularity of 3D printing has ushered in a revolutionary way to interact with big data. Using a 3D printed mockup up a physical or notional environment, one can display data on the mockup to show real-time data patterns. In this poster and demonstration, we describe the process of 3D printing and demonstrate an application of displaying Twitter data on a 3D mockup of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) campus, known as LuminoCity.","Weber, Zachary;Gadepally, Vijay",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00bd80b2c, X01a754b35, X02da3358e, X04cfe2896, X0629561a6, X08cb5856e, X0adccc220, X0fab3c269, X154ee3f66, X15a123a3c, X1b219ab49, X216518a6d, X23c14e149, X2548785b8, X27e75ec88, X29460916a, X2ff76e0ad, X325e8ec2f, X3349a5b7e, X340df3121, X34b080157, X35c7f159e, X35f8e4141, X3811fa4ff, X3929909d0, X3c467ceb8, X3d2b12027, X3df06a147, X3f7f0afdb, X42052e9c6, X4346c05bb, X4685c8146, X4745d75eb, X48e8c4feb, X49f2fd98f, X4b6cb1b84, X4ea3a82b5, X558c251c2, X57694474f, X5916af458, X5e4eb5cf5, X5f7990805, X5fa7e6812, X6374b8178, X68c497887, X68d986545, X72ecdd04d, X7533056a9, X7613dfd95, X7872c6bd9, X7bbb77ee1, X7d05cd6ec, X7d283997a, X7ec4f97f8, X8022aa22a, X8a40390e1, X8af5d071b, X8bb1e130c, X8de2127f6, X8ff04f24e, X9056155e4, X94fa13b4c, X9579413aa, X9641145a6, X97743957b, X98a67d233, X995412727, X9d48202b2, X9db9cea94, Xa0a6ea9a9, Xa0db24798, Xa467d5468, Xa5b4f59e8, Xa7a244d2f, Xab5dd820d, Xabaecfde5, Xac25e528a, Xadadce91f, Xadc758fef, Xaffb70d40, Xb373ec4fa, Xbe7e5acd3, Xbed5c61d6, Xc0aac609a, Xc2c340518, Xc327e501b, Xc6d03609d, Xca79c2ae1, Xcc8586e6e, Xcd95cb1f1, Xd0984c1b6, Xd0b6019d4, Xd11d8cebc, Xd206af40c, Xd746cb651, Xdc9e22c30, Xdcbcfaceb, Xe006886c8, Xe1138383a, Xe4e4d2d49, ...]",X00bd80b2c;X01a754b35;X02da3358e;X04cfe2896;X0629561a6;X08cb5856e;X0adccc220;X0fab3c269;X154ee3f66;X15a123a3c;X1b219ab49;X216518a6d;X23c14e149;X2548785b8;X27e75ec88;X29460916a;X2ff76e0ad;X325e8ec2f;X3349a5b7e;X340df3121;X34b080157;X35c7f159e;X35f8e4141;X3811fa4ff;X3929909d0;X3c467ceb8;X3d2b12027;X3df06a147;X3f7f0afdb;X42052e9c6;X4346c05bb;X4685c8146;X4745d75eb;X48e8c4feb;X49f2fd98f;X4b6cb1b84;X4ea3a82b5;X558c251c2;X57694474f;X5916af458;X5e4eb5cf5;X5f7990805;X5fa7e6812;X6374b8178;X68c497887;X68d986545;X72ecdd04d;X7533056a9;X7613dfd95;X7872c6bd9;X7bbb77ee1;X7d05cd6ec;X7d283997a;X7ec4f97f8;X8022aa22a;X8a40390e1;X8af5d071b;X8bb1e130c;X8de2127f6;X8ff04f24e;X9056155e4;X94fa13b4c;X9579413aa;X9641145a6;X97743957b;X98a67d233;X995412727;X9d48202b2;X9db9cea94;Xa0a6ea9a9;Xa0db24798;Xa467d5468;Xa5b4f59e8;Xa7a244d2f;Xab5dd820d;Xabaecfde5;Xac25e528a;Xadadce91f;Xadc758fef;Xaffb70d40;Xb373ec4fa;Xbe7e5acd3;Xbed5c61d6;Xc0aac609a;Xc2c340518;Xc327e501b;Xc6d03609d;Xca79c2ae1;Xcc8586e6e;Xcd95cb1f1;Xd0984c1b6;Xd0b6019d4;Xd11d8cebc;Xd206af40c;Xd746cb651;Xdc9e22c30;Xdcbcfaceb;Xe006886c8;Xe1138383a;Xe4e4d2d49;Xe54ba3453;Xe793e95b2;Xe9d8d6519;Xebb056bc4;Xef9542cbe;Xf0d482030;Xf0dfe959e;Xf1014c8ef;Xf10de8ad4;Xf1fb8fc8e;Xf4acb88b1;Xf4d9a71e9;Xf52efcf4f;Xf9150679e;Xf959e818c,115,Using 3D Printing to Visualize Social Media Big Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7724,2014

222,"In this paper, it is presented a methodology to estimate the deformation involved between two objects attending to its physical properties. This methodology can be used, for example, in Computational Vision or Computer Graphics applications, and consists in physically modeling the objects, by means of the Finite Elements Method, establishing correspondences between some of its data points, by using Modal Matching, and finally, determining the displacement field, that is the intermediate shapes, through the resolution of the Lagrange Dynamic Equilibrium Equation. As in many of the possible applications of the methodology to present, it is necessary to quantify the existing deformation, as well as to estimate only the non rigid component of the involved global deformation. The solutions adopted to satisfy such intentions will be also presented.","Tavares, Joao Manuel R.

223,The first part of the article describes our approach for solution of this problem by means of Augmented Reality. The merging of the real world model and digital objects allows streamline the work with the model and speed up the whole production phase significantly. The main advantage of augmented reality is the possibility of direct manipulation with the scene using a portable digital camera. Also adding digital objects into the scene could be done using identification markers placed on the surface of the model. Therefore it is not necessary to work with special input devices and lose the contact with the real world model. Adjustments are done directly on the model. The key problem of outlined solution is the ability of identification of an object within the camera picture and its replacement with the digital object. The second part of the article is focused especially on the identification of exact position and orientation of the marker within the picture. The identification marker is generalized into the triple of points which represents a general plane in space. There is discussed the space identification of these points and the description of representation of their position and orientation be means of transformation matrix. This matrix is used for rendering of the graphical objects (e. g. in OpenGL and Direct3D).,"Stastny, Jiri;Prochazka, David;Koubek, Tomas;Landa, Jaromir",ArXiv e-prints,"[X16f4d2743, X24528b55a, X28e774346, X60175db78, X6c6dd75a2, X8a91ae942, X8be900863, Xf05885e8e]",X16f4d2743;X24528b55a;X28e774346;X60175db78;X6c6dd75a2;X8a91ae942;X8be900863;Xf05885e8e,8,Augmented reality usage for prototyping speed up,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2063,2011

225,"In this paper, we revisit the design of synchronization primitives---specifically barriers, mutexes, and semaphores---and how they apply to the GPU. Previous implementations are insufficient due to the discrepancies in hardware and programming model of the GPU and CPU. We create new implementations in CUDA and analyze the performance of spinning on the GPU, as well as a method of sleeping on the GPU, by running a set of memory-system benchmarks on two of the most common GPUs in use, the Tesla- and Fermi-class GPUs from NVIDIA. From our results we define higher-level principles that are valid for generic many-core processors, the most important of which is to limit the number of atomic accesses required for a synchronization operation because atomic accesses are slower than regular memory accesses. We use the results of the benchmarks to critique existing synchronization algorithms and guide our new implementations, and then define an abstraction of GPUs to classify any GPU based on the behavior of the memory system. We use this abstraction to create suitable implementations of the primitives specifically targeting the GPU, and analyze the performance of these algorithms on Tesla and Fermi. We then predict performance on future GPUs based on characteristics of the abstraction. We also examine the roles of spin waiting and sleep waiting in each primitive and how their performance varies based on the machine abstraction, then give a set of guidelines for when each strategy is useful based on the characteristics of the GPU and expected contention.","Stuart, Jeff A.;Owens, John D.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X09957a4ef, X0e5f08279, X10877dc91, X129ef3155, X164672948, X17747bd6c, X1b0ee3590, X1bed9ed31, X1d68499c3, X20f19cd8d, X391df1592, X3ccfa890d, X6145347ba, X632e460e9, X65f8b41b2, X6907faabe, X6a380a9cf, X72119c86d, X7f7dd9e0d, X8019f7279, X81edf5685, X88e685277, X8c1b2ba5d, X8c32d341f, X975ffe237, X97d360d3d, Xaa1383a38, Xabc1145de, Xaeb600a8a, Xbe276485f, Xc500db453, Xe039073a5, Xf5bd40026, Xfa00d2124]",X09957a4ef;X0e5f08279;X10877dc91;X129ef3155;X164672948;X17747bd6c;X1b0ee3590;X1bed9ed31;X1d68499c3;X20f19cd8d;X391df1592;X3ccfa890d;X6145347ba;X632e460e9;X65f8b41b2;X6907faabe;X6a380a9cf;X72119c86d;X7f7dd9e0d;X8019f7279;X81edf5685;X88e685277;X8c1b2ba5d;X8c32d341f;X975ffe237;X97d360d3d;Xaa1383a38;Xabc1145de;Xaeb600a8a;Xbe276485f;Xc500db453;Xe039073a5;Xf5bd40026;Xfa00d2124,34,Efficient Synchronization Primitives for GPUs,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4623,2011
226,"Analysis of high dimensional data is a common task. Often, small multiples are used to visualize 1 or 2 dimensions at a time, such as in a scatterplot matrix. Associating data points between different views can be difficult though, as the points are not fixed. Other times, dimensional reduction techniques are employed to summarize the whole dataset in one image, but individual dimensions are lost in this view. In this paper, we present a means of augmenting a dimensional reduction plot with isocontours to reintroduce the original dimensions. By applying this to each dimension in the original data, we create multiple views where the points are consistent, which facilitates their comparison. Our approach employs a combination of a novel, graph-based projection technique with a GPU accelerated implementation of moving least squares to interpolate space between the points. We also present evaluations of this approach both with a case study and with a user study.","Muelder, Chris W.;Leaf, Nick;Sigovan, Carmen;Ma, Kwan-Liu",ArXiv e-prints,"[X06d4e3293, X0bf8b1d7a, X0f0ef970f, X19c910d71, X1afbe4829, X218912660, X29660a306, X2dc9f9336, X2eba43c28, X2fc6edd3a, X3680c2762, X51f89e8bb, X58ba58e16, X59c5f7db3, X59f52c084, X5cb1606a9, X8527a0b95, X866e699c2, X9481ceea6, X995412727, X9f15f3994, Xb373ec4fa, Xb4f2b4d15, Xd2a41a3dd, Xe04d25006, Xf9f36b497]",X06d4e3293;X0bf8b1d7a;X0f0ef970f;X19c910d71;X1afbe4829;X218912660;X29660a306;X2dc9f9336;X2eba43c28;X2fc6edd3a;X3680c2762;X51f89e8bb;X58ba58e16;X59c5f7db3;X59f52c084;X5cb1606a9;X8527a0b95;X866e699c2;X9481ceea6;X995412727;X9f15f3994;Xb373ec4fa;Xb4f2b4d15;Xd2a41a3dd;Xe04d25006;Xf9f36b497,26,A Moving Least Squares Based Approach for Contour Visualization of Multi-Dimensional Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0677,2014
227,"Harmonic surface deformation is a well-known geometric modeling method that creates plausible deformations in an interactive manner. However, this method is susceptible to artifacts, in particular close to the deformation handles. These artifacts often correlate with strong gradients of the deformation energy.In this work, we propose a novel formulation of harmonic surface deformation, which incorporates a regularization of the deformation energy. To do so, we build on and extend a recently introduced generic linear regularization approach. It can be expressed as a change of norm for the linear optimization problem, i.e., the regularization is baked into the optimization. This minimizes the implementation complexity and has only a small impact on runtime. Our results show that a moderate use of regularization suppresses many deformation artifacts common to the well-known harmonic surface deformation method, without introducing new artifacts.","Kozlov, Yeara;Martinez Esturo, Janick;Seidel, Hans-Peter;Weinkauf, Tino",ArXiv e-prints,"[X2253029f6, X2eba43c28, X3ccc9e7b0, X574531cf7, X96f2e38b3, X99af0e13b, X9e2b0ed80, Xc933d0bd4]",X2253029f6;X2eba43c28;X3ccc9e7b0;X574531cf7;X96f2e38b3;X99af0e13b;X9e2b0ed80;Xc933d0bd4,8,Regularized Harmonic Surface Deformation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3326,2014
228,"We introduce a framework for the generation of grid-shell structures that is based on Voronoi diagrams and allows us to design tessellations that achieve excellent static performances. We start from an analysis of stress on the input surface and we use the resulting tensor field to induce an anisotropic non-Euclidean metric over it. Then we compute a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation under the same metric. The resulting mesh is hex-dominant and made of cells with a variable density, which depends on the amount of stress, and anisotropic shape, which depends on the direction of maximum stress. This mesh is further optimized taking into account symmetry and regularity of cells to improve aesthetics. We demonstrate that our grid-shells achieve better static performances with respect to quad-based grid shells, while offering an innovative and aesthetically pleasing look.","Pietroni, Nico;Tonelli, Davide;Puppo, Enrico;Froli, Maurizio;Scopigno, Roberto;Cignoni, Paolo",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00c73e270, X01aa703e0, X02bc4f089, X07fbc17dc, X09c51a298, X0a90e9e8d, X0af0560ea, X0b51e00e9, X0d09b97ce, X0e2790a84, X0e82e0b7b, X10722a565, X156700c88, X166e48897, X169dcde92, X16a274155, X1783ff1e0, X17f7f0737, X18bf091ea, X18d91e4ba, X1c852c16c, X236d5789b, X23c5a3740, X248522a40, X2642d759d, X2747ab953, X29388c271, X2c0cc5bf8, X2d71c3a69, X2eba43c28, X2ee3c6c4e, X2ffd5fcb0, X305a92d93, X30f2f2c92, X33d3b8da2, X36341eea3, X3708c2be4, X3777ef834, X380c1e15a, X39acf7a59, X3bbc8d395, X3bede90c0, X3cb0b5382, X3cf50454c, X3d4ba0930, X3e5411483, X40cf9db72, X416dc32fc, X4248b64bd, X42f9097f7, X43123565e, X43f16eda9, X493ab31a1, X4b41b7ca5, X4f22233e0, X51ab016ae, X54fa5256f, X560e3ac7d, X5976a18ec, X5ac2dc74f, X5c32f0d38, X5e05a4719, X5e880bfc0, X5edf29907, X5ee759814, X5f9f1c4ba, X62a6c87f9, X662c90f2b, X668d971f7, X6731ce22f, X685d71fe9, X694c0a046, X6a893f35f, X6be535cf2, X6c2fdbc3e, X6c94d27b0, X6e27305c8, X6fae3eacc, X70a0bc52f, X74e878258, X76f580f3b, X78eda138f, X79220facf, X7950021ff, X7a75c1787, X7a845f901, X7b6d8c044, X7c0b4fbec, X7cde20353, X7ce64aa17, X7e24362d3, X80946abb7, X80faeca74, X82d28902e, X82e19ba07, X855858e1b, X859d229df, X8727945a7, X884e70fc5, X8a49512e8, ...]",X00c73e270;X01aa703e0;X02bc4f089;X07fbc17dc;X09c51a298;X0a90e9e8d;X0af0560ea;X0b51e00e9;X0d09b97ce;X0e2790a84;X0e82e0b7b;X10722a565;X156700c88;X166e48897;X169dcde92;X16a274155;X1783ff1e0;X17f7f0737;X18bf091ea;X18d91e4ba;X1c852c16c;X236d5789b;X23c5a3740;X248522a40;X2642d759d;X2747ab953;X29388c271;X2c0cc5bf8;X2d71c3a69;X2eba43c28;X2ee3c6c4e;X2ffd5fcb0;X305a92d93;X30f2f2c92;X33d3b8da2;X36341eea3;X3708c2be4;X3777ef834;X380c1e15a;X39acf7a59;X3bbc8d395;X3bede90c0;X3cb0b5382;X3cf50454c;X3d4ba0930;X3e5411483;X40cf9db72;X416dc32fc;X4248b64bd;X42f9097f7;X43123565e;X43f16eda9;X493ab31a1;X4b41b7ca5;X4f22233e0;X51ab016ae;X54fa5256f;X560e3ac7d;X5976a18ec;X5ac2dc74f;X5c32f0d38;X5e05a4719;X5e880bfc0;X5edf29907;X5ee759814;X5f9f1c4ba;X62a6c87f9;X662c90f2b;X668d971f7;X6731ce22f;X685d71fe9;X694c0a046;X6a893f35f;X6be535cf2;X6c2fdbc3e;X6c94d27b0;X6e27305c8;X6fae3eacc;X70a0bc52f;X74e878258;X76f580f3b;X78eda138f;X79220facf;X7950021ff;X7a75c1787;X7a845f901;X7b6d8c044;X7c0b4fbec;X7cde20353;X7ce64aa17;X7e24362d3;X80946abb7;X80faeca74;X82d28902e;X82e19ba07;X855858e1b;X859d229df;X8727945a7;X884e70fc5;X8a49512e8;X8a9f66a37;X8b3ac3f0c;X8b9ede3fe;X8dbcf2263;X8dc38611d;X8e7d91bab;X91fdec8a4;X9459e39b4;X94e2c59ab;X97d52512a;X9a57fa96c;X9aa379700;X9bd688eca;X9df1bbb45;X9e55b2a52;X9f90fb56b;Xa2e3ed966;Xa38a026cb;Xa580647fd;Xa67e7a1b1;Xa68acc6e7;Xa6f528a61;Xa8087e48f;Xaa1df42ba;Xab55d4e7d;Xac01aeb86;Xac39b1cfe;Xac54117f4;Xacb9e990a;Xacec556c3;Xad007d475;Xae3341ba8;Xae3ce8b2b;Xb061ec840;Xb0c5ea518;Xb1a9ebce0;Xb50f4f358;Xb6447eed2;Xb6993ffa6;Xb8007e55d;Xba516daa1;Xbac9f9105;Xbd3f3e53d;Xbed923faf;Xbf7f68987;Xbffc1ce2f;Xc19650687;Xc22758037;Xc49e30476;Xc54d050f5;Xc640ff38e;Xc76bcf509;Xc8ab5c136;Xc9d3f39ec;Xcc90235f7;Xcd365ca74;Xce216638d;Xce475f0ff;Xce5e92e49;Xcef390e7b;Xd0fa6a547;Xd21413af4;Xd29015be7;Xd36d25350;Xd3932a3fb;Xd603e84bc;Xd70ff59ea;Xd84f90dc7;Xd8d9ae25b;Xdabcf8de2;Xdd1268c6f;Xe0801e9bc;Xe122c9cf1;Xe1f82586e;Xe2dfb8186;Xe2f11bebb;Xe4ed6b6d3;Xe50a6606a;Xe6d952eab;Xea078a8df;Xecc083e2a;Xed1bce4bf;Xf0873aacc;Xf0c60f9f6;Xf33bde5c2;Xf36c83166;Xf430a29dd;Xf62a18c0e;Xf722a91be;Xf80e7eef9;Xf8b23a1c3;Xfb14b4047;Xfd8563aa7,193,Voronoi Grid-Shell Structures,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6591,2014
229,"Blue noise refers to sample distributions that are random and well-spaced, with a variety of applications in graphics, geometry, and optimization. However, prior blue noise sampling algorithms typically suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality, especially when striving to cover a domain maximally. This hampers their applicability for high dimensional domains. We present a blue noise sampling method that can achieve high quality and performance across different dimensions. Our key idea is spoke-dart sampling, sampling locally from hyper-annuli centered at prior point samples, using lines, planes, or, more generally, hyperplanes. Spoke-dart sampling is more efficient at high dimensions than the state-of-the-art alternatives: global sampling and advancing front point sampling. Spoke-dart sampling achieves good quality as measured by differential domain spectrum and spatial coverage. In particular, it probabilistically guarantees that each coverage gap is small, whereas global sampling can only guarantee that the sum of gaps is not large. We demonstrate advantages of our method through empirical analysis and applications across dimensions 8 to 23 in Delaunay graphs, global optimization, and motion planning.","Ebeida, Mohamed S.;Mitchell, Scott A.;Awad, Muhammad A.;Park, Chonhyon;Swiler, Laura P.;Manocha, Dinesh;Wei, Li-Yi",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00cee5edc, X03cfa2565, X042dfda11, X0664defaf, X0bf92c379, X1058f1deb, X16628a179, X1d22ecc9f, X22993c291, X2985b0a34, X2edfefbc0, X3b084a2c2, X3c42891fa, X3ed97e4e3, X3f0aee4a5, X40017beb6, X40ea1e186, X423e14cbd, X4b2436868, X4bca94e49, X51914a1fc, X57278d530, X58219c609, X6159a24e2, X63a653a8f, X65794841b, X6735bd890, X69f6e4ff2, X6b9aea454, X6ba2612ad, X6cff36603, X6e6adc70b, X6ebf5a13d, X7b8b1300d, X7d4763b66, X818d42899, X819f600f5, X8fd2f628f, X91aa2add2, X927936e4d, X928daeea3, X957ba0db5, X967a7dbd2, X9bb10791c, X9c4a8b758, X9f1ce7bbf, X9fa51bcf8, Xa0a604f4b, Xa5a33da71, Xa684393a7, Xac29dfb08, Xb205a2d5e, Xb2dc8e1a6, Xb2f9896e7, Xb36d43c16, Xba0c7d846, Xbe36ff108, Xbe6bfc79a, Xc5d9c04c1, Xd40b3fa09, Xd80cafdf3, Xdb350f703, Xe0d7ea1d7, Xe162f1313, Xe5fbd7662, Xeefd333cb, Xf0c60f9f6, Xf0cec6e61, Xf49ffe5ff, Xf75fdddb0, Xf858109af, Xffefc3366]",X00cee5edc;X03cfa2565;X042dfda11;X0664defaf;X0bf92c379;X1058f1deb;X16628a179;X1d22ecc9f;X22993c291;X2985b0a34;X2edfefbc0;X3b084a2c2;X3c42891fa;X3ed97e4e3;X3f0aee4a5;X40017beb6;X40ea1e186;X423e14cbd;X4b2436868;X4bca94e49;X51914a1fc;X57278d530;X58219c609;X6159a24e2;X63a653a8f;X65794841b;X6735bd890;X69f6e4ff2;X6b9aea454;X6ba2612ad;X6cff36603;X6e6adc70b;X6ebf5a13d;X7b8b1300d;X7d4763b66;X818d42899;X819f600f5;X8fd2f628f;X91aa2add2;X927936e4d;X928daeea3;X957ba0db5;X967a7dbd2;X9bb10791c;X9c4a8b758;X9f1ce7bbf;X9fa51bcf8;Xa0a604f4b;Xa5a33da71;Xa684393a7;Xac29dfb08;Xb205a2d5e;Xb2dc8e1a6;Xb2f9896e7;Xb36d43c16;Xba0c7d846;Xbe36ff108;Xbe6bfc79a;Xc5d9c04c1;Xd40b3fa09;Xd80cafdf3;Xdb350f703;Xe0d7ea1d7;Xe162f1313;Xe5fbd7662;Xeefd333cb;Xf0c60f9f6;Xf0cec6e61;Xf49ffe5ff;Xf75fdddb0;Xf858109af;Xffefc3366,72,Spoke Darts for Efficient High Dimensional Blue Noise Sampling,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1118,2014
230,"Surface parameterizations have been widely used in computer graphics and geometry processing. In particular, as simply-connected open surfaces are conformally equivalent to the unit disk, it is desirable to compute the disk conformal parameterizations of the surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for the conformal parameterization of a simply-connected open surface onto the unit disk, which significantly speeds up the computation, enhances the conformality and stability, and guarantees the bijectivity. The conformality distortions at the inner region and on the boundary are corrected by two steps, with the aid of an iterative scheme using quasi-conformal theories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","Choi, Pui Tung;Lui, Lok Ming",ArXiv e-prints,"[X009bd813e, X04cc667df, X0528c88b0, X063085dbf, X0917e91eb, X0b163b992, X0f4d390c6, X0fd1afd45, X133d66954, X149b02e31, X17e15e9c8, X18c328e62, X1aac63d7c, X1c7ba4ec8, X2630ad5e4, X289d1f860, X2942ef2c4, X2c4ad8843, X33d3b8da2, X379b34126, X3c2c25dbb, X3d314805c, X423e14cbd, X43548969f, X4606a6c9b, X4efc8d4cb, X5b61aab4c, X5df58509f, X6358adfcd, X69c004c14, X6e69708cf, X731f0f864, X749a2de29, X8151ac5b4, X8878f8386, X8a84c2dac, X919b69df6, X99b1ec51c, X9bdb63f21, X9ff0799e0, Xa3f0e8eba, Xa40178df1, Xa4759a50d, Xa9527f809, Xa971dbb69, Xabe9575ef, Xb1d038d2b, Xb5b3fb89e, Xb6303cd1d, Xbdba4f24a, Xc09b538c6, Xc24acd421, Xd0dc2d347, Xd50e5348e, Xdb861f293, Xe0a4c9309, Xe0da74d7c, Xe57890201, Xe5a0768d4, Xea17f32e8, Xeaffa06bb, Xf36c83166, Xfbb921a46, Xfc063f1ab, Xfc2037ffe, Xfe7fb6d71, Xfebf0b53c]",X009bd813e;X04cc667df;X0528c88b0;X063085dbf;X0917e91eb;X0b163b992;X0f4d390c6;X0fd1afd45;X133d66954;X149b02e31;X17e15e9c8;X18c328e62;X1aac63d7c;X1c7ba4ec8;X2630ad5e4;X289d1f860;X2942ef2c4;X2c4ad8843;X33d3b8da2;X379b34126;X3c2c25dbb;X3d314805c;X423e14cbd;X43548969f;X4606a6c9b;X4efc8d4cb;X5b61aab4c;X5df58509f;X6358adfcd;X69c004c14;X6e69708cf;X731f0f864;X749a2de29;X8151ac5b4;X8878f8386;X8a84c2dac;X919b69df6;X99b1ec51c;X9bdb63f21;X9ff0799e0;Xa3f0e8eba;Xa40178df1;Xa4759a50d;Xa9527f809;Xa971dbb69;Xabe9575ef;Xb1d038d2b;Xb5b3fb89e;Xb6303cd1d;Xbdba4f24a;Xc09b538c6;Xc24acd421;Xd0dc2d347;Xd50e5348e;Xdb861f293;Xe0a4c9309;Xe0da74d7c;Xe57890201;Xe5a0768d4;Xea17f32e8;Xeaffa06bb;Xf36c83166;Xfbb921a46;Xfc063f1ab;Xfc2037ffe;Xfe7fb6d71;Xfebf0b53c,67,Fast Disk Conformal Parameterization of Simply-connected Open Surfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6974,2014

233,"Continuous collision detection (CCD) and response methods are widely adopted in dynamics simulation of deformable models. They are history-based, as their success is strictly based on an assumption of a collision-free state at the start of each time interval. On the other hand, in many applications surfaces have normals defined to designate their orientation (i.e. front- and back-face), yet CCD methods are totally blind to such orientation identification (thus are orientation-free). We notice that if such information is utilized, many penetrations can be untangled. In this paper we present a history-free method for separation of two penetrating meshes, where at least one of them has clarified surface orientation. This method first computes all edge-face (E-F) intersections with discrete collision detection (DCD), and then builds a number of penetration stencils. On response, the stencil vertices are relocated into a penetration-free state, via a global displacement minimizer. Our method is very effective for handling penetration between two meshes, being it an initial configuration or in the middle of physics simulation. The major limitation is that it is not applicable to self-collision within one mesh at the time being.","Ye, Juntao",ArXiv e-prints,"[X04db90979, X0d36c94c8, X1f71a18cd, X434bab7b1, X4ef310d69, X580432831, X5ef0d58a5, X6a060dd10, X7967b748e, X7ddba8674, X9175f2200, X9d2976c44, Xa97bcee5f, Xb6d05959c, Xfe4f18eac]",X04db90979;X0d36c94c8;X1f71a18cd;X434bab7b1;X4ef310d69;X580432831;X5ef0d58a5;X6a060dd10;X7967b748e;X7ddba8674;X9175f2200;X9d2976c44;Xa97bcee5f;Xb6d05959c;Xfe4f18eac,15,History-free Collision Response for Deformable Surfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2081,2014
234,"The physical world consists of spatially varying media, such as the atmosphere and the ocean, in which light and sound propagates along non-linear trajectories. This presents a challenge to existing ray-tracing based methods, which are widely adopted to simulate propagation due to their efficiency and flexibility, but assume linear rays. We present a novel algorithm that traces analytic ray curves computed from local media gradients, and utilizes the closed-form solutions of both the intersections of the ray curves with planar surfaces, and the travel distance. By constructing an adaptive unstructured mesh, our algorithm is able to model general media profiles that vary in three dimensions with complex boundaries consisting of terrains and other scene objects such as buildings. We trace the analytic ray curves using the adaptive unstructured mesh, which considerably improves the efficiency over prior methods. We highlight the algorithm's application on simulation of sound and visual propagation in outdoor scenes.","Mo, Qi;Yeh, Hengchin;Manocha, Dinesh",ArXiv e-prints,"[X090faff1e, X14c432177, X16786bad0, X16b0f1d95, X17f2a5c6d, X236400304, X23e432a94, X2ad026de6, X3069483f5, X3a1b35a3b, X3ba310e52, X4499b9f2a, X5000b8d00, X59933a1e8, X655438422, X6904c1e7f, X6b7711c51, X784ce6d23, X901e7a1e6, X928daeea3, X963ead95b, X9f804dc46, Xa0b28e729, Xa3512147e, Xb029a92a0, Xb19fd9555, Xb1a52f661, Xb2ebc3a45, Xb9dd2ebc1, Xbdca63476, Xc75b90713, Xc948757cf, Xcbb499551, Xd5101620a, Xe1c3e260f, Xe22f47149, Xe4869c9d2, Xe5581e4e3, Xe9212cce4, Xf00ee7ec3, Xf6c2118d4, Xf844be639, Xf934c2f31]",X090faff1e;X14c432177;X16786bad0;X16b0f1d95;X17f2a5c6d;X236400304;X23e432a94;X2ad026de6;X3069483f5;X3a1b35a3b;X3ba310e52;X4499b9f2a;X5000b8d00;X59933a1e8;X655438422;X6904c1e7f;X6b7711c51;X784ce6d23;X901e7a1e6;X928daeea3;X963ead95b;X9f804dc46;Xa0b28e729;Xa3512147e;Xb029a92a0;Xb19fd9555;Xb1a52f661;Xb2ebc3a45;Xb9dd2ebc1;Xbdca63476;Xc75b90713;Xc948757cf;Xcbb499551;Xd5101620a;Xe1c3e260f;Xe22f47149;Xe4869c9d2;Xe5581e4e3;Xe9212cce4;Xf00ee7ec3;Xf6c2118d4;Xf844be639;Xf934c2f31,43,Tracing Analytic Ray Curves for Light and Sound Propagation in Non-linear Media,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2235,2014
235,"Informative and discriminative feature descriptors play a fundamental role in deformable shape analysis. For example, they have been successfully employed in correspondence, registration, and retrieval tasks. In the recent years, significant attention has been devoted to descriptors obtained from the spectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the shape. Notable examples in this family are the heat kernel signature (HKS) and the wave kernel signature (WKS). Laplacian-based descriptors achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerous shape analysis tasks; they are computationally efficient, isometry-invariant by construction, and can gracefully cope with a variety of transformations. In this paper, we formulate a generic family of parametric spectral descriptors. We argue that in order to be optimal for a specific task, the descriptor should take into account the statistics of the corpus of shapes to which it is applied (the ""signal"") and those of the class of transformations to which it is made insensitive (the ""noise""). While such statistics are hard to model axiomatically, they can be learned from examples. Following the spirit of the Wiener filter in signal processing, we show a learning scheme for the construction of optimal spectral descriptors and relate it to Mahalanobis metric learning. The superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the SHREC'10 benchmark.","Bronstein, Alexander M.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X07c1862d3, X0b467d7d7, X119b352e9, X1999ed165, X270c7c8cd, X30dfd8f06, X35073f676, X3be2e1970, X400893d60, X51183cd74, X55e4118d0, X5777f79ec, X583c6ac1d, X6ab4e099f, X6ad16120c, X6d5862d9a, X72936dbbd, X73ef787f8, X7d90c9768, X807fc0561, X8436ed371, X8bce7e8e8, X9df7f8951, Xa1d7ebdfe, Xa5919f569, Xa9b7a7294, Xbdd9ab76f, Xc022645f4, Xc85273883, Xc951e17c2, Xcf17123c5, Xd344010f2, Xd586b8b27, Xd87f1fe6a, Xdfa5d64b0, Xe003b9620, Xe18e6fcba, Xe2cfdbc7b, Xf0713d228, Xf4f5c2eaf, Xf78d25bf9, Xfa291a682, Xfa53f7843]",X07c1862d3;X0b467d7d7;X119b352e9;X1999ed165;X270c7c8cd;X30dfd8f06;X35073f676;X3be2e1970;X400893d60;X51183cd74;X55e4118d0;X5777f79ec;X583c6ac1d;X6ab4e099f;X6ad16120c;X6d5862d9a;X72936dbbd;X73ef787f8;X7d90c9768;X807fc0561;X8436ed371;X8bce7e8e8;X9df7f8951;Xa1d7ebdfe;Xa5919f569;Xa9b7a7294;Xbdd9ab76f;Xc022645f4;Xc85273883;Xc951e17c2;Xcf17123c5;Xd344010f2;Xd586b8b27;Xd87f1fe6a;Xdfa5d64b0;Xe003b9620;Xe18e6fcba;Xe2cfdbc7b;Xf0713d228;Xf4f5c2eaf;Xf78d25bf9;Xfa291a682;Xfa53f7843,43,Spectral descriptors for deformable shapes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5015,2011
236,"One of the big challenges of developing interactive statistical applications is the management of the data pipeline, which controls transformations from data to plot. The user's interactions needs to be propagated through these modules and reflected in the output representation at a fast pace. Each individual module may be easy to develop and manage, but the dependency structure can be quite challenging. The MVC (Model/View/Controller) pattern is an attempt to solve the problem by separating the user's interaction from the representation of the data. In this paper we discuss the paradigm of reactive programming in the framework of the MVC architecture and show its applicability to interactive graphics. Under this paradigm, developers benefit from the separation of user interaction from the graphical representation, which makes it easier for users and developers to extend interactive applications. We show the central role of reactive data objects in an interactive graphics system, implemented as the R package cranvas, which is freely available on GitHub and the main developers include the authors of this paper.","Xie, Yihui;Hofmann, Heike;Cheng, Xiaoyue",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0add13768, X0c33e51bc, X0d15509a7, X157bf8436, X16da53b7e, X1804c419e, X1bb135335, X1ef044487, X20361e537, X2a8f1d274, X2b2e49aa8, X3021e7381, X352167642, X44322c35a, X4ead207d3, X52f410b06, X53aadbeb1, X5582e1ff6, X5f3b9bc72, X60108910f, X6a4710582, X85d003696, X8adb695c4, X8befc7809, X8c820ff70, X8ea445200, X9946a2571, X9f9566c45, Xa52970ffe, Xa66484b69, Xa88b9681c, Xaa978bd74, Xb05ccdce2, Xb55bdb8db, Xbe341b156, Xce6ba0c4b, Xd05f923fb, Xd570486b4, Xd5acd02ae, Xda40cfb4e, Xdb4df7d73, Xe1cdcde0b, Xe324b5c52]",X0add13768;X0c33e51bc;X0d15509a7;X157bf8436;X16da53b7e;X1804c419e;X1bb135335;X1ef044487;X20361e537;X2a8f1d274;X2b2e49aa8;X3021e7381;X352167642;X44322c35a;X4ead207d3;X52f410b06;X53aadbeb1;X5582e1ff6;X5f3b9bc72;X60108910f;X6a4710582;X85d003696;X8adb695c4;X8befc7809;X8c820ff70;X8ea445200;X9946a2571;X9f9566c45;Xa52970ffe;Xa66484b69;Xa88b9681c;Xaa978bd74;Xb05ccdce2;Xb55bdb8db;Xbe341b156;Xce6ba0c4b;Xd05f923fb;Xd570486b4;Xd5acd02ae;Xda40cfb4e;Xdb4df7d73;Xe1cdcde0b;Xe324b5c52,43,Reactive Programming for Interactive Graphics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7256,2014
237,"The past two decades showed a rapid growing of physically-based modeling of fluids for computer graphics applications. In this area, a common top down approach is to model the fluid dynamics by Navier-Stokes equations and apply a numerical techniques such as Finite Differences or Finite Elements for the simulation. In this paper we focus on fluid modeling through Lattice Gas Cellular Automata (LGCA) for computer graphics applications. LGCA are discrete models based on point particles that move on a lattice, according to suitable and simple rules in order to mimic a fully molecular dynamics. By Chapman-Enskog expansion, a known multiscale technique in this area, it can be demonstrated that the Navier-Stokes model can be reproduced by the LGCA technique. Thus, with LGCA we get a fluid model that does not require solution of complicated equations. Therefore, we combine the advantage of the low computational cost of LGCA and its ability to mimic the realistic fluid dynamics to develop a new animating framework for computer graphics applications. In this work, we discuss the theoretical elements of our proposal and show experimental results.","Giraldi, Gilson A.;Xavier, Adilson V.;Apolinario, Antonio L., Jr;Rodrigues, Paulo S.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0f7b8da5c, X1a2154eed, X2ef0dfe1d, X34a6b6d51, X4c260374a, X5a066ed2c, X797607793, X79767fb76, X8e1c3c895, Xaa12fd15c, Xd9e60f451]",X0f7b8da5c;X1a2154eed;X2ef0dfe1d;X34a6b6d51;X4c260374a;X5a066ed2c;X797607793;X79767fb76;X8e1c3c895;Xaa12fd15c;Xd9e60f451,11,Lattice Gas Cellular Automata for Computational Fluid Animation,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0507012,2005
238,"Compression plays a significant role in a data storage and a transmission. If we speak about a generall data compression, it has to be a lossless one. It means, we are able to recover the original data 1:1 from the compressed file. Multimedia data (images, video, sound...), are a special case. In this area, we can use something called a lossy compression. Our main goal is not to recover data 1:1, but only keep them visually similar. This article is about an image compression, so we will be interested only in image compression. For a human eye, it is not a huge difference, if we recover RGB color with values [150,140,138] instead of original [151,140,137]. The magnitude of a difference determines the loss rate of the compression.

239,"The production of animation is a resource intensive process in game companies. Therefore, techniques to synthesize animations have been developed. However, these procedural techniques offer limited adaptability by animation artists. In order to solve this, a fuzzy neural network model of the animation is proposed, where the parameters can be tuned either by machine learning techniques that use motion capture data as training data or by the animation artist himself. This paper illustrates how this real time procedural animation system can be developed, taking the human gait on flat terrain and inclined surfaces as example. Currently, the parametric model is capable of synthesizing animations for various limb sizes and step sizes.","Samyn, Koen;Van Hoecke, Sofie;Pieters, Bart;Hollemeersch, Charles;Demeulemeester, Aljosha;van de Walle, Rik",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01a48698b, X29701a470, X29bb2c431, X329a71c55, X38575e34c, X3f5dc6394, X417c9d48c, X51b14d0e7, X5534540f2, X56b9b634d, X6233c54f6, X63f83d9cd, X7753701dd, X809870698, X85f885e96, X8d276bb7c, X937e6405f, Xb6f2acfad, Xb995655d1, Xb9a21d22a, Xc2d7ff36c, Xc778af4a8, Xc9ab2e984, Xce9f960e7, Xd1cd0d03a, Xd80b8dd28, Xdad515d6c, Xdf90f315f, Xe476829e5, Xeb5af2217, Xf7a6740a1]",X01a48698b;X29701a470;X29bb2c431;X329a71c55;X38575e34c;X3f5dc6394;X417c9d48c;X51b14d0e7;X5534540f2;X56b9b634d;X6233c54f6;X63f83d9cd;X7753701dd;X809870698;X85f885e96;X8d276bb7c;X937e6405f;Xb6f2acfad;Xb995655d1;Xb9a21d22a;Xc2d7ff36c;Xc778af4a8;Xc9ab2e984;Xce9f960e7;Xd1cd0d03a;Xd80b8dd28;Xdad515d6c;Xdf90f315f;Xe476829e5;Xeb5af2217;Xf7a6740a1,31,Real-time animation of human characters with fuzzy controllers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1130,2014

Coupling is directly linked with other dimensions, such as co-presence, engagement, and believability, and was measured in an experiment that allowed users to describe their subjective feelings about those dimensions of interest. The experiment was based on a theatrical game involving the imitation of slow upper-body movements and the proposal of new movements by the user and virtual agent. The agent's behaviour varied in autonomy: the agent could limit itself to imitating the user's movements only, initiate new movements, or combine both behaviours. After the game, each participant completed a questionnaire regarding their engagement in the interaction, their subjective feeling about the co-presence of the agent, etc. Based on four main dimensions of interest, we tested several hypotheses against our experimental results, which are discussed here.","Bevacqua, Elisabetta;Igor, Sankovic;Ayoub, Maatalaoui;Nédélec, A.;De Loor, Pierre",ArXiv e-prints,"[X28cdfe5b8, X2c6e42bac, X2ccb8be2a, X3d807cb1b, X3ffc416b0, X54f286f87, X5baea2fe6, X6918db166, X696daaa44, X78d6c882d, X82e6c78df, X967f04c7d, X9ae6eefa5, Xba6f9bb0f, Xbd946f5ad, Xc94ff749b, Xd7c13c718, Xea4c344df, Xecd4fa3e7]",X28cdfe5b8;X2c6e42bac;X2ccb8be2a;X3d807cb1b;X3ffc416b0;X54f286f87;X5baea2fe6;X6918db166;X696daaa44;X78d6c882d;X82e6c78df;X967f04c7d;X9ae6eefa5;Xba6f9bb0f;Xbd946f5ad;Xc94ff749b;Xd7c13c718;Xea4c344df;Xecd4fa3e7,19,Effects of Coupling in Human-Virtual Agent Body Interaction,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5758,2014
242,"We present some notes on the definition of mathematical design as well as on the methods of mathematical modeling which are used in the process of the artistic design of the environment and its components. For the first time in the field of geometric modeling, we perform an aesthetic analysis of planar Bernstein-Bezier curves from the standpoint of the laws of technical aesthetics. The shape features of the curve segments' geometry were evaluated using the following criteria: conciseness-integrity, expressiveness, proportional consistency, compositional balance, structural organization, imagery, rationality, dynamism, scale, flexibility and harmony. In the non-Russian literature, Bernstein-Bezier curves using a monotonic curvature function (i.e., a class A Bezier curve) are considered to be fair (i.e., beautiful) curves, but their aesthetic analysis has never been performed. The aesthetic analysis performed by the authors of this work means that this is no longer the case. To confirm the conclusions of the authors' research, a survey of the ""aesthetic appropriateness"" of certain Bernstein-Bezier curve segments was conducted among 240 children, aged 14-17.

243,"Calculating and categorizing the similarity of curves is a fundamental problem which has generated much recent interest. However, to date there are no implementations of these algorithms for curves on surfaces with provable guarantees on the quality of the measure. In this paper, we present a similarity measure for any two cycles that are homologous, where we calculate the minimum area of any homology (or connected bounding chain) between the two cycles. The minimum area homology exists for broader classes of cycles than previous measures which are based on homotopy. It is also much easier to compute than previously defined measures, yielding an efficient implementation that is based on linear algebra tools. We demonstrate our algorithm on a range of inputs, showing examples which highlight the feasibility of this similarity measure.","Chambers, Erin Wolf;Vejdemo-Johansson, Mikael",ArXiv e-prints,"[X063504b0d, X09f9b38b1, X17edc4de4, X199c1c616, X27903eb40, X3542b53c4, X35ad46602, X37c178551, X388bf25bd, X4b619f9bd, X5690778fe, X676d5e2fb, X6b8ef816f, X6e38f7fc9, X7813dd121, X7ce82556a, X8d6500513, X976597aff, X9b2b27f68, Xa7e503bb3, Xadd186c9c, Xb05ccdce2, Xc2fff1b33, Xc61e47387, Xcce62715c, Xd05d36e63, Xd1409f631, Xd37773da3, Xd4a62a985, Xdea0fadbb, Xdea445598, Xeff0aa2d8, Xf05038b46, Xfe1fe9917]",X063504b0d;X09f9b38b1;X17edc4de4;X199c1c616;X27903eb40;X3542b53c4;X35ad46602;X37c178551;X388bf25bd;X4b619f9bd;X5690778fe;X676d5e2fb;X6b8ef816f;X6e38f7fc9;X7813dd121;X7ce82556a;X8d6500513;X976597aff;X9b2b27f68;Xa7e503bb3;Xadd186c9c;Xb05ccdce2;Xc2fff1b33;Xc61e47387;Xcce62715c;Xd05d36e63;Xd1409f631;Xd37773da3;Xd4a62a985;Xdea0fadbb;Xdea445598;Xeff0aa2d8;Xf05038b46;Xfe1fe9917,34,Computing minimum area homologies,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2320,2014
244,"Finding nearly accurate distance between two or more nearly intersecting three-dimensional (3D) objects is vital especially for collision determination such as in virtual surgeon simulation and real-time car crash simulation. Instead of performing broad phase collision detection, we need to check for accuracy of detection by running narrow phase collision detection. One of the important elements for narrow phase collision detection is to determine the precise distance between two or more nearly intersecting objects or polygons in order to prepare the area for potential colliding. Distance computation plays important roles in determine the exact point of contact between two or more nearly intersecting polygons where the preparation for collision detection is determined at the earlier stage. In this paper, we describes our current works of determining the distance between objects using dynamic pivot point that will be used as reference point to reduce the complexity searching for potential point of contacts. By using Axis-Aligned Bounding Box for each polygon, we calculate a dynamic pivot point that will become our reference point to determine the potential candidates for distance computation. The test our finding distance will be simplified by using our method instead of performing unneeded operations. Our method provides faster solution than the previous method where it helps to determine the point of contact efficiently and faster than the other method.","Asyrani Sulaiman, Hamzah;Bade, Abdullah;Harun Abdullah, Mohd",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0036c6b3b, X36ea38308, X3b4ab5cb6, X3e4c95cdd, X4a2570783, X50743206e, X5a195583c, X6152db347, X67d347e9d, X6cc84b150, X786905166, X7ddcb9c34, X91f5d2dae, Xa61adadae, Xad9a38c91, Xb0bb8773b, Xb0f7a5731, Xd83493cf5, Xdeae3c806, Xfc4729e72, Xfccd80d9f]",X0036c6b3b;X36ea38308;X3b4ab5cb6;X3e4c95cdd;X4a2570783;X50743206e;X5a195583c;X6152db347;X67d347e9d;X6cc84b150;X786905166;X7ddcb9c34;X91f5d2dae;Xa61adadae;Xad9a38c91;Xb0bb8773b;Xb0f7a5731;Xd83493cf5;Xdeae3c806;Xfc4729e72;Xfccd80d9f,21,Efficient Distance Computation Algorithm between Nearly Intersected Objects Using Dynamic Pivot Point in Virtual Environment Application,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4603,2014

248,"The three-dimensional geometry and connectivity of pore space determines the flow of single-phase incompressible flow. Herein I report on new throat finding algorithms that contribute to finding the exact flow-relevant geometrical properties of the void space, including high porosity samples of X2B images, three-dimensional synchrotron X-ray computed microtomographic images, and amounting to over 20% porosity. These new algorithms use the modified medial axis that comes from the 3DMA-Rock software package. To find accurate throats, we classify three major throat types: mostly planar and simply connected type, non-planar and simply connected type, and non-planar and non-simply connected type. For each type, we make at least one algorithm to find the throats. Here I introduce an example that has a non-planar and simply connected throat, and my solution indicated by one of my algorithms. My five algorithms each calculate the throat for each path. It selects one of them, which has the smallest inner area. New algorithms find accurate throats at least 98% among 12 high porosity samples (over 20%). Also, I introduce a new length calculation in the digitized image.

251,"Von Neuman's work on universal machines and the hardware development have allowed the simulation of dynamical systems through a large set of interacting agents. This is a bottom-up approach which tries to derive global properties of a complex system through local interaction rules and agent behaviour. Traditionally, such systems are modeled and simulated through top-down methods based on differential equations. Agent-Based Modeling has the advantage of simplicity and low computational cost. However, unlike differential equations, there is no standard way to express agent behaviour. Besides, it is not clear how to analytically predict the results obtained by the simulation. In this paper we survey some of these methods. For expressing agent behaviour formal methods, like Stochastic Process Algebras have been used. Such approach is useful if the global properties of interest can be expressed as a function of stochastic time series. However, if space variables must be considered, we shall change the focus. In this case, multiscale techniques, based on Chapman-Enskog expansion, was used to establish the connection between the microscopic dynamics and the macroscopic observables. Also, we use data mining techniques,like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to study agent systems like Cellular Automata. With the help of these tools we will discuss a simple society model, a Lattice Gas Automaton for fluid modeling, and knowledge discovery in CA databases. Besides, we show the capabilities of the NetLogo, a software for agent simulation of complex system and show our experience about.","Giraldi, Gilson A.;da Costa, Luis C.;Xavier, Adilson V.;Rodrigues, Paulo S.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X28e5f2298, X399a0275a, Xac588df1a, Xbd4eb51b3, Xec526bd20]",X28e5f2298;X399a0275a;Xac588df1a;Xbd4eb51b3;Xec526bd20,5,Methods for Analytical Understanding of Agent-Based Modeling of Complex Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0508002,2005
252,"One of the most efficient ways of generating goal-directed walking motions is synthesising the final motion based on footprints. Nevertheless, current implementations have not examined the generation of continuous motion based on footprints, where different behaviours can be generated automatically. Therefore, in this paper a flexible approach for footprint-driven locomotion composition is presented. The presented solution is based on the ability to generate footprint-driven locomotion, with flexible features like jumping, running, and stair stepping. In addition, the presented system examines the ability of generating the desired motion of the character based on predefined footprint patterns that determine which behaviour should be performed. Finally, it is examined the generation of transition patterns based on the velocity of the root and the number of footsteps required to achieve the target behaviour smoothly and naturally.","Mousas, Christos;Newbury, Paul;Anagnostopoulos, Christos-Nikolaos",ArXiv e-prints,"[X154b194e7, X216f9ab5d, Xb4de4242d, Xcbbf5a9d7, Xd21c05503, Xdb7e11ef1, Xf4d7d41dd, Xf7b8af5c9]",X154b194e7;X216f9ab5d;Xb4de4242d;Xcbbf5a9d7;Xd21c05503;Xdb7e11ef1;Xf4d7d41dd;Xf7b8af5c9,8,Footprint-Driven Locomotion Composition,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1906,2014

In this work, we propose a novel data-driven reforming (i.e., reshaping) algorithm that adapts an input multi-component model for a target fabrication material. The algorithm adapts both the part geometry and the inter-part topology of the input shape to better align with material specific fabrication requirements. As output, we produce the reshaped model along with respective part dimensions and inter-part junction specifications. We evaluate our algorithm on a range of man-made models and demonstrate non-trivial model reshaping examples focusing only on metal and wooden materials.

255,"Bundle adjustment (BA) is the problem of refining a visual reconstruction to produce better structure and viewing parameter estimates. This problem is often formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem, where data arises from interest point matching. Mismatched interest points cause serious problems in this approach, as a single mismatch will affect the entire reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel robust Student's t BA algorithm (RST-BA). We model reprojection errors using the heavy tailed Student's t-distribution, and use an implicit trust region method to compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the camera and viewing parameters in this model. The resulting algorithm exploits the sparse structure essential for reconstructing multi-image scenarios, has the same time complexity as standard L2 bundle adjustment (L2-BA), and can be implemented with minimal changes to the standard least squares framework. We show that the RST-BA is more accurate than either L2-BA or L2-BA with a sigma-edit rule for outlier removal for a range of simulated error generation scenarios. The new method has also been used to reconstruct lunar topography using data from the NASA Apollo 15 orbiter, and we present visual and quantitative comparisons of RST-BA and L2-BA methods for this application. In particular, using the RST-BA algorithm we were able to reconstruct a DEM from unprocessed data with many outliers and no ground control points, which was not possible with the L2-BA method.","Aravkin, Aleksandr Y.;Styer, Michael;Moratto, Zachary;Nefian, Ara;Broxton, Michael",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01e8c2573, X0dd16f4b2, X10252a24c, X137794a5d, X2817bee81, X28ba81979, X403df0f7d, X439f9fbe5, X4bef0cd1a, X62445b6cb, X6b7c90a2f, X7018422d6, X78b106074, X83a1ebcfc, X884d7c3c8, X8cfb1f02f, X9044459f9, X99ccf56bd, Xa58aba2f9, Xab682dcf8, Xba82075da, Xc003275e5, Xc1d1be66c, Xc27dc3ea7, Xc59a09b7f, Xd0e98e7ff, Xd2a41a3dd, Xdb4799a07, Xe4e421cbf, Xeda7cb36b, Xefa99e201, Xfa96f6ec1, Xfdabd9d8b, Xfe97567ac, Xff4f16b69]",X01e8c2573;X0dd16f4b2;X10252a24c;X137794a5d;X2817bee81;X28ba81979;X403df0f7d;X439f9fbe5;X4bef0cd1a;X62445b6cb;X6b7c90a2f;X7018422d6;X78b106074;X83a1ebcfc;X884d7c3c8;X8cfb1f02f;X9044459f9;X99ccf56bd;Xa58aba2f9;Xab682dcf8;Xba82075da;Xc003275e5;Xc1d1be66c;Xc27dc3ea7;Xc59a09b7f;Xd0e98e7ff;Xd2a41a3dd;Xdb4799a07;Xe4e421cbf;Xeda7cb36b;Xefa99e201;Xfa96f6ec1;Xfdabd9d8b;Xfe97567ac;Xff4f16b69,35,Student's T Robust Bundle Adjustment Algorithm,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1400,2011
256,"A fundamental challenge to sensory processing tasks in perception and robotics is the problem of obtaining data associations across views. We present a robust solution for ascertaining potentially dense surface patch (superpixel) associations, requiring just range information. Our approach involves decomposition of a view into regularized surface patches. We represent them as sequences expressing geometry invariantly over their superpixel neighborhoods, as uniquely consistent partial orderings. We match these representations through an optimal sequence comparison metric based on the Damerau-Levenshtein distance - enabling robust association with quadratic complexity (in contrast to hitherto employed joint matching formulations which are NP-complete). The approach is able to perform under wide baselines, heavy rotations, partial overlaps, significant occlusions and sensor noise. The technique does not require any priors -- motion or otherwise, and does not make restrictive assumptions on scene structure and sensor movement. It does not require appearance -- is hence more widely applicable than appearance reliant methods, and invulnerable to related ambiguities such as textureless or aliased content. We present promising qualitative and quantitative results under diverse settings, along with comparatives with popular approaches based on range as well as RGB-D data.","Sawhney, Rahul;Li, Fuxin;Christensen, Henrik I.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X009371c68, X00fa7a190, X06773d5a5, X0ee7edd95, X13ec37f49, X158f4115a, X1c7328b04, X1cce0d849, X2af584cba, X31c77ae99, X3b5fcaa6c, X3d2b12027, X4cf7ccf66, X5185f958a, X57372996e, X5b381b24a, X629f20d03, X6479a0fff, X701efaad8, X7b335b94c, X7b383985c, X859a70e14, X869109276, X90e5294eb, X96f2e38b3, X99865a139, Xa6bf5a693, Xa7c8d9db6, Xaa8a0fcd4, Xb11182df3, Xc0f04e894, Xc1ecb16b9, Xc59a09b7f, Xcc7b1f088, Xdc307324f, Xe676c2b33, Xec325b394, Xec64f4938, Xef3800e08, Xf3f1a8427, Xffa0deafb]",X009371c68;X00fa7a190;X06773d5a5;X0ee7edd95;X13ec37f49;X158f4115a;X1c7328b04;X1cce0d849;X2af584cba;X31c77ae99;X3b5fcaa6c;X3d2b12027;X4cf7ccf66;X5185f958a;X57372996e;X5b381b24a;X629f20d03;X6479a0fff;X701efaad8;X7b335b94c;X7b383985c;X859a70e14;X869109276;X90e5294eb;X96f2e38b3;X99865a139;Xa6bf5a693;Xa7c8d9db6;Xaa8a0fcd4;Xb11182df3;Xc0f04e894;Xc1ecb16b9;Xc59a09b7f;Xcc7b1f088;Xdc307324f;Xe676c2b33;Xec325b394;Xec64f4938;Xef3800e08;Xf3f1a8427;Xffa0deafb,41,GASP : Geometric Association with Surface Patches,http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4098,2014
257,"This paper presents an application of photogrammetry on ceramic fragments from two excavation sites located north-west of France. The restitution by photogrammetry of these different fragments allowed reconstructions of the potteries in their original state or at least to get to as close as possible. We used the 3D reconstructions to compute some metrics and to generate a presentation support by using a 3D printer. This work is based on affordable tools and illustrates how 3D technologies can be quite easily integrated in archaeology process with limited financial resources. 1. INTRODUCTION Today, photogrammetry and 3D modelling are an integral part of the methods used in archeology and heritage management. They provide answers to scientific needs in the fields of conservation, preservation, restoration and mediation of architectural, archaeological and cultural heritage [2] [6] [7] [9]. Photogrammetry on ceramic fragments was one of the first applications contemporary of the development of this technique applied in the archaeological community [3]. More recently and due to its democratization, it was applied more generally to artifacts [5]. Finally joined today by the rise of 3D printing [8] [10], it can restore fragmented artifacts [1] [12]. These examples target one or several particular objects and use different types of equipment that can be expensive. These aspects can put off uninitiated archaeologists. So it would be appropriate to see if these techniques could be generalized to a whole class of geometrically simple and common artifacts, such as ceramics. From these observations, associated to ceramics specialists with fragments of broken ceramics, we aimed at arranging different tools and methods, including photogrammetry, to explore opportunities for a cheap and attainable reconstruction methodology and its possible applications. Our first objective was to establish a protocol for scanning fragments with photogrammetry, and for reconstruction of original ceramics. We used the digital reconstitutions of the ceramics we got following our process to calculate some metrics and to design and 3D print a display for the remaining fragments of one pottery.","Barreau, Jean-Baptiste;Nicolas, Théophane;Bruniaux, G;Petit, E;Petit, Q;Bernard, Y;Gaugne, Ronan;Gouranton, Valérie",ArXiv e-prints,"[X11e831fac, X15836fda1, X163d0e064, X164d316ac, X20c710870, X2420c9ea3, X29735333b, X3a7e0db5f, X3cbc48c8e, X400230a2a, X40bbf395a, X44c49740a, X47734fe24, X4e964cbbd, X500c9a83e, X5d402129f, X6195adf31, X61b7772d6, X62f339c21, X65302b60a, X69cdc8fbe, X71ecf47b8, X77a73fe8a, X7f37d8cd1, X82ade9b74, X84aa7b5b6, X88828e785, X91186a31d, X92bab9631, X95ff632aa, X97ffc008c, X9b5e22262, Xaa7a74b55, Xaa85e84d0, Xb2509e445, Xbca35dc64, Xc2aba7ab9, Xc5a980234, Xc65e7128b, Xcd7ebcb02, Xd14c14987, Xd25a7073b, Xd594eea52, Xd5aa2281c, Xd746cb651, Xf06369706, Xf08d95225, Xf3bdfba8d, Xf5460ddbe]",X11e831fac;X15836fda1;X163d0e064;X164d316ac;X20c710870;X2420c9ea3;X29735333b;X3a7e0db5f;X3cbc48c8e;X400230a2a;X40bbf395a;X44c49740a;X47734fe24;X4e964cbbd;X500c9a83e;X5d402129f;X6195adf31;X61b7772d6;X62f339c21;X65302b60a;X69cdc8fbe;X71ecf47b8;X77a73fe8a;X7f37d8cd1;X82ade9b74;X84aa7b5b6;X88828e785;X91186a31d;X92bab9631;X95ff632aa;X97ffc008c;X9b5e22262;Xaa7a74b55;Xaa85e84d0;Xb2509e445;Xbca35dc64;Xc2aba7ab9;Xc5a980234;Xc65e7128b;Xcd7ebcb02;Xd14c14987;Xd25a7073b;Xd594eea52;Xd5aa2281c;Xd746cb651;Xf06369706;Xf08d95225;Xf3bdfba8d;Xf5460ddbe,49,"Ceramics Fragments Digitization by Photogrammetry, Reconstructions and Applications",http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1330,2014

We fill this gap with BigDataViewer, a Fiji plugin to interactively navigate and visualize large image sequences from both local and remote data sources.","Pietzsch, Tobias;Saalfeld, Stephan;Preibisch, Stephan;Tomancak, Pavel",ArXiv e-prints,"[X053952405, X057bdf742, X0737d8b93, X0843ddabd, X0a3c61378, X0fdb034d7, X1006853be, X178559edb, X1e3a4182d, X1f922a8af, X209fb4e73, X20c4bc680, X21dbec57f, X254aea8ed, X2552ef753, X2889f14d3, X2a5e149d8, X2fb8b003d, X31fdf1e2e, X342dece13, X348ec06af, X36988a5ab, X40bc5ad9d, X446078991, X4685c8146, X479df81f5, X4fb6f6fa5, X50b17cbec, X53e066a07, X5454b93a5, X55517b528, X571bf46ee, X5ab0ca556, X5b3e30bbe, X5f796766a, X611666b69, X65ca64650, X66a4accbd, X6707e6f1b, X676b2ae19, X67a046bfd, X6ce3d1400, X6fb16e3d1, X6fc6944d8, X702380336, X7314fa64f, X7479594a1, X8022e5a29, X823a7e45d, X8305acaf6, X85aa807fd, X8ac3f7e88, X8ea92c706, X8faf4e6b7, X90369c7eb, X9067f10ff, X933b1aaa4, X94b356a12, X952675b86, X9685a5ba5, X9d27e40b4, X9dfc983e9, Xa64b47040, Xa83464d47, Xa87302ca2, Xb333fa417, Xb800fa429, Xbef460044, Xc144c749a, Xc52a39115, Xc57e008cf, Xc583c14a2, Xc6f7d8423, Xc782a5486, Xc7c5c6d5b, Xcccd2f6ae, Xce70142d9, Xd2e608d80, Xd4d38abfa, Xd559971b7, Xd71cfefe3, Xdb2390c41, Xdfd66cafe, Xe1d034a5a, Xe8b81fbda, Xf11537601, Xf25f2a8ad, Xf5189becc, Xf52d48083, Xfa402a2d1, Xfce3c3b5c, Xfd2f40160, Xfd6ac718f, Xff3bdb73f, Xffea22d1e]",X053952405;X057bdf742;X0737d8b93;X0843ddabd;X0a3c61378;X0fdb034d7;X1006853be;X178559edb;X1e3a4182d;X1f922a8af;X209fb4e73;X20c4bc680;X21dbec57f;X254aea8ed;X2552ef753;X2889f14d3;X2a5e149d8;X2fb8b003d;X31fdf1e2e;X342dece13;X348ec06af;X36988a5ab;X40bc5ad9d;X446078991;X4685c8146;X479df81f5;X4fb6f6fa5;X50b17cbec;X53e066a07;X5454b93a5;X55517b528;X571bf46ee;X5ab0ca556;X5b3e30bbe;X5f796766a;X611666b69;X65ca64650;X66a4accbd;X6707e6f1b;X676b2ae19;X67a046bfd;X6ce3d1400;X6fb16e3d1;X6fc6944d8;X702380336;X7314fa64f;X7479594a1;X8022e5a29;X823a7e45d;X8305acaf6;X85aa807fd;X8ac3f7e88;X8ea92c706;X8faf4e6b7;X90369c7eb;X9067f10ff;X933b1aaa4;X94b356a12;X952675b86;X9685a5ba5;X9d27e40b4;X9dfc983e9;Xa64b47040;Xa83464d47;Xa87302ca2;Xb333fa417;Xb800fa429;Xbef460044;Xc144c749a;Xc52a39115;Xc57e008cf;Xc583c14a2;Xc6f7d8423;Xc782a5486;Xc7c5c6d5b;Xcccd2f6ae;Xce70142d9;Xd2e608d80;Xd4d38abfa;Xd559971b7;Xd71cfefe3;Xdb2390c41;Xdfd66cafe;Xe1d034a5a;Xe8b81fbda;Xf11537601;Xf25f2a8ad;Xf5189becc;Xf52d48083;Xfa402a2d1;Xfce3c3b5c;Xfd2f40160;Xfd6ac718f;Xff3bdb73f;Xffea22d1e,95,BigDataViewer: Interactive Visualization and Image Processing for Terabyte Data Sets,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0488,2014

260,"We introduce linear-state dataflows, a canonical model for a large set of visualization algorithms that we call data-linear visualizations. Our model defines a fixed dataflow architecture: partitioning and subpartitioning of input data, ordering, graphic primitives, and graphic attributes generation. Local variables and accumulators are specific concepts that extend the expressiveness of the dataflow to support features of visualization algorithms that require state handling. We first show the flexibility of our model: it enables the declarative construction of many common algorithms with just a few mappings. Furthermore, the model enables easy mixing of visual mappings, such as creating treemaps of histograms and 2D plots, plots of histograms... Finally, we introduce our model in a more formal way and present some of its important properties. We have implemented this model in a visualization framework built around the concept of linear-state dataflows.","Baudel, Thomas",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0da30c98f, X109eadad2, X22c1de99a, X271fc5b49, X2c514aa59, X2cfda44ad, X3b2cb10d5, X4974bca57, X55bf7cfc9, X5ceb45517, X71a2bb107, X75c2f6df2, X8b5ead4f8, X9138f89ff, Xa159b5b19, Xa839a9ea8, Xbdb759e3f, Xe1b387cff, Xec0589dbf, Xf088c55c6, Xf7ca0d8f0, Xfee49fa0f]",X0da30c98f;X109eadad2;X22c1de99a;X271fc5b49;X2c514aa59;X2cfda44ad;X3b2cb10d5;X4974bca57;X55bf7cfc9;X5ceb45517;X71a2bb107;X75c2f6df2;X8b5ead4f8;X9138f89ff;Xa159b5b19;Xa839a9ea8;Xbdb759e3f;Xe1b387cff;Xec0589dbf;Xf088c55c6;Xf7ca0d8f0;Xfee49fa0f,22,A Canonical Representation of Data-Linear Visualization Algorithms,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4246,2014

In this paper, a visual analysis system is developed to interactively identify and explore the evolution histories of thousands of halos. In this system, an intelligent structure-aware selection method in What You See Is What You Get manner is designed to efficiently define the interesting region in 3D space with 2D hand-drawn lasso input. Then the exact information of halos within this 3D region is identified by data mining in the merger tree files. To avoid visual clutter, all the halos are projected in 2D space with a MDS method. Through the linked view of 3D View and 2D graph, Users can interactively explore these halos, including the tracing path and evolution history tree.","Shan, Guihua;Xie, Maojin;Li, FengAn;Gao, Yang;Chi, Xuebin",ArXiv e-prints,"[X20e20e8d0, X211feb3c4, X2849c3265, X324aae21a, X34f03c14d, X3706e2a41, X406b49eaa, X42235b1dd, X59f52c084, X8320889b8, X90bbc1384, X9282c961a, Xb05ccdce2, Xc0acc2d29, Xd00d9a25b, Xdc815a661, Xdd2912488, Xe7004bc8f, Xf498164a6, Xf7d663ab7]",X20e20e8d0;X211feb3c4;X2849c3265;X324aae21a;X34f03c14d;X3706e2a41;X406b49eaa;X42235b1dd;X59f52c084;X8320889b8;X90bbc1384;X9282c961a;Xb05ccdce2;Xc0acc2d29;Xd00d9a25b;Xdc815a661;Xdd2912488;Xe7004bc8f;Xf498164a6;Xf7d663ab7,20,Interactive Visual Exploration of Halos in Large Scale Cosmology Simulation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7780,2014

However, both of these classical techniques have significant drawbacks, so a new approach, Storyline Visualization of Events on a Network (SVEN) is proposed. SVEN builds on storyline techniques, conveying nodes as contiguous lines over time. SVEN encodes time in a natural manner, along the horizontal axis, and optimizes the vertical placement of storylines to decrease clutter (line crossings, straightness, and bends) in the drawing. This paper demonstrates SVEN on several different flavors of real-world dynamic data, and outlines the remaining near-term future work.","Arendt, Dustin L.;Blaha, Leslie M.",ArXiv e-prints,"[4d2b68857c, X0843ddabd, X0eff2e406, X1027ce911, X3184fd318, X333a51978, X34c1c9989, X367132201, X3aea184a3, X3f45e9c91, X4157879bd, X4827fffc2, X48a8126e2, X4ab040308, X5461114d3, X5e5bdf93c, X5ead1919c, X64ab88703, X64d85b56d, X65b54efab, X688917920, X7279a9d52, X73c862925, X79d492557, X7a1edba03, X7fac96a86, X8345949f2, X8e0bda5b1, X913a3f2d6, X945fc013b, X96d2bb012, X9897e4ea5, X992e4a4c0, X99d9feaad, Xa71b6c120, Xa8529ff5d, Xab8988212, Xb7d0fc6b5, Xc61bb96c4, Xc8221ad79, Xcab0def86, Xeb18b1b55, Xeb3298c5e, Xf92c7a671]",4d2b68857c;X0843ddabd;X0eff2e406;X1027ce911;X3184fd318;X333a51978;X34c1c9989;X367132201;X3aea184a3;X3f45e9c91;X4157879bd;X4827fffc2;X48a8126e2;X4ab040308;X5461114d3;X5e5bdf93c;X5ead1919c;X64ab88703;X64d85b56d;X65b54efab;X688917920;X7279a9d52;X73c862925;X79d492557;X7a1edba03;X7fac96a86;X8345949f2;X8e0bda5b1;X913a3f2d6;X945fc013b;X96d2bb012;X9897e4ea5;X992e4a4c0;X99d9feaad;Xa71b6c120;Xa8529ff5d;Xab8988212;Xb7d0fc6b5;Xc61bb96c4;Xc8221ad79;Xcab0def86;Xeb18b1b55;Xeb3298c5e;Xf92c7a671,44,SVEN: Informative Visual Representation of Complex Dynamic Structure,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6706,2014

The proposed algorithm has been compared with conventional histogram equalization and the visual and quantitative experimental results are showing that the proposed method over perform the histogram equalization.,"Anbarjafari, Gholamreza",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00be4cde4, X00eed5396, X023eb33a5, X0a370529c, X1184c47c0, X15b3be402, X2849c3265, X2cd4c8737, X2ed1220df, X31f152ec3, X34a89c37d, X36fb97a09, X436d765c7, X4370b788c, X45de3f113, X4866dc3ec, X4cf029eed, X4f98fa5b2, X57228d55f, X5b5927aa4, X5d0fd54b4, X5eec86116, X5f4fc3ba4, X6c21bc36e, X6d371cfa2, X6e0e90622, X7950021ff, X7e6b25eda, X8ad38b32d, X8b4cb16f3, X9238103de, Xa00524190, Xa8090cab2, Xb07089049, Xbba2dcd71, Xbd785a5e0, Xc01e624af, Xc20d562d1, Xda8bd09b5, Xdccd3e90a, Xe6acdb16f, Xef90ff9ec, Xfccc4cf67, Xfd0ab0051]",X00be4cde4;X00eed5396;X023eb33a5;X0a370529c;X1184c47c0;X15b3be402;X2849c3265;X2cd4c8737;X2ed1220df;X31f152ec3;X34a89c37d;X36fb97a09;X436d765c7;X4370b788c;X45de3f113;X4866dc3ec;X4cf029eed;X4f98fa5b2;X57228d55f;X5b5927aa4;X5d0fd54b4;X5eec86116;X5f4fc3ba4;X6c21bc36e;X6d371cfa2;X6e0e90622;X7950021ff;X7e6b25eda;X8ad38b32d;X8b4cb16f3;X9238103de;Xa00524190;Xa8090cab2;Xb07089049;Xbba2dcd71;Xbd785a5e0;Xc01e624af;Xc20d562d1;Xda8bd09b5;Xdccd3e90a;Xe6acdb16f;Xef90ff9ec;Xfccc4cf67;Xfd0ab0051,44,HSI based colour image equalization using iterative nth root and nth power,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00108,2015
268,"We present a new approach to the problem of $G^{k,l}$-constrained ($k,l \leq 3$) multi-degree reduction of B\'{e}zier curves with respect to the least squares norm. First, to minimize the least squares error, we consider two methods of determining the values of geometric continuity parameters. One of them is based on quadratic and nonlinear programming, while the other uses some simplifying assumptions and solves a system of linear equations. Next, for prescribed values of these parameters, we obtain control points of the multi-degree reduced curve, using the properties of constrained dual Bernstein basis polynomials. Assuming that the input and output curves are of degree $n$ and $m$, respectively, we determine these points with the complexity $O(mn)$, which is significantly less than the cost of other known methods. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.","Gospodarczyk, Przemysław;Lewanowicz, Stanisław;Woźny, Paweł",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0697c9952, X08614c717, X0ede2ba2d, X1181649e5, X16d229f2c, X2b43b9966, X2b54bcc96, X2b5aed85d, X435b0b766, X49d6477c3, X4dd7f6302, X55974b666, X5c8fe456a, X6588090ac, X7950021ff, X7e56068bf, X8320889b8, X899b6d40a, X928daeea3, X9ac955769, X9e590c933, Xa839a9ea8, Xcbeebaf66, Xd45fe2f8b, Xd7d26591e, Xe47525a5f, Xef228215f, Xf498164a6]",X0697c9952;X08614c717;X0ede2ba2d;X1181649e5;X16d229f2c;X2b43b9966;X2b54bcc96;X2b5aed85d;X435b0b766;X49d6477c3;X4dd7f6302;X55974b666;X5c8fe456a;X6588090ac;X7950021ff;X7e56068bf;X8320889b8;X899b6d40a;X928daeea3;X9ac955769;X9e590c933;Xa839a9ea8;Xcbeebaf66;Xd45fe2f8b;Xd7d26591e;Xe47525a5f;Xef228215f;Xf498164a6,28,"$G^{k,l}$-constrained multi-degree reduction of B\'ezier curves",http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03032,2015

We also describe a practical solution to demonstrate how to efficiently implement a typical Divide-and-Conquer algorithm on the GPU. We highly utilize the parallel primitives provided by the library Thrust such as the parallel segmented scan for better efficiency and simplicity. To evaluate the performance of our implementation, we carry out four groups of experimental tests using two groups of point sets in two modes on the GPU K20c. Experimental results indicate that: our implementation can achieve the speedups of up to 10.98x over the state-of-art CPU-based convex hull implementation Qhull [16]. In addition, our implementation can find the convex hull of 20M points in about 0.2 seconds.","Zhang, Jiayin;Mei, Gang;Xu, Nengxiong;Zhao, Kunyang",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00e1301ea, X026c90bfe, X040fc33dc, X05b0a2da8, X07ae95b00, X0843ddabd, X08595a2a3, X0a84fb99d, X0c19e8ed9, X0cddee885, X0e3ef4b29, X0fa719586, X10d826c10, X12a1fc7a4, X16d229f2c, X1a55b2ad8, X1c497e53b, X1fcce7747, X204cd7bf6, X2460f51d1, X24c156427, X2b54bcc96, X2b90b7033, X2bc761741, X2c8df9b0d, X2e56e84c9, X2f11d5179, X2fe9b7e50, X2ffff6ad0, X32be5be3e, X39aadb175, X3b375e9c8, X3b791a4dc, X4941c68c3, X4a0e0298e, X4a528a8b1, X4bd724667, X52660a69e, X52b226819, X62faaadd4, X67c883e46, X6ae63575e, X73f4a0f7e, X7720c06cf, X776a73a38, X77dabfec3, X7941edde1, X7950021ff, X7b23ecf06, X7e5f04fc6, X7f91b95df, X7fd5df8de, X87a6d6156, X8c9c00635, X928daeea3, X931d6478d, X96d2bb012, X9827d7f9c, X9a0a0345a, X9e68784d0, Xa00524190, Xa839a9ea8, Xac75f43ab, Xae31423de, Xb1ccc025c, Xb5c8db97d, Xb8ecf1898, Xc63249ac9, Xc9a827560, Xcbcf2f811, Xd45fe2f8b, Xd8a4a7a66, Xe01d20346, Xe1b387cff, Xe685cf7a5, Xe730c33a6, Xe756a2da8, Xe9ae1dee1, Xef5df3be2, Xf2d700b4e, Xf7bf0a7e9, Xf7eec358b]",X00e1301ea;X026c90bfe;X040fc33dc;X05b0a2da8;X07ae95b00;X0843ddabd;X08595a2a3;X0a84fb99d;X0c19e8ed9;X0cddee885;X0e3ef4b29;X0fa719586;X10d826c10;X12a1fc7a4;X16d229f2c;X1a55b2ad8;X1c497e53b;X1fcce7747;X204cd7bf6;X2460f51d1;X24c156427;X2b54bcc96;X2b90b7033;X2bc761741;X2c8df9b0d;X2e56e84c9;X2f11d5179;X2fe9b7e50;X2ffff6ad0;X32be5be3e;X39aadb175;X3b375e9c8;X3b791a4dc;X4941c68c3;X4a0e0298e;X4a528a8b1;X4bd724667;X52660a69e;X52b226819;X62faaadd4;X67c883e46;X6ae63575e;X73f4a0f7e;X7720c06cf;X776a73a38;X77dabfec3;X7941edde1;X7950021ff;X7b23ecf06;X7e5f04fc6;X7f91b95df;X7fd5df8de;X87a6d6156;X8c9c00635;X928daeea3;X931d6478d;X96d2bb012;X9827d7f9c;X9a0a0345a;X9e68784d0;Xa00524190;Xa839a9ea8;Xac75f43ab;Xae31423de;Xb1ccc025c;Xb5c8db97d;Xb8ecf1898;Xc63249ac9;Xc9a827560;Xcbcf2f811;Xd45fe2f8b;Xd8a4a7a66;Xe01d20346;Xe1b387cff;Xe685cf7a5;Xe730c33a6;Xe756a2da8;Xe9ae1dee1;Xef5df3be2;Xf2d700b4e;Xf7bf0a7e9;Xf7eec358b,82,A Novel Implementation of QuickHull Algorithm on the GPU,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04706,2015

271,"3D motion tracking is a critical task in many computer vision applications. Existing 3D motion tracking techniques require either a great amount of knowledge on the target object or specific hardware. These requirements discourage the wide spread of commercial applications based on 3D motion tracking. 3D motion tracking systems that require no knowledge on the target object and run on a single low-budget camera require estimations of the object projection features (namely, area and position). In this paper, we define the object projection feature estimation problem and we present a novel 3D motion tracking system that needs no knowledge on the target object and that only requires a single low-budget camera, as installed in most computers and smartphones. Our system estimates, in real time, the three-dimensional position of a non-modeled unmarked object that may be non-rigid, non-convex, partially occluded, self occluded, or motion blurred, given that it is opaque, evenly colored, and enough contrasting with the background in each frame. Our system is also able to determine the most relevant object to track in the screen. Our 3D motion tracking system does not impose hard constraints, therefore it allows a market-wide implementation of applications that use 3D motion tracking.","Quesada, Luis;León, Alejandro J.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0e318d1f0, X4a28fe1d1, X6230f5c70, X7c6c2954a, X91b706b6c, Xc500db453]",X0e318d1f0;X4a28fe1d1;X6230f5c70;X7c6c2954a;X91b706b6c;Xc500db453,6,The Object Projection Feature Estimation Problem in Unsupervised Markerless 3D Motion Tracking,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3969,2011
272,"Motions of virtual characters in movies or video games are typically generated by recording actors using motion capturing methods. Animations generated this way often need postprocessing, such as improving the periodicity of cyclic animations or generating entirely new motions by interpolation of existing ones. Furthermore, search and classification of recorded motions becomes more and more important as the amount of recorded motion data grows. In this paper, we will apply methods from shape analysis to the processing of animations. More precisely, we will use the by now classical elastic metric model used in shape matching, and extend it by incorporating additional inexact feature point information, which leads to an improved temporal alignment of different animations.","Bauer, Martin;Eslitzbichler, Markus;Grasmair, Markus",ArXiv e-prints,"[53f87a4e26, X007a3f654, X00bd80b2c, X01f06cfc6, X05fd11c24, X0600064af, X07488ec6d, X09297f16b, X0b30fbadc, X0b559beb5, X0f28ce253, X14b889fd0, X175d2f91d, X175e4abd3, X17717deef, X1ad1007aa, X1b759dd87, X24c156427, X258f767fa, X2bb09881e, X2cadd47ee, X2eb9aec3e, X2ed1220df, X2ef0dfe1d, X3067907fc, X31f8fedc6, X3325123b6, X342948fb3, X362e60f42, X36cfb2dde, X3a27a959b, X3b375e9c8, X3b5fcaa6c, X3ce5b5901, X3d5d2acd7, X3d70ecd89, X4108030c1, X4172a9866, X43b8e250b, X45ba6c455, X4866dc3ec, X48f034baa, X4913d52e7, X4b6476189, X4d95b811e, X4f7963845, X50cd7567b, X50d708f43, X529112015, X56a42e0a7, X573fd84d8, X58af12aaa, X593f8c8b1, X5b6ef911f, X5e9737de2, X60caf7867, X613beec36, X62acc3a3d, X63769d36e, X63fa8e323, X646ed9be8, X6588090ac, X65fa53b6b, X674531e05, X6ba7866f1, X6d3036b24, X6ecd3e266, X70632a4c9, X71a645c33, X72af35fe8, X7316da1cd, X73d1c102a, X744f494ed, X756a9c9cc, X77dc3abc7, X784013370, X7a1238d43, X7a37dd8ba, X7ab6cfcee, X7bb5ecb52, X7ef0e7dcd, X7fe7bbbac, X802ad76d2, X82ce26466, X852688b9a, X877a9d5ec, X87dafb582, X88c401792, X89e72553f, X8afa48272, X8cff3cac9, X8f72043ee, X908b7704a, X91377d1de, X92b3a2e60, X93ef5a47f, X94b356a12, X95ba1f169, X9633f035f, X9821cafb0, ...]",53f87a4e26;X007a3f654;X00bd80b2c;X01f06cfc6;X05fd11c24;X0600064af;X07488ec6d;X09297f16b;X0b30fbadc;X0b559beb5;X0f28ce253;X14b889fd0;X175d2f91d;X175e4abd3;X17717deef;X1ad1007aa;X1b759dd87;X24c156427;X258f767fa;X2bb09881e;X2cadd47ee;X2eb9aec3e;X2ed1220df;X2ef0dfe1d;X3067907fc;X31f8fedc6;X3325123b6;X342948fb3;X362e60f42;X36cfb2dde;X3a27a959b;X3b375e9c8;X3b5fcaa6c;X3ce5b5901;X3d5d2acd7;X3d70ecd89;X4108030c1;X4172a9866;X43b8e250b;X45ba6c455;X4866dc3ec;X48f034baa;X4913d52e7;X4b6476189;X4d95b811e;X4f7963845;X50cd7567b;X50d708f43;X529112015;X56a42e0a7;X573fd84d8;X58af12aaa;X593f8c8b1;X5b6ef911f;X5e9737de2;X60caf7867;X613beec36;X62acc3a3d;X63769d36e;X63fa8e323;X646ed9be8;X6588090ac;X65fa53b6b;X674531e05;X6ba7866f1;X6d3036b24;X6ecd3e266;X70632a4c9;X71a645c33;X72af35fe8;X7316da1cd;X73d1c102a;X744f494ed;X756a9c9cc;X77dc3abc7;X784013370;X7a1238d43;X7a37dd8ba;X7ab6cfcee;X7bb5ecb52;X7ef0e7dcd;X7fe7bbbac;X802ad76d2;X82ce26466;X852688b9a;X877a9d5ec;X87dafb582;X88c401792;X89e72553f;X8afa48272;X8cff3cac9;X8f72043ee;X908b7704a;X91377d1de;X92b3a2e60;X93ef5a47f;X94b356a12;X95ba1f169;X9633f035f;X9821cafb0;X989125c83;X9a0a0345a;X9e68e9746;X9f209585e;Xa474b43f5;Xa4eaa36ac;Xa62e2ec80;Xa647ecffa;Xa659a8bc4;Xa6f80b09c;Xabe9a89e2;Xac02dc59e;Xad3a60751;Xaed5f7894;Xaf353ea0c;Xb05ccdce2;Xb11bc0a6f;Xb1ccc025c;Xb912e1b53;Xbac76d770;Xbba2dcd71;Xbbef692dd;Xbc9da54f1;Xbcba39a4b;Xbd3f77c16;Xbdd6d9066;Xc01213e6e;Xc070766f7;Xc128950b9;Xc32a314d1;Xc52a39115;Xc6b7f4671;Xcca4d6670;Xcdf1e0f67;Xd1fe702b7;Xd2383506e;Xd5b2a92bc;Xd62f7cd38;Xd6f93799d;Xd7c8fe091;Xdb93e3a66;Xe0e445cc3;Xe30093a0b;Xe6f645a62;Xe728eeee2;Xe7729eb64;Xec001373d;Xedb9fc3a2;Xee29ed786;Xef16e991f;Xf1adcdead;Xf4799c5a3;Xf7eec358b;Xf808d0164;Xf813c1484;Xf9dea2520;Xfba3d1cbb;Xfe7fb6d71,158,Landmark-Guided Elastic Shape Analysis of Human Character Motions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07666,2015

274,"Sculptors often deviate from geometric accuracy in order to enhance the appearance of their sculpture. These subtle stylizations may emphasize anatomy, draw the viewer's focus to characteristic features of the subject, or symbolize textures that might not be accurately reproduced in a particular sculptural medium, while still retaining fidelity to the unique proportions of an individual. In this work we demonstrate an interactive system for enhancing face geometry using a class of stylizations based on visual decomposition into abstract semantic regions, which we call sculptural abstraction. We propose an interactive two-scale optimization framework for stylization based on sculptural abstraction, allowing real-time adjustment of both global and local parameters. We demonstrate this system's effectiveness in enhancing physical 3D prints of scans from various sources.","Jachnik, Jan;Goldman, Dan B;Luo, Linjie;Davison, Andrew J.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X006311ef7, X03a861a0d, X04c76461f, X059fe16c4, X060b02504, X067c014a0, X07f86164b, X0c60958ab, X106ad9c91, X14787ba75, X158f4115a, X16628a179, X16d229f2c, X19cb84514, X1a7596a67, X1b9c0548f, X1e9143ab9, X204cd7bf6, X204da7876, X211feb3c4, X21987ba4e, X21e51d306, X23ad77c0c, X242ec5d87, X25002ddd1, X255bdc0f5, X27238733a, X29c45ba3a, X2b71a20c2, X2d170f90f, X2d7ea559b, X2d8ed16b1, X2db7ec692, X2e56e84c9, X2e5e86835, X2ef0dfe1d, X30039d9f3, X31198d178, X39e72362e, X3a01366b1, X3b5fcaa6c, X3c73f09f9, X3cb90596a, X3fea08968, X4006723c7, X40de944f0, X42cb590f7, X435ec8ef7, X43d29f14f, X44a1c1141, X44e22305d, X47a7cf1f2, X483b5ae47, X4bd724667, X4bea056ca, X517ac2c47, X5188f84ad, X53290fbcf, X554a9b0d5, X55f681539, X575d61153, X58075a981, X59591a6aa, X59b5390b9, X59c850fac, X5a55d35f2, X5cec5510a, X60f93f5e6, X615649ddc, X61e958796, X64632df8c, X6485d7de1, X6588090ac, X66233665f, X6786a42b1, X69af13f5d, X6a893f35f, X6b8538965, X6c2a79a81, X6ccc4ebad, X6d5862d9a, X734ada807, X73bfae255, X75fdd790e, X76dbb3c62, X77994de26, X7a1238d43, X7aeab8dae, X7c1a4fee2, X7d026479a, X7e5f230f8, X7eebe3da5, X7f5271167, X802010e3f, X82f34f573, X83dc48084, X8426ae536, X84ccdadd0, X85dc4dfc6, X86d74e8c2, ...]",X006311ef7;X03a861a0d;X04c76461f;X059fe16c4;X060b02504;X067c014a0;X07f86164b;X0c60958ab;X106ad9c91;X14787ba75;X158f4115a;X16628a179;X16d229f2c;X19cb84514;X1a7596a67;X1b9c0548f;X1e9143ab9;X204cd7bf6;X204da7876;X211feb3c4;X21987ba4e;X21e51d306;X23ad77c0c;X242ec5d87;X25002ddd1;X255bdc0f5;X27238733a;X29c45ba3a;X2b71a20c2;X2d170f90f;X2d7ea559b;X2d8ed16b1;X2db7ec692;X2e56e84c9;X2e5e86835;X2ef0dfe1d;X30039d9f3;X31198d178;X39e72362e;X3a01366b1;X3b5fcaa6c;X3c73f09f9;X3cb90596a;X3fea08968;X4006723c7;X40de944f0;X42cb590f7;X435ec8ef7;X43d29f14f;X44a1c1141;X44e22305d;X47a7cf1f2;X483b5ae47;X4bd724667;X4bea056ca;X517ac2c47;X5188f84ad;X53290fbcf;X554a9b0d5;X55f681539;X575d61153;X58075a981;X59591a6aa;X59b5390b9;X59c850fac;X5a55d35f2;X5cec5510a;X60f93f5e6;X615649ddc;X61e958796;X64632df8c;X6485d7de1;X6588090ac;X66233665f;X6786a42b1;X69af13f5d;X6a893f35f;X6b8538965;X6c2a79a81;X6ccc4ebad;X6d5862d9a;X734ada807;X73bfae255;X75fdd790e;X76dbb3c62;X77994de26;X7a1238d43;X7aeab8dae;X7c1a4fee2;X7d026479a;X7e5f230f8;X7eebe3da5;X7f5271167;X802010e3f;X82f34f573;X83dc48084;X8426ae536;X84ccdadd0;X85dc4dfc6;X86d74e8c2;X8ae9c42b2;X8bf9acee3;X8c43cc7f6;X8cd023355;X8d7fffe98;X8f6048f84;X8f664a7e3;X903967f76;X909f64ef9;X910677abf;X912d60009;X94b356a12;X94e0f13f8;X96f2e38b3;X978f3a04f;X97a1c3ab9;X9918b86bf;X9939651a1;X9cf58632c;X9cfc4317d;X9d2976c44;X9d7fdbdfc;X9e33b8529;X9f861e350;X9fd6a7b34;Xa092252c3;Xa1345b2ad;Xa302c16f6;Xa466b8f10;Xa5bcda30e;Xa5db95634;Xad02352e6;Xae3823244;Xb0751d9e2;Xb14a7ea34;Xb177e6f81;Xb1d2f3969;Xb255a6666;Xb69af593a;Xb7c0259aa;Xb7c1c28c3;Xb9751ae91;Xb9abe5caa;Xb9d7f7588;Xbb702f971;Xbd50a1e6c;Xbde30c2f3;Xbe4e39122;Xbee8d89d7;Xc01213e6e;Xc22f027f0;Xc26c7ff85;Xc3fd27c10;Xc4bb64141;Xc6c873840;Xc809bb214;Xc9d06e699;Xcee546449;Xcf75cb296;Xd04f08c08;Xd05422f0f;Xd5303ec58;Xd746cb651;Xd746fd75d;Xd84ff8e16;Xd9ba01fcb;Xdb3fc0bdf;Xdc5ecd805;Xdd3b1ea12;Xdfef364e3;Xe05143a98;Xe113b4be0;Xe124e2ca6;Xe1ec46f82;Xe20412fc8;Xe2f1fe5eb;Xe3af0a95e;Xe6c5caa94;Xe7a5d204b;Xe8ddef019;Xe998a58d5;Xea78b4c1e;Xebe87f195;Xecfb40154;Xeddaecb67;Xf18b22127;Xf1c7a4f10;Xf2c3d297a;Xf2d700b4e;Xf330fe452;Xf41c182e5;Xf614d0bd9;Xf72720a65;Xf7eec358b;Xf9b7d58fb;Xfad158c7f;Xfd5ff65e4;Xfe0dcd017;Xfe8471b84,199,Interactive 3D Face Stylization Using Sculptural Abstraction,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01954,2015

276,"Marching surfaces is a method for isosurface extraction and approximation based on a $G^1$ multi-sided patch interpolation scheme. Given a 3D grid of scalar values, an underlying curve network is formed using second order information and cubic Hermite splines. Circular arc fitting defines the tangent vectors for the Hermite curves at specified isovalues. Once the boundary curve network is formed, a loop of curves is determined for each grid cell and then interpolated with multi-sided surface patches, which are $G^1$ continuous at the joins. The data economy of the method and its continuity preserving properties provide an effective compression scheme, ideal for indirect volume rendering on mobile devices, or collaborating on the Internet, while enhancing visual fidelity. The use of multi-sided patches enables a more natural way to approximate the isosurfaces than using a fixed number of sides or polygons as is proposed in the literature. This assertion is supported with comparisons to the traditional Marching Cubes algorithm and other $G^1$ methods.","Chávez, Gustavo;Rockwood, Alyn",ArXiv e-prints,"[X050ea014e, X0697c9952, X16d229f2c, X1d03b02e8, X20deca748, X242ec5d87, X24c156427, X2bc761741, X2e5c48349, X2ef0dfe1d, X2f5a02bdc, X3d5d2acd7, X3f82c45ef, X3fece5344, X43b8e250b, X46de5627c, X47d271195, X4b0d7118e, X5188f84ad, X55458f9c9, X63e6c5157, X6588090ac, X6a12b0e36, X6ae3d55ee, X6c23585bd, X6d3036b24, X6ddd042c5, X703d3a1d6, X713005df2, X7480ec026, X81fab448d, X8281b3ddf, X8426ae536, X8a6bfa7e9, X8b6157898, X8d0d603ba, X928daeea3, X9bcc63902, X9c971b232, Xa18a1ebbc, Xa241bf592, Xa4cadfd01, Xa7856da67, Xae1a7a544, Xbb702f971, Xc0cf2fc3d, Xe4cc12be9, Xe5897b416, Xe7eeb4c7c, Xeb1e1ec77, Xecfb40154, Xf41c182e5, Xf61e959eb, Xf7eec358b, Xfde9d989b, Xff50d842f]",X050ea014e;X0697c9952;X16d229f2c;X1d03b02e8;X20deca748;X242ec5d87;X24c156427;X2bc761741;X2e5c48349;X2ef0dfe1d;X2f5a02bdc;X3d5d2acd7;X3f82c45ef;X3fece5344;X43b8e250b;X46de5627c;X47d271195;X4b0d7118e;X5188f84ad;X55458f9c9;X63e6c5157;X6588090ac;X6a12b0e36;X6ae3d55ee;X6c23585bd;X6d3036b24;X6ddd042c5;X703d3a1d6;X713005df2;X7480ec026;X81fab448d;X8281b3ddf;X8426ae536;X8a6bfa7e9;X8b6157898;X8d0d603ba;X928daeea3;X9bcc63902;X9c971b232;Xa18a1ebbc;Xa241bf592;Xa4cadfd01;Xa7856da67;Xae1a7a544;Xbb702f971;Xc0cf2fc3d;Xe4cc12be9;Xe5897b416;Xe7eeb4c7c;Xeb1e1ec77;Xecfb40154;Xf41c182e5;Xf61e959eb;Xf7eec358b;Xfde9d989b;Xff50d842f,56,Marching Surfaces: Isosurface Approximation using G$^1$ Multi-Sided Surfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02139,2015
277,"When animation of a humanoid figure is to be generated at run-time, instead of by replaying pre-composed motion clips, some method is required of specifying the avatar's movements in a form from which the required motion data can be automatically generated. This form must be of a more abstract nature than raw motion data: ideally, it should be independent of the particular avatar's proportions, and both writable by hand and suitable for automatic generation from higher-level descriptions of the required actions. We describe here the development and implementation of such a scripting language for the particular area of sign languages of the deaf, called SiGML (Signing Gesture Markup Language), based on the existing HamNoSys notation for sign languages. We conclude by suggesting how this work may be extended to more general animation for interactive virtual reality applications.","Kennaway, Richard",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0dec45bf2, X11fb987e7, X16d229f2c, X1723bcaee, X1b481e38a, X1b947ca5f, X24c156427, X2dd1c53b9, X2ef0dfe1d, X3076e3673, X34e73046e, X3692a603e, X3f9f6916c, X46b3bba74, X46de5627c, X48ad0e866, X4aebff76f, X4b27e5a32, X4c2483cc9, X4e1d85fd5, X4fa3af973, X4fe522b8e, X5188f84ad, X526ea30be, X60c7eb8f4, X62598f7a5, X6588090ac, X66f6d0c31, X6a0960889, X6c1d32b27, X760ccc478, X7be1f0883, X7cb3a26ae, X8426ae536, X8a6bfa7e9, X8d276bb7c, X8e81760cf, X90a41668b, X9110270f9, X925949db7, X937404cf2, X95b88d951, X9898ffe69, X990fc8b69, X9cf58632c, X9d1be04b9, Xa26cd9474, Xa45966e2c, Xa5887af8b, Xab1ff4b29, Xb32bc8a08, Xb4c99add3, Xbb55cd0cb, Xbb7041abc, Xc4aad0a27, Xc7c5c6d5b, Xd5fbe02a0, Xdf161bc68, Xe039073a5, Xe12ed35b9, Xe1de1ed0a, Xe325772b6, Xecd56874a, Xecfb40154, Xed2e70644, Xf41c182e5, Xf61e959eb, Xf9740b47e, Xfb3e8c75b]",X0dec45bf2;X11fb987e7;X16d229f2c;X1723bcaee;X1b481e38a;X1b947ca5f;X24c156427;X2dd1c53b9;X2ef0dfe1d;X3076e3673;X34e73046e;X3692a603e;X3f9f6916c;X46b3bba74;X46de5627c;X48ad0e866;X4aebff76f;X4b27e5a32;X4c2483cc9;X4e1d85fd5;X4fa3af973;X4fe522b8e;X5188f84ad;X526ea30be;X60c7eb8f4;X62598f7a5;X6588090ac;X66f6d0c31;X6a0960889;X6c1d32b27;X760ccc478;X7be1f0883;X7cb3a26ae;X8426ae536;X8a6bfa7e9;X8d276bb7c;X8e81760cf;X90a41668b;X9110270f9;X925949db7;X937404cf2;X95b88d951;X9898ffe69;X990fc8b69;X9cf58632c;X9d1be04b9;Xa26cd9474;Xa45966e2c;Xa5887af8b;Xab1ff4b29;Xb32bc8a08;Xb4c99add3;Xbb55cd0cb;Xbb7041abc;Xc4aad0a27;Xc7c5c6d5b;Xd5fbe02a0;Xdf161bc68;Xe039073a5;Xe12ed35b9;Xe1de1ed0a;Xe325772b6;Xecd56874a;Xecfb40154;Xed2e70644;Xf41c182e5;Xf61e959eb;Xf9740b47e;Xfb3e8c75b,69,Avatar-independent scripting for real-time gesture animation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02961,2015
278,"We present a method to accelerate global illumination computation in dynamic environments by taking advantage of limitations of the human visual system. A model of visual attention is used to locate regions of interest in a scene and to modulate spatiotemporal sensitivity. The method is applied in the form of a spatiotemporal error tolerance map. Perceptual acceleration combined with good sampling protocols provide a global illumination solution feasible for use in animation. Results indicate an order of magnitude improvement in computational speed. The method is adaptable and can also be used in image-based rendering, geometry level of detail selection, realistic image synthesis, video telephony and video compression.","Hector Yee, Yang Li",ArXiv e-prints,"[Xeb4675ada, Xfbacd89c0]",Xeb4675ada;Xfbacd89c0,2,Spatiotemporal sensistivity and visual attention for efficient rendering of dynamic environments,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0511032,2005
279,"Let G be an embedded planar undirected graph that has n vertices, m edges, and f faces but has no self-loop or multiple edge. If G is triangulated, we can encode it using {4/3}m-1 bits, improving on the best previous bound of about 1.53m bits. In case exponential time is acceptable, roughly 1.08m bits have been known to suffice. If G is triconnected, we use at most (2.5+2\log{3})\min\{n,f\}-7 bits, which is at most 2.835m bits and smaller than the best previous bound of 3m bits.

280,"Character rigging is a process of endowing a character with a set of custom manipulators and controls making it easy to animate by the animators. These controls consist of simple joints, handles, or even separate character selection windows.This research paper present an automated rigging system for quadruped characters with custom controls and manipulators for animation.The full character rigging mechanism is procedurally driven based on various principles and requirements used by the riggers and animators. The automation is achieved initially by creating widgets according to the character type. These widgets then can be customized by the rigger according to the character shape, height and proportion. Then joint locations for each body parts are calculated and widgets are replaced programmatically.Finally a complete and fully operational procedurally generated character control rig is created and attached with the underlying skeletal joints. The functionality and feasibility of the rig was analyzed from various source of actual character motion and a requirements criterion was met. The final rigged character provides an efficient and easy to manipulate control rig with no lagging and at high frame rate.","Bhatti, Zeeshan;Shah, Asadullah;Waqas, Ahmad;Mahmood, Nadeem",ArXiv e-prints,"[X02408d5f0, X02b9794f9, X05889a1aa, X060b02504, X09b8b3a39, X0a3a63df9, X0ae3d802a, X0bea2293e, X0bf11a0cf, X0e8a173b4, X0f7b82dd5, X12b65e835, X139e0c7cf, X15ac6afa9, X1773d15bd, X17ccc0551, X1cc2269f4, X20c5bc97d, X21f85ff46, X227d0dc2c, X24c156427, X254d89adf, X25baa9117, X2c176d65f, X2cbb37c14, X2ce11b6a6, X2d0f02a09, X2e9cea786, X2ef0dfe1d, X2f22c420c, X3076e3673, X3475a0dbd, X3538da58f, X358c64c07, X362553515, X3681bee15, X36fc14569, X37ff50316, X38060f710, X395f195dc, X39625d9b8, X3a3f74083, X3be1d2f1d, X3c57b9c5b, X3cdfc35de, X3d5d2acd7, X3df9e8470, X42fbd177b, X43b8e250b, X43c115de6, X487192f1a, X4b8b6b2f5, X4dcc5490e, X5351975dd, X553ad4dba, X57278d530, X59012477a, X59ce1926e, X5a1fb2119, X5bdda50a7, X5da5a4a6c, X5f5caccfb, X60c8973d8, X614a26150, X6235fae48, X63769d36e, X63dc98c34, X6569b47bf, X6588090ac, X66a4a9fcf, X68db02d60, X68e015590, X692c71a59, X6dfcaef66, X70202d4d6, X7188a8017, X758cd7174, X7836428fe, X7b2b1d0ce, X7b311861e, X7bb5ecb52, X7e3a8ce3d, X7f4aef04f, X80be95f1c, X80caec5fb, X818967884, X8347e185b, X8381238e4, X83e24950d, X86c9437f7, X870b895c3, X87a20c20b, X87b06aa4a, X8afbabbd8, X8d276bb7c, X8f902dc63, X8ffb7f907, X90a726cd6, X928daeea3, X9362a2420, ...]",X02408d5f0;X02b9794f9;X05889a1aa;X060b02504;X09b8b3a39;X0a3a63df9;X0ae3d802a;X0bea2293e;X0bf11a0cf;X0e8a173b4;X0f7b82dd5;X12b65e835;X139e0c7cf;X15ac6afa9;X1773d15bd;X17ccc0551;X1cc2269f4;X20c5bc97d;X21f85ff46;X227d0dc2c;X24c156427;X254d89adf;X25baa9117;X2c176d65f;X2cbb37c14;X2ce11b6a6;X2d0f02a09;X2e9cea786;X2ef0dfe1d;X2f22c420c;X3076e3673;X3475a0dbd;X3538da58f;X358c64c07;X362553515;X3681bee15;X36fc14569;X37ff50316;X38060f710;X395f195dc;X39625d9b8;X3a3f74083;X3be1d2f1d;X3c57b9c5b;X3cdfc35de;X3d5d2acd7;X3df9e8470;X42fbd177b;X43b8e250b;X43c115de6;X487192f1a;X4b8b6b2f5;X4dcc5490e;X5351975dd;X553ad4dba;X57278d530;X59012477a;X59ce1926e;X5a1fb2119;X5bdda50a7;X5da5a4a6c;X5f5caccfb;X60c8973d8;X614a26150;X6235fae48;X63769d36e;X63dc98c34;X6569b47bf;X6588090ac;X66a4a9fcf;X68db02d60;X68e015590;X692c71a59;X6dfcaef66;X70202d4d6;X7188a8017;X758cd7174;X7836428fe;X7b2b1d0ce;X7b311861e;X7bb5ecb52;X7e3a8ce3d;X7f4aef04f;X80be95f1c;X80caec5fb;X818967884;X8347e185b;X8381238e4;X83e24950d;X86c9437f7;X870b895c3;X87a20c20b;X87b06aa4a;X8afbabbd8;X8d276bb7c;X8f902dc63;X8ffb7f907;X90a726cd6;X928daeea3;X9362a2420;X9489f61b9;X9c322688e;X9f8331528;X9fa51bcf8;Xa1e544dfe;Xa443126f8;Xa72b94caa;Xa770c1662;Xa8fa5a741;Xa96bb7b12;Xaaf1dff52;Xacbb4f039;Xad497106e;Xaf2992797;Xb08e5e7dd;Xb35a0f76f;Xb4bafa3dc;Xb4db7d708;Xb521fa7f8;Xb7f2c4133;Xbb6d4c75d;Xbd2e72698;Xbd74722d2;Xc01213e6e;Xc25d2eff1;Xc3082282c;Xc38e17260;Xc5dd0fd52;Xc8a56abf7;Xc8ab5c136;Xc9144899e;Xcc4be1be0;Xccc828183;Xccf27cd2c;Xcd721d160;Xce5e92e49;Xd14b2568f;Xd40595885;Xdabcf8de2;Xdac4c723a;Xdbb632b47;Xdfceb039d;Xe48329c9e;Xe92c366e8;Xeb8148d46;Xec9a0eb3b;Xefed59bc8;Xf3d39bcad;Xf40eecbe0;Xf41c182e5;Xf74d65833;Xf78032e0f;Xf844be639;Xf8b755325;Xf95b6b8ca;Xfed094772;Xffe1c016c,157,Analysis of Design Principles and Requirements for Procedural Rigging of Bipeds and Quadrupeds Characters with Custom Manipulators for Animation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06419,2015
281,"We present a multi-scale approach to sketch-based shape retrieval. It is based on a novel multi-scale shape descriptor called Pyramidof- Parts, which encodes the features and spatial relationship of the semantic parts of query sketches. The same descriptor can also be used to represent 2D projected views of 3D shapes, allowing effective matching of query sketches with 3D shapes across multiple scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method, whether the sketch segmentation information is obtained manually or automatically by considering each stroke as a semantic part.","Zou, Changqing;Huang, Zhe;Lau, Rynson W.

282,"The midpoint method or technique is a measurement and as each measurement it has a tolerance, but worst of all it can be invalid, called Out-of-Control or OoC. The core of all midpoint methods is the accurate measurement of the difference of the squared distances of two points to the polar of their midpoint with respect to the conic. When this measurement is valid, it also measures the difference of the squared distances of these points to the conic, although it may be inaccurate, called Out-of-Accuracy or OoA. The primary condition is the necessary and sufficient condition that a measurement is valid. It is comletely new and it can be checked ultra fast and before the actual measurement starts. Modeling an incremental algorithm, shows that the curve must be subdivided into piecewise monotonic sections, the start point must be optimal, and it explains that the 2D-incremental method can find, locally, the global Least Square Distance. Locally means that there are at most three candidate points for a given monotonic direction; therefore the 2D-midpoint method has, locally, at most three measurements. When all the possible measurements are invalid, the midpoint method cannot be applied, and in that case the ultra fast OoC-rule selects the candidate point. This guarantees, for the first time, a 100% stable, ultra-fast, berserkless midpoint algorithm, which can be easily transformed to hardware.","Huypens, Valere",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0047a30a1, X036b01730, X066efb484, X172add237, X1b759dd87, X1be0cf804, X2a7778f23, X2a9e5e6c9, X2ef0dfe1d, X3076e3673, X362e60f42, X3df9e8470, X44bff9a8d, X4a1777b46, X4c2483cc9, X4dcd2896b, X5a51ba639, X5fbaf22e9, X62cf7e3f3, X63769d36e, X6436e9db7, X6588090ac, X6ba7866f1, X7b9a520a7, X87e8eed2d, X93c2a1286, X9b7f7975f, X9b93c5e53, X9cf58632c, Xb11bc0a6f, Xb4c99add3, Xb867b0f61, Xbb702f971, Xc01213e6e, Xc05c1e49a, Xc069f6bff, Xc13a36fec, Xc33557776, Xc871a19e3, Xd20b5e9e0, Xd22bb8342, Xd6e08c082, Xda380f1ea, Xebbc2b5b1, Xec8e900fe, Xf41c182e5, Xf61e959eb, Xf63030080, Xfb01aac70, Xfc7083ccb, Xffe64f404]",X0047a30a1;X036b01730;X066efb484;X172add237;X1b759dd87;X1be0cf804;X2a7778f23;X2a9e5e6c9;X2ef0dfe1d;X3076e3673;X362e60f42;X3df9e8470;X44bff9a8d;X4a1777b46;X4c2483cc9;X4dcd2896b;X5a51ba639;X5fbaf22e9;X62cf7e3f3;X63769d36e;X6436e9db7;X6588090ac;X6ba7866f1;X7b9a520a7;X87e8eed2d;X93c2a1286;X9b7f7975f;X9b93c5e53;X9cf58632c;Xb11bc0a6f;Xb4c99add3;Xb867b0f61;Xbb702f971;Xc01213e6e;Xc05c1e49a;Xc069f6bff;Xc13a36fec;Xc33557776;Xc871a19e3;Xd20b5e9e0;Xd22bb8342;Xd6e08c082;Xda380f1ea;Xebbc2b5b1;Xec8e900fe;Xf41c182e5;Xf61e959eb;Xf63030080;Xfb01aac70;Xfc7083ccb;Xffe64f404,51,Relative Squared Distances to a Conic Berserkless 8-Connected Midpoint Algorithm,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04268,2015
283,"Data-driven methods play an increasingly important role in discovering geometric, structural, and semantic relationships between 3D shapes in collections, and applying this analysis to support intelligent modeling, editing, and visualization of geometric data. In contrast to traditional approaches, a key feature of data-driven approaches is that they aggregate information from a collection of shapes to improve the analysis and processing of individual shapes. In addition, they are able to learn models that reason about properties and relationships of shapes without relying on hard-coded rules or explicitly programmed instructions. We provide an overview of the main concepts and components of these techniques, and discuss their application to shape classification, segmentation, matching, reconstruction, modeling and exploration, as well as scene analysis and synthesis, through reviewing the literature and relating the existing works with both qualitative and numerical comparisons. We conclude our report with ideas that can inspire future research in data-driven shape analysis and processing.","Xu, Kai;Kim, Vladimir G.;Huang, Qixing;Kalogerakis, Evangelos",ArXiv e-prints,"[5530116394, X00cee5edc, X00fa7a190, X0182383cd, X0221a7bfd, X02dfa410a, X03398c784, X036b01730, X0664defaf, X084c2e98b, X085a9bc6c, X08614c717, X09273f859, X0abf97c02, X0b467d7d7, X0b51e00e9, X0bb1aa2e7, X0bed0c22d, X0c01d71aa, X0c0694c0b, X0e9147a93, X0ee5cfd6e, X0f51d8ba1, X106db5e7a, X109c508f9, X11fead4ca, X139d75727, X15183895e, X167184893, X175c79370, X1776d2c56, X1817c1086, X1a1562359, X1c652109e, X1c6e33079, X1cdbcc157, X1d70cda10, X1f5458149, X205f4b640, X211b79b4a, X2792f3b24, X27b9c91d2, X27bfe6569, X27c9620d6, X28ae23a98, X2bee6b557, X2c3136066, X2d2e497e9, X2eb4320ab, X2ef0dfe1d, X2eff79678, X2f7e970c8, X2fa33fb96, X30039d9f3, X305189004, X3076e3673, X337136e87, X33bc5bce1, X33f89a997, X35e058680, X363a435e8, X3660a4d80, X37b3b66f1, X38320f361, X39acf7a59, X39dfe0f6d, X39e72362e, X3a4922b7e, X3a849ba85, X3a9923d27, X3b08352ae, X3b42012c9, X3b56d16c9, X3b5fcaa6c, X3b731cd7d, X3c8749508, X3cf50454c, X3d07c697f, X3d3295bae, X3d7a244b0, X40fe25471, X421796cee, X429b40d8e, X43428a702, X437401e7f, X43b8e250b, X45d0af655, X47126419f, X4789429a4, X47f2d1f5d, X4b04e1bb6, X4e0478109, X4f05bd13d, X51401aaa1, X519760438, X51c8c9f2c, X520cffe0f, X58ba58e16, X58e427497, X593f8c8b1, ...]",5530116394;X00cee5edc;X00fa7a190;X0182383cd;X0221a7bfd;X02dfa410a;X03398c784;X036b01730;X0664defaf;X084c2e98b;X085a9bc6c;X08614c717;X09273f859;X0abf97c02;X0b467d7d7;X0b51e00e9;X0bb1aa2e7;X0bed0c22d;X0c01d71aa;X0c0694c0b;X0e9147a93;X0ee5cfd6e;X0f51d8ba1;X106db5e7a;X109c508f9;X11fead4ca;X139d75727;X15183895e;X167184893;X175c79370;X1776d2c56;X1817c1086;X1a1562359;X1c652109e;X1c6e33079;X1cdbcc157;X1d70cda10;X1f5458149;X205f4b640;X211b79b4a;X2792f3b24;X27b9c91d2;X27bfe6569;X27c9620d6;X28ae23a98;X2bee6b557;X2c3136066;X2d2e497e9;X2eb4320ab;X2ef0dfe1d;X2eff79678;X2f7e970c8;X2fa33fb96;X30039d9f3;X305189004;X3076e3673;X337136e87;X33bc5bce1;X33f89a997;X35e058680;X363a435e8;X3660a4d80;X37b3b66f1;X38320f361;X39acf7a59;X39dfe0f6d;X39e72362e;X3a4922b7e;X3a849ba85;X3a9923d27;X3b08352ae;X3b42012c9;X3b56d16c9;X3b5fcaa6c;X3b731cd7d;X3c8749508;X3cf50454c;X3d07c697f;X3d3295bae;X3d7a244b0;X40fe25471;X421796cee;X429b40d8e;X43428a702;X437401e7f;X43b8e250b;X45d0af655;X47126419f;X4789429a4;X47f2d1f5d;X4b04e1bb6;X4e0478109;X4f05bd13d;X51401aaa1;X519760438;X51c8c9f2c;X520cffe0f;X58ba58e16;X58e427497;X593f8c8b1;X5a55d35f2;X5aa941502;X5d4bcb7e6;X5e9737de2;X5edf29907;X5f4fc3ba4;X6080eafd0;X618781793;X62a891295;X6310b8fdd;X636f49998;X6485c2d45;X64de6878a;X653b5550c;X656bec9e4;X6588090ac;X69067a9f3;X692b5706d;X695121270;X69787a17a;X6a490200f;X6b1d09d61;X6dd89ac23;X6e45fef2e;X6f54f49cc;X6fa601c33;X70b2c6e4a;X7316da1cd;X732d77e38;X736d78ef9;X741c3e182;X76579dad3;X76d68ea66;X773b2f07a;X77db68870;X7813dd121;X786c29697;X797312deb;X7b6d8c044;X7d33ffa7a;X7e14d41b6;X7e3a8ce3d;X7f3272565;X7f581a60c;X7f66d61f4;X8143682ea;X81941fb32;X8195474c7;X82918fbe9;X82edbd0ec;X834e67ee8;X836729420;X83e24950d;X84d313e5c;X8776bb413;X882b6e1aa;X8849ee733;X885cd27c1;X8a9b12cae;X8aa4bc279;X8b1aa0b95;X8bd87a0b7;X8d19cef3d;X8dcf79080;X8e5091779;X8ed46077b;X900e4ec25;X911886a29;X925a42ed6;X93b310166;X9540aa33b;X961fa57ce;X967a7dbd2;X96b429fac;X981b7a3ea;X9a2f14982;X9a660d88d;X9b803b015;X9c3b677fd;X9e331b5b0;X9fe7af186;Xa03656714;Xa10e24574;Xa1a4b2a3e;Xa212d2448;Xa2e6a7b5c;Xa428ca9a9;Xa69390096;Xa87302ca2;Xa9527f809;Xa99fcec4e;Xa9b7c866c;Xab54949c3;Xac1f03368;Xad3a60751;Xad3c06a02;Xaf2b170fd;Xb2b10b0fe;Xb32562aa7;Xb32de5eae;Xb594a9e1c;Xb92af8dcd;Xb9b9edf90;Xb9e6cbf96;Xbb702f971;Xbd4fafa36;Xbd90f08f0;Xbde2153e9;Xc01213e6e;Xc08434d57;Xc0ee18488;Xc19f4fd0f;Xc29484d04;Xc2cba78eb;Xc52a39115;Xc57922a04;Xc829ef819;Xc9825f883;Xca69f594e;Xcade3f69e;Xcb487b4f0;Xd1a0459f1;Xd2383506e;Xd2693d4df;Xd34efd2b5;Xd39291cd6;Xd4e152384;Xd4f105554;Xd6e55d16a;Xd75216f89;Xd99e40afb;Xdb1f10239;Xdc11ef31c;Xdc9e22c30;Xdcab631fb;Xdcb3e634d;Xdd6fc26a6;Xe0d7ea1d7;Xe504471cf;Xe6315cbf7;Xe678c8fca;Xe7b54a018;Xe7d887496;Xea44ecd8b;Xea56abf32;Xec583a9dc;Xedee92d35;Xefe20c87e;Xf0bc35a43;Xf2169dbac;Xf23ce4fd7;Xf3b7a62fa;Xf41c182e5;Xf516f8efd;Xf6fc97eee;Xf9473f1c0;Xfa53f7843;Xfb99a4341;Xff606f986;Xffe76a564,260,Data-Driven Shape Analysis and Processing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06686,2015
284,"We propose a novel method of efficient upsampling of a single natural image. Current methods for image upsampling tend to produce high-resolution images with either blurry salient edges, or loss of fine textural detail, or spurious noise artifacts. In our method, we mitigate these effects by modeling the input image as a sum of edge and detail layers, operating upon these layers separately, and merging the upscaled results in an automatic fashion. We formulate the upsampled output image as the solution to a non-convex energy minimization problem, and propose an algorithm to obtain a tractable approximate solution. Our algorithm comprises two main stages. 1) For the edge layer, we use a nonparametric approach by constructing a dictionary of patches from a given image, and synthesize edge regions in a higher-resolution version of the image. 2) For the detail layer, we use a global parametric texture enhancement approach to synthesize detail regions across the image. We demonstrate that our method is able to accurately reproduce sharp edges as well as synthesize photorealistic textures, while avoiding common artifacts such as ringing and haloing. In addition, our method involves no training phase or estimation of model parameters, and is easily parallelizable. We demonstrate the utility of our method on a number of challenging standard test photos.","Hegde, Chinmay;Tuzel, Oncel;Porikli, Fatih",ArXiv e-prints,"[54f670e019, X000bc1d6b, X007a3f654, X0221a7bfd, X030dea823, X040d64704, X04bb92a34, X04da5f8e6, X05b0a2da8, X060de303b, X066efb484, X08a37b2b2, X0995d0507, X099b8ca07, X0af9778a4, X0bce31a0b, X0d90f07e5, X0e010784d, X0f6fb051c, X105e91653, X106db5e7a, X10b6e9563, X123562c86, X12b65e835, X13c6a9d19, X14dec70b3, X169692bf4, X16da2e1ee, X1732dd666, X1823968ba, X19bdd1cba, X1c7c4c998, X1e06f4994, X1e8b692f2, X1eef7d72a, X1f53170b3, X207d7fb37, X20a62e767, X22fa40249, X22fd345b4, X23217f40a, X23bf62205, X252c82210, X28ac1532d, X29a9ff938, X2b0fff424, X2b5aed85d, X2cadd47ee, X2cec363c2, X2d170f90f, X2dea13073, X2ec418eca, X2ef0dfe1d, X2f1be2f91, X2f41c949c, X3090a8ccb, X30cdf1120, X326ad16a6, X3292f2362, X336702287, X33c1e851a, X362ff7e92, X38701d7c8, X3904d8dc9, X3a0b53c88, X3a3d413cb, X3a5ffc834, X3a7d12f3c, X3af01d022, X3b1d3fdf0, X3b5fcaa6c, X3bd4498d6, X3fef3f9ed, X406b49eaa, X40b2772ae, X42bc248f0, X437a9dfcf, X43afaf446, X43b8e250b, X44bc6ab4e, X4750900a8, X47a026112, X482c06653, X48ac0175e, X49bfac06a, X4ba254738, X4bdf1f976, X513c43b4f, X51540ed11, X5163fa10d, X529112015, X5347b6b0e, X5681779f1, X56a42e0a7, X5722f35eb, X576fc2ce8, X58686d6d1, X58af12aaa, X593f8c8b1, X59e302cd7, ...]",54f670e019;X000bc1d6b;X007a3f654;X0221a7bfd;X030dea823;X040d64704;X04bb92a34;X04da5f8e6;X05b0a2da8;X060de303b;X066efb484;X08a37b2b2;X0995d0507;X099b8ca07;X0af9778a4;X0bce31a0b;X0d90f07e5;X0e010784d;X0f6fb051c;X105e91653;X106db5e7a;X10b6e9563;X123562c86;X12b65e835;X13c6a9d19;X14dec70b3;X169692bf4;X16da2e1ee;X1732dd666;X1823968ba;X19bdd1cba;X1c7c4c998;X1e06f4994;X1e8b692f2;X1eef7d72a;X1f53170b3;X207d7fb37;X20a62e767;X22fa40249;X22fd345b4;X23217f40a;X23bf62205;X252c82210;X28ac1532d;X29a9ff938;X2b0fff424;X2b5aed85d;X2cadd47ee;X2cec363c2;X2d170f90f;X2dea13073;X2ec418eca;X2ef0dfe1d;X2f1be2f91;X2f41c949c;X3090a8ccb;X30cdf1120;X326ad16a6;X3292f2362;X336702287;X33c1e851a;X362ff7e92;X38701d7c8;X3904d8dc9;X3a0b53c88;X3a3d413cb;X3a5ffc834;X3a7d12f3c;X3af01d022;X3b1d3fdf0;X3b5fcaa6c;X3bd4498d6;X3fef3f9ed;X406b49eaa;X40b2772ae;X42bc248f0;X437a9dfcf;X43afaf446;X43b8e250b;X44bc6ab4e;X4750900a8;X47a026112;X482c06653;X48ac0175e;X49bfac06a;X4ba254738;X4bdf1f976;X513c43b4f;X51540ed11;X5163fa10d;X529112015;X5347b6b0e;X5681779f1;X56a42e0a7;X5722f35eb;X576fc2ce8;X58686d6d1;X58af12aaa;X593f8c8b1;X59e302cd7;X5a51ba639;X5a55d35f2;X5b19cc4fe;X5c67d020d;X5c9f5a9cd;X5e069437c;X5e9737de2;X5f4fc3ba4;X60b085240;X60f5289ed;X613beec36;X61e958796;X623c0115b;X632e460e9;X638464e1a;X63f81e0b2;X646ed9be8;X6556eae11;X6588090ac;X687d06ae9;X692dd8252;X692fd8af2;X6a893f35f;X6b6f92de1;X6c6550413;X6e32512d0;X6e8501a44;X6fc8ad2a9;X703c56a5b;X72ab42427;X736826cff;X73f4a0f7e;X75148e84f;X76b5358ad;X76d68ea66;X77dc3abc7;X7950021ff;X797db4d9c;X7a1238d43;X7d849bb6d;X7dd38cb52;X7e49fc7fe;X7ef3d9895;X7fe7bbbac;X80c152d16;X81941fb32;X83d0a8541;X843b35eef;X852688b9a;X869109276;X87ce61c13;X87ddb5537;X882c629ce;X882fce7f6;X88e6968c0;X891f627ba;X89e72553f;X8a01f68b5;X8a7696bf8;X8abbcacf6;X8acd61040;X8b83cdb86;X8d3ac9792;X8d834ccca;X8e4457a97;X8fa8f3ea0;X908de399f;X916014bc6;X91dc1de6f;X928daeea3;X92b3a2e60;X930fdd990;X93207c709;X9407622ca;X947e7b13b;X949112272;X9662fc4e4;X96f2e38b3;X9796a47c6;X97b973913;X98f9321e8;X99aa2670e;X9a0bf530f;X9b803b015;X9b93f14c1;X9c8e0333a;X9ff0a4a55;Xa0fd79e63;Xa19e210b1;Xa3f2d3ef9;Xa3f390e8d;Xa3fbe50bf;Xa40e9e02a;Xa71e4d3d0;Xa72b35843;Xa7451c4fb;Xa7bbf8a57;Xa7c8d9db6;Xa9f2efeb0;Xaa10c743b;Xaa9fcace9;Xab54949c3;Xad4cad93c;Xaed5f7894;Xb0c0801da;Xb398171b8;Xb3ebcfbe1;Xb4787f25b;Xb4c99add3;Xb568d34e4;Xb5c8db97d;Xb5e012e40;Xb6ca49dc9;Xb80a9f5e3;Xbbf4e329b;Xbc6a29013;Xbd629a685;Xbea8cd810;Xc01213e6e;Xc13a2bf85;Xc2d1946b9;Xc32640f1a;Xc341e302a;Xc3c0174f6;Xc404e4da1;Xc4726e48f;Xc4c7346a1;Xc723807c1;Xc7f61bb6d;Xc8c6f4219;Xc99b3300a;Xcc9e24f4b;Xcf997d29d;Xd07e5af90;Xd37a5bfbf;Xd5209f5f5;Xd57fec711;Xd70a0a1ba;Xd76bd38d0;Xd84c5c5ec;Xd8766a7fa;Xdb30935b9;Xdd29c35f9;Xde4d46552;Xe18d48448;Xe20e9bcdf;Xe3fe1f17f;Xe5df5af7b;Xe60ce9b4a;Xe61de66a4;Xe952863fd;Xea618b7e0;Xea6f0dd90;Xebf22e628;Xebfcafc72;Xed4c1effa;Xed9dcdb37;Xeeb63b9f0;Xef358bcbe;Xef866a37c;Xf2b8c1622;Xf2fecaaa7;Xf6501283c;Xf8582b95b;Xf9e12b166;Xfa48751ae;Xfaddbe291;Xfbba7c0e5;Xfdc6e5807;Xfe40abde2;Xff7adbef5,271,Efficient Upsampling of Natural Images,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00040,2015
285,"The exploding growth of digital data in the information era and its immeasurable potential value has called for different types of data-driven techniques to exploit its value for further applications. Information visualization and data mining are two research field with such goal. While the two communities advocates different approaches of problem solving, the vision of combining the sophisticated algorithmic techniques from data mining as well as the intuitivity and interactivity of information visualization is tempting. In this paper, we attempt to survey recent researches and real world systems integrating the wisdom in two fields towards more effective and efficient data analytics. More specifically, we study the intersection from a data mining point of view, explore how information visualization can be used to complement and improve different stages of data mining through established theories for optimized visual presentation as well as practical toolsets for rapid development. We organize the survey by identifying three main stages of typical process of data mining, the preliminary analysis of data, the model construction, as well as the model evaluation, and study how each stage can benefit from information visualization.","Li, Keqian",ArXiv e-prints,"[454b598655, 54a9d278fb, X0106bb5fc, X01ea8c9f4, X036b01730, X049c8ff85, X049cdfd3d, X05889a1aa, X066efb484, X079f87bfd, X1023e9486, X1154b0e3f, X128a21354, X13c6a9d19, X146d92cc9, X14b889fd0, X169692bf4, X1b428b7a5, X1bd3c4b2a, X1c05f57ab, X1e806d037, X212dc53f4, X23217f40a, X24528b55a, X258f767fa, X296b9eb63, X2a83d661a, X2b5aed85d, X2c33efb4c, X2d0454223, X2ef0dfe1d, X2fa7d9ef7, X34b901e06, X36cfb2dde, X389be5ea2, X39f7b3850, X3a7d12f3c, X3ac4e41b1, X3c8749508, X3ceaf4124, X3d3d0c4f1, X3d65c9a09, X3f0ab277e, X40890b02d, X40b2772ae, X44f9768cf, X49533565c, X498f2f833, X4be6fb099, X4c857cee8, X4dd09130d, X4fa07d87a, X51cf4ffa7, X56d5ab4da, X5786449eb, X58af12aaa, X5a55d35f2, X5bc880be4, X5f4fc3ba4, X612ada3af, X613beec36, X6588090ac, X65f5bd093, X687d06ae9, X68d208943, X69038d44d, X6be729998, X6cf3cdabd, X6e0284e46, X6e97adbff, X6edb8a237, X7105c13bd, X75148e84f, X76525184e, X791a5889a, X7950021ff, X79b11e4d4, X7ab6cfcee, X7b6e82a8a, X7bb5ecb52, X7c1cd6bc5, X7e5f230f8, X8106e7b65, X81d08133a, X8305bffaa, X83858dbb5, X85f3deaee, X863ef8a58, X88dbfacbd, X8a47a33af, X8f158ef01, X9226e486f, X92761771f, X942cd2641, X97e0e9c5e, X9e68e9746, X9e8622433, Xa206a4cba, Xa531d3eca, Xa541fd580, ...]",454b598655;54a9d278fb;X0106bb5fc;X01ea8c9f4;X036b01730;X049c8ff85;X049cdfd3d;X05889a1aa;X066efb484;X079f87bfd;X1023e9486;X1154b0e3f;X128a21354;X13c6a9d19;X146d92cc9;X14b889fd0;X169692bf4;X1b428b7a5;X1bd3c4b2a;X1c05f57ab;X1e806d037;X212dc53f4;X23217f40a;X24528b55a;X258f767fa;X296b9eb63;X2a83d661a;X2b5aed85d;X2c33efb4c;X2d0454223;X2ef0dfe1d;X2fa7d9ef7;X34b901e06;X36cfb2dde;X389be5ea2;X39f7b3850;X3a7d12f3c;X3ac4e41b1;X3c8749508;X3ceaf4124;X3d3d0c4f1;X3d65c9a09;X3f0ab277e;X40890b02d;X40b2772ae;X44f9768cf;X49533565c;X498f2f833;X4be6fb099;X4c857cee8;X4dd09130d;X4fa07d87a;X51cf4ffa7;X56d5ab4da;X5786449eb;X58af12aaa;X5a55d35f2;X5bc880be4;X5f4fc3ba4;X612ada3af;X613beec36;X6588090ac;X65f5bd093;X687d06ae9;X68d208943;X69038d44d;X6be729998;X6cf3cdabd;X6e0284e46;X6e97adbff;X6edb8a237;X7105c13bd;X75148e84f;X76525184e;X791a5889a;X7950021ff;X79b11e4d4;X7ab6cfcee;X7b6e82a8a;X7bb5ecb52;X7c1cd6bc5;X7e5f230f8;X8106e7b65;X81d08133a;X8305bffaa;X83858dbb5;X85f3deaee;X863ef8a58;X88dbfacbd;X8a47a33af;X8f158ef01;X9226e486f;X92761771f;X942cd2641;X97e0e9c5e;X9e68e9746;X9e8622433;Xa206a4cba;Xa531d3eca;Xa541fd580;Xa547d6fa6;Xa886620bb;Xac588df1a;Xb23a782a0;Xb2c3a92a2;Xb4521cfce;Xb4c99add3;Xb5bc5e5cd;Xb744868d3;Xb8528e6e1;Xbbf0772fa;Xbc9d7dfb4;Xbd1adcf05;Xbd629a685;Xbd926de8e;Xbd966e122;Xbda929cf4;Xc01213e6e;Xc404e4da1;Xc42d0e39e;Xc7ca49c9c;Xcbc300eae;Xcd028ba20;Xcd957d4ae;Xce6897ee1;Xcf997d29d;Xd09e44eda;Xd1ab167bc;Xd2d2b6711;Xd2df2f634;Xd7feb7c4f;Xd88772c81;Xd98ebb060;Xd9db113a6;Xda380f1ea;Xde4c34251;Xde4d46552;Xded166ee7;Xdf226d1eb;Xdfe151539;Xe1ed4d439;Xe2e25de84;Xe4291195c;Xe439b74fb;Xe6d952eab;Xe81694760;Xedd6016bb;Xf2dc5ba8e;Xf352b028f;Xf41c182e5;Xf43a89e3c;Xf64a847a1;Xf79ecb1f8;Xf7ca0d8f0;Xf959e818c;Xfa277918d;Xfb3228062;Xfe3e763ae,158,On Integrating Information Visualization Techniques into Data Mining: A Review,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00202,2015
286,"Time of flight cameras may emerge as the 3-D sensor of choice. Today, time of flight sensors use phase-based sampling, where the phase delay between emitted and received, high-frequency signals encodes distance. In this paper, we present a new time of flight architecture that relies only on frequency---we refer to this technique as frequency-domain time of flight (FD-TOF). Inspired by optical coherence tomography (OCT), FD-TOF excels when frequency bandwidth is high. With the increasing frequency of TOF sensors, new challenges to time of flight sensing continue to emerge. At high frequencies, FD-TOF offers several potential benefits over phase-based time of flight methods.","Kadambi, Achuta;Taamazyan, Vage;Jayasuriya, Suren;Raskar, Ramesh",ArXiv e-prints,"[55330acd33, X0067972df, X006e7323d, X007a3f654, X024ce162c, X04714dfbc, X047a11b4c, X04f8c7a88, X050614965, X054ed7f1f, X058aa6b6e, X0708d16b3, X07c4ec776, X07c56474a, X098fc45e7, X0bb750af4, X0cd4a8919, X11d145355, X1210894b2, X12fd150c9, X1381dc5e8, X1415d6e7d, X1732dd666, X1a8a09135, X1b6df7c87, X1c5245336, X1c9a59d8b, X1cbb0bd65, X1d7dab44f, X1e024e775, X1e7ab7492, X20129c991, X21cd19d88, X22bd6927d, X2748d40e1, X2780a74c9, X27a5f8557, X28282fc89, X28a2da0f0, X2a4a86f62, X2b21407b3, X2b5aed85d, X2c1d44158, X2d12d293a, X2d5617bfd, X2ef0dfe1d, X2f22c420c, X311e3e012, X31d0fa47b, X34bcfe16d, X35e8d4405, X38480000c, X39acf7a59, X39b3de5c8, X3b5fcaa6c, X40bac7884, X4359df365, X45e09dda9, X46de5627c, X48a77c0d1, X48bafa6eb, X49f3db7b2, X4a9f2c7ea, X4b578becd, X4b619f9bd, X4c4b3fe1c, X4e5586afa, X4f05bd13d, X4f38764f2, X50d708f43, X51537998f, X51584a7d5, X52244c401, X542bc0635, X549e8a565, X5532a1d8f, X56023cd2b, X57228d55f, X5722f35eb, X5803b8175, X58af12aaa, X593f8c8b1, X59c362c1f, X5a9b090a9, X5c67d020d, X5cc0e04c9, X5dca23608, X5f67c1783, X613beec36, X6270efe53, X64de6878a, X6588090ac, X65f410281, X65fa53b6b, X66013d41d, X664f249ae, X66795f7ba, X6822047b8, X692fd8af2, X6afd48ce0, ...]",55330acd33;X0067972df;X006e7323d;X007a3f654;X024ce162c;X04714dfbc;X047a11b4c;X04f8c7a88;X050614965;X054ed7f1f;X058aa6b6e;X0708d16b3;X07c4ec776;X07c56474a;X098fc45e7;X0bb750af4;X0cd4a8919;X11d145355;X1210894b2;X12fd150c9;X1381dc5e8;X1415d6e7d;X1732dd666;X1a8a09135;X1b6df7c87;X1c5245336;X1c9a59d8b;X1cbb0bd65;X1d7dab44f;X1e024e775;X1e7ab7492;X20129c991;X21cd19d88;X22bd6927d;X2748d40e1;X2780a74c9;X27a5f8557;X28282fc89;X28a2da0f0;X2a4a86f62;X2b21407b3;X2b5aed85d;X2c1d44158;X2d12d293a;X2d5617bfd;X2ef0dfe1d;X2f22c420c;X311e3e012;X31d0fa47b;X34bcfe16d;X35e8d4405;X38480000c;X39acf7a59;X39b3de5c8;X3b5fcaa6c;X40bac7884;X4359df365;X45e09dda9;X46de5627c;X48a77c0d1;X48bafa6eb;X49f3db7b2;X4a9f2c7ea;X4b578becd;X4b619f9bd;X4c4b3fe1c;X4e5586afa;X4f05bd13d;X4f38764f2;X50d708f43;X51537998f;X51584a7d5;X52244c401;X542bc0635;X549e8a565;X5532a1d8f;X56023cd2b;X57228d55f;X5722f35eb;X5803b8175;X58af12aaa;X593f8c8b1;X59c362c1f;X5a9b090a9;X5c67d020d;X5cc0e04c9;X5dca23608;X5f67c1783;X613beec36;X6270efe53;X64de6878a;X6588090ac;X65f410281;X65fa53b6b;X66013d41d;X664f249ae;X66795f7ba;X6822047b8;X692fd8af2;X6afd48ce0;X6e1ec04a9;X6e8501a44;X6fbdfa6d1;X70074cffa;X703c56a5b;X709de5f98;X7104b9b5a;X728f04e8b;X73f4a0f7e;X74fcfa7f7;X7652b69d9;X76670b6a0;X775e67102;X780930f20;X7a1238d43;X7a163054a;X7a318d1d3;X7bbb77ee1;X7c617eb34;X7da73b7ba;X7fe7bbbac;X82aeee83f;X84175837d;X8585c2be7;X88f882ecc;X893031a57;X8acd61040;X8d36d486a;X8dc92b1f0;X8dd439abf;X8e28e18c7;X9030c16e8;X9253f3915;X9310c8bc7;X9604546ba;X9b44255a1;X9b7457dff;X9b853e20a;X9c6e4e97a;X9ce96e79d;X9d8588c10;X9e4af6e2a;Xa00524190;Xa2224b2a6;Xa2f4368c1;Xa7b7859a7;Xaad1442c1;Xab54949c3;Xac825ea4e;Xac85a5ca3;Xaed5f7894;Xaf130304b;Xb18108d27;Xb33033d01;Xb3e47aa3f;Xb41d0d255;Xb4c99add3;Xb53e63629;Xb5c8db97d;Xb750dec0f;Xbaad9f2cf;Xbbef692dd;Xbd1adcf05;Xbd629a685;Xbd74722d2;Xc01213e6e;Xc112616d5;Xc340826a3;Xc500de16e;Xc5a8dea22;Xc65ff9fca;Xca0fc156d;Xcc9b41bd4;Xcd72fc8fd;Xcf997d29d;Xd0dd9e68f;Xd3f5971e6;Xd5dbc4e8e;Xdb30935b9;Xdb57b5c78;Xdb9ba1f30;Xdbcd9bfb3;Xdbd8a45b7;Xdd7e5d2e1;Xde1606e6b;Xde4d46552;Xdf2ba9c7f;Xdf82e0615;Xdffa8a5c3;Xe17df1700;Xe20904402;Xe86ef18c2;Xec3bbb48d;Xec506e294;Xef37408bf;Xef486b846;Xf20224116;Xf258635eb;Xf265ba46b;Xf3de584e9;Xf41c182e5;Xf5d0808b9;Xf7afbadbc;Xf8364a31d;Xf9bcd9f42;Xfa0e9efce;Xfba3d1cbb;Xfd5d23dee;Xfe7fb6d71,209,Frequency Domain TOF: Encoding Object Depth in Modulation Frequency,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01804,2015
287,"Separation of the text regions from background texture and graphics is an important step of any optical character recognition sytem for the images containg both texts and graphics. In this paper, we have presented a novel text/graphics separation technique for business card images captured with a cell-phone camera. At first, the background is eliminated at a coarse level based on intensity variance. This makes the foreground components distinct from each other. Then the non-text components are removed using various characteristic features of text and graphics. Finally, the text regions are skew corrected and binarized for further processing. Experimenting with business card images of various resolutions, we have found an optimum performance of 98.54% with 0.75 MP images, that takes 0.17 seconds processing time and 1.1 MB peak memory on a moderately powerful computer (DualCore 1.73 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 1 MB L2 Cache). The developed technique is computationally efficient and consumes low memory so as to be applicable on mobile devices.","Faruk Mollah, Ayatullah;Basu, Subhadip;Nasipuri, Mita;Basu, Dipak Kumar",ArXiv e-prints,"[X12faba0ed, X13fd931ff, X16b1d0ca8, X19327aab9, X1d18e9c76, X1ded625b5, X21dbea246, X2abe57279, X2b3c06f20, X2d30e376a, X30c60645d, X31429edfa, X33dcbb025, X378a992f1, X41cf59f15, X49acf06b4, X589eeaaf0, X5b0337f20, X5ba70127a, X62f0a5657, X6666555df, X66f00bcd6, X6de6300e1, X6f318001f, X70da77558, X719a78f39, X739db2f9f, X7bba1577e, X80ca7b273, X86129380f, X8b69a03da, X961f1e07f, X9703e21ba, Xa5919f569, Xa5e732b75, Xb7fc1a9d0, Xb8402d85c, Xc4f64fd2a, Xc7098c46f, Xc966534a4, Xca2a7ddd2, Xca4529454, Xcd424e211, Xd4d976b70, Xe39354034, Xebffea07e, Xec0a90ac1, Xef6d46a84, Xf2e273daa, Xf5fdf3d6c, Xfbd94d726, Xff7adfda2]",X12faba0ed;X13fd931ff;X16b1d0ca8;X19327aab9;X1d18e9c76;X1ded625b5;X21dbea246;X2abe57279;X2b3c06f20;X2d30e376a;X30c60645d;X31429edfa;X33dcbb025;X378a992f1;X41cf59f15;X49acf06b4;X589eeaaf0;X5b0337f20;X5ba70127a;X62f0a5657;X6666555df;X66f00bcd6;X6de6300e1;X6f318001f;X70da77558;X719a78f39;X739db2f9f;X7bba1577e;X80ca7b273;X86129380f;X8b69a03da;X961f1e07f;X9703e21ba;Xa5919f569;Xa5e732b75;Xb7fc1a9d0;Xb8402d85c;Xc4f64fd2a;Xc7098c46f;Xc966534a4;Xca2a7ddd2;Xca4529454;Xcd424e211;Xd4d976b70;Xe39354034;Xebffea07e;Xec0a90ac1;Xef6d46a84;Xf2e273daa;Xf5fdf3d6c;Xfbd94d726;Xff7adfda2,52,Text/Graphics Separation for Business Card Images for Mobile Devices,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0766,2010
288,"This work presents new methods and algorithms for tracking the shape and trajectory of moving reflecting obstacles with broken rays, or rays reflecting at an obstacle. While in tomography the focus of the reconstruction method is to recover the velocity structure of the domain, the shape and trajectory reconstruction procedure directly finds the shape and trajectory of the obstacle. The physical signal carrier for this innovative method are ultrasonic beams. When the speed of sound is constant, the rays are straight line segments and the shape and trajectory of moving objects will be reconstructed with methods based on the travel time equation and ellipsoid geometry. For variable speed of sound, we start with the eikonal equation and a system of differential equations that has its origins in acoustics and seismology. In this case, the rays are curves that are not necessarily straight line segments and we develop algorithms for shape and trajectory tracking based on the numerical solution of these equations. We present methods and algorithms for shape and trajectory tracking of moving obstacles with reflected rays when the location of the receiver of the reflected ray is not known in advance. The shape and trajectory tracking method is very efficient because it is not necessary for the reflected signal to traverse the whole domain or the same path back to the transmitter. It could be received close to the point of reflection or far away from the transmitter. This optimizes the energy spent by transmitters for tracking the object, reduces signal attenuation and improves image resolution. It is a safe and secure method. We also present algorithms for tracking the shape and trajectory of absorbing obstacles. The new methods and algorithms for shape and trajectory tracking enable new applications and an application to one-hop Internet routing is presented.","Lozev, Kamen",ArXiv e-prints,"[X654b5d8d1, X887ff80f3, Xd1f30b564]",X654b5d8d1;X887ff80f3;Xd1f30b564,3,Shape and Trajectory Tracking of Moving Obstacles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6321,2011
289,"Expression cloning plays an important role in facial expression synthesis. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed for facial expression cloning. The proposed algorithm first introduces a new elastic model to balance the global and local warping effects, such that the impacts from facial feature diversity among people can be minimized, and thus more effective geometric warping results can be achieved. Furthermore, a muscle-distribution-based (MD) model is proposed, which utilizes the muscle distribution of the human face and results in more accurate facial illumination details. In addition, we also propose a new distance-based metric to automatically select the optimal parameters such that the global and local warping effects in the elastic model can be suitably balanced. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods.","Zhang, Yihao;Lin, Weiyao;Zhou, Bing;Chen, Zhenzhong;Sheng, Bin;Wu, Jianxin;Zhang, Wenjun",ArXiv

290,"This paper describes a novel approach to partially reconstruct high-resolution 4D light fields from a stack of differently focused photographs taken with a fixed camera. First, a focus map is calculated from this stack using a simple approach combining gradient detection and region expansion with graph-cut. Then, this focus map is converted into a depth map thanks to the calibration of the camera. We proceed after this with the tomographic reconstruction of the epipolar images by back-projecting the focused regions of the scene only. We call it masked back-projection. The angles of back-projection are calculated from the depth map. Thanks to the high angular resolution we achieve by suitably exploiting the image content captured over a large interval of focus distances, we are able to render puzzling perspective shifts although the original photographs were taken from a single fixed camera at a fixed position.","Mousnier, A.;Vural, E.;Guillemot, C.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0067972df, X007a3f654, X058aa6b6e, X099b8ca07, X0b559beb5, X0bb750af4, X109c508f9, X11857df50, X158aa546f, X16628a179, X1a8a09135, X1b6df7c87, X1c5245336, X1ebd2adcd, X242ec5d87, X25bd6525e, X269b73785, X2748d40e1, X277ae23c3, X28a2da0f0, X28a64d4ba, X2b20f75ca, X2b5aed85d, X2ca7c9a93, X2d5617bfd, X2ef0dfe1d, X2fa33fb96, X32678eddf, X34014dcb6, X349945c9e, X34b901e06, X393087a9e, X3a0b53c88, X3b5fcaa6c, X3c6509cb1, X3f2b86c79, X437d77c73, X46de5627c, X482a01182, X48a77c0d1, X48bafa6eb, X48f56a084, X49f3db7b2, X4a9f2c7ea, X4c4b3fe1c, X50d708f43, X549e8a565, X54d66ccfa, X5532a1d8f, X5542d2761, X56d07593c, X5722f35eb, X57cb22f52, X58af12aaa, X5d1dfcbb1, X5ff524823, X613beec36, X644bf8812, X6588090ac, X66013d41d, X664f249ae, X692fd8af2, X6a11c7ee6, X6d9b7f3de, X6e8501a44, X70074cffa, X703c56a5b, X71b1a2efa, X728f04e8b, X73f4a0f7e, X74fcfa7f7, X7652b69d9, X78c4096f4, X78d6c882d, X7a1238d43, X7abbe6ddd, X7da73b7ba, X7ef0e7dcd, X851a46f23, X870d4ebb3, X87c09cc0f, X8c446fdca, X8cfb1f02f, X8dd439abf, X8f158ef01, X9030c16e8, X91aadd329, X92701c523, X92b5f63a2, X95d90c09c, X9660c73cc, X973bce71d, X99270457f, X998f6958d, X9a0a0345a, X9b853e20a, X9c6e4e97a, X9ce96e79d, Xa02827b36, Xaaa16db96, ...]",X0067972df;X007a3f654;X058aa6b6e;X099b8ca07;X0b559beb5;X0bb750af4;X109c508f9;X11857df50;X158aa546f;X16628a179;X1a8a09135;X1b6df7c87;X1c5245336;X1ebd2adcd;X242ec5d87;X25bd6525e;X269b73785;X2748d40e1;X277ae23c3;X28a2da0f0;X28a64d4ba;X2b20f75ca;X2b5aed85d;X2ca7c9a93;X2d5617bfd;X2ef0dfe1d;X2fa33fb96;X32678eddf;X34014dcb6;X349945c9e;X34b901e06;X393087a9e;X3a0b53c88;X3b5fcaa6c;X3c6509cb1;X3f2b86c79;X437d77c73;X46de5627c;X482a01182;X48a77c0d1;X48bafa6eb;X48f56a084;X49f3db7b2;X4a9f2c7ea;X4c4b3fe1c;X50d708f43;X549e8a565;X54d66ccfa;X5532a1d8f;X5542d2761;X56d07593c;X5722f35eb;X57cb22f52;X58af12aaa;X5d1dfcbb1;X5ff524823;X613beec36;X644bf8812;X6588090ac;X66013d41d;X664f249ae;X692fd8af2;X6a11c7ee6;X6d9b7f3de;X6e8501a44;X70074cffa;X703c56a5b;X71b1a2efa;X728f04e8b;X73f4a0f7e;X74fcfa7f7;X7652b69d9;X78c4096f4;X78d6c882d;X7a1238d43;X7abbe6ddd;X7da73b7ba;X7ef0e7dcd;X851a46f23;X870d4ebb3;X87c09cc0f;X8c446fdca;X8cfb1f02f;X8dd439abf;X8f158ef01;X9030c16e8;X91aadd329;X92701c523;X92b5f63a2;X95d90c09c;X9660c73cc;X973bce71d;X99270457f;X998f6958d;X9a0a0345a;X9b853e20a;X9c6e4e97a;X9ce96e79d;Xa02827b36;Xaaa16db96;Xaad1442c1;Xaed5f7894;Xaf48f9983;Xb0c0f7098;Xb5c8db97d;Xb7800f2a9;Xb7e762f4b;Xbb6d9bb83;Xbd629a685;Xc01213e6e;Xc723807c1;Xc8ccb6c55;Xca322c83c;Xd0dd9e68f;Xd0f6b1743;Xd13eda95c;Xd9eafcca0;Xdb9ba1f30;Xdbfedb317;Xde4d46552;Xdf2ba9c7f;Xe89ad474d;Xe8eae89fd;Xec8fcf32e;Xeff76bbeb;Xf21765a16;Xf265ba46b;Xf3de584e9;Xf41c182e5;Xf782e1772;Xf7afbadbc;Xf8dbb8336,132,Partial light field tomographic reconstruction from a fixed-camera focal stack,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01903,2015
291,"This paper presents the Deep Convolution Inverse Graphics Network (DC-IGN) that aims to learn an interpretable representation of images that is disentangled with respect to various transformations such as object out-of-plane rotations, lighting variations, and texture. The DC-IGN model is composed of multiple layers of convolution and de-convolution operators and is trained using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) algorithm. We propose training procedures to encourage neurons in the graphics code layer to have semantic meaning and force each group to distinctly represent a specific transformation (pose,light,texture,shape etc.). Given a static face image, our model can re-generate the input image with different pose, lighting or even texture and shape variations from the base face. We present qualitative and quantitative results of the model's efficacy to learn a 3D rendering engine. Moreover, we also utilize the learnt representation for two important visual recognition tasks: (1) an invariant face recognition task and (2) using the representation as a summary statistic for generative modeling.","Kulkarni, Tejas D.;Whitney, Will;Kohli, Pushmeet;Tenenbaum, Joshua B.",ArXiv e-prints,"[550c54f1fb, 552ca7a99a, 5530105be3, 55387150c3, X000bc1d6b, X004412374, X00519a620,

292,"The main theme of this workshop (Dagstuhl seminar 04351) is `Spatial Representation: Continuous vs. Discrete'. Spatial representation has two contrasting but interacting aspects (i) representation of spaces' and (ii) representation by spaces. In this paper, we will examine two aspects that are common to both interpretations of the theme, namely nerve constructions and refinement. Representations change, data changes, spaces change. We will examine the possibility of a `differential geometry' of spatial representations of both types, and in the sequel give an algebra of differential forms that has the potential to handle the dynamical aspect of such a geometry. We will discuss briefly a conjectured class of spaces, generalising the Cantor set which would seem ideal as a test-bed for the set of tools we are developing.","Gratus, Jonathan;Porter, Timothy",ArXiv e-prints,"[X2a4f194fe, X7624a98da, Xaaffbcf86, Xb9155cd9b, Xc904086ac, Xccfecc8c6, Xd2c954110, Xfc4c0bc9a]",X2a4f194fe;X7624a98da;Xaaffbcf86;Xb9155cd9b;Xc904086ac;Xccfecc8c6;Xd2c954110;Xfc4c0bc9a,8,"A geometry of information, I: Nerves, posets and differential forms",http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0512010,2005
293,"We present a flexible illustrative line style model for the visualization of streamline data. Our model partitions view-oriented line strips into parallel bands whose basic visual properties can be controlled independently. We thus extend previous line stylization techniques specifically for visualization purposes by allowing the parametrization of these bands based on the local line data attributes. Moreover, our approach supports emphasis and abstraction by introducing line style transfer functions that map local line attribute values to complete line styles. With a flexible GPU implementation of this line style model we enable the interactive exploration of visual representations of streamlines. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by applying it to 3D flow field datasets.","Everts, Maarten H.;Bekker, Henk;Roerdink, Jos B. T.

294,"In this paper we address the problem of interpolating a spline developable patch bounded by a given spline curve and the first and the last rulings of the developable surface. In order to complete the boundary of the patch a second spline curve is to be given. Up to now this interpolation problem could be solved, but without the possibility of choosing both endpoints for the rulings. We circumvent such difficulty here by resorting to degree elevation of the developable surface. This is useful not only to solve this problem, but also other problems dealing with triangular developable patches.","Cantón, A.;Fernández-Jambrina, L.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0075c8b52, X0238297fe, X08efc5319, X13f9f05a0, X14ecfa0df, X1db65af73, X28635496f, X28a2da0f0, X2bd414e0b, X2ef0dfe1d, X3b5fcaa6c, X41b9064b8, X41f8a2804, X436d765c7, X450853ca8, X4b619f9bd, X526ac2621, X613beec36, X6588090ac, X6ab8d94e2, X6c9a3e65f, X6d8ac597d, X6df12f763, X71350c776, X7f4011c2c, X8bc67cba7, X928daeea3, X96a2cd00d, X971c5f21f, X98b11f666, Xa6d483dd2, Xae15b2ffd, Xc1f6bbbf5, Xca28b6fd5, Xd97e99cc8, Xddf66c7c1, Xdffea6849, Xec3be214a, Xeeebf1282]",X0075c8b52;X0238297fe;X08efc5319;X13f9f05a0;X14ecfa0df;X1db65af73;X28635496f;X28a2da0f0;X2bd414e0b;X2ef0dfe1d;X3b5fcaa6c;X41b9064b8;X41f8a2804;X436d765c7;X450853ca8;X4b619f9bd;X526ac2621;X613beec36;X6588090ac;X6ab8d94e2;X6c9a3e65f;X6d8ac597d;X6df12f763;X71350c776;X7f4011c2c;X8bc67cba7;X928daeea3;X96a2cd00d;X971c5f21f;X98b11f666;Xa6d483dd2;Xae15b2ffd;Xc1f6bbbf5;Xca28b6fd5;Xd97e99cc8;Xddf66c7c1;Xdffea6849;Xec3be214a;Xeeebf1282,39,Interpolation of a spline developable surface between a curve and two rulings,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06995,2015
295,"Computer animation in the past decade has become one of the most noticeable features of technology-based learning environments. With today's high educational demands as well as the lack of time provided for certain courses, classical educational methods have shown deficiencies in keeping up with the drastic changes observed in the digital era. Without taking into account various significant factors such as gender, age, level of interest and memory level, educational animation may turn out to be insufficient for learners or fail to meet their needs. However, we have noticed that the applications of animation for education have been given only inadequate attention, and students' personality types have never been taken into account. We suggest there is an interesting relationship here, and propose essential factors in creating educational animations based on students' personality types. Particularly, we investigate how information in computer animation may be presented in a preferable way based on the fundamental elements of computer animation. The present study believes that it is likely to have wide benefits in the field of education. Considering the personality types in designing educational computer animations with the aid of gathered empirical results might be a promising avenue to enhance the learning process.","Musa, Sajid;Ziatdinov, Rushan;Faruk Sozcu, Omer;Griffiths, Carol",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0238297fe, X0390a0313, X06d1cd1cf, X07348362f, X07a0d327c, X07fd19f40, X08020cd9f, X08efc5319, X0948d85e7, X0a2e9b95e, X0bce31a0b, X0d4ef540f, X1074e1173, X11a89fdac, X13891c0ae, X14ecfa0df, X162d362a0, X1a5476700, X1b2409826, X1e84cbe03, X204cd7bf6, X20cd13e65, X21c91a851, X24475cd66, X24e8b4e49, X267f33dc0, X272842d09, X28635496f, X28a2da0f0, X2b1bc8f5a, X2bd414e0b, X2ce162733, X3847adde2, X3b5fcaa6c, X3be0bb164, X3c30d5d00, X3db3543be, X4008ec009, X4b619f9bd, X4c029e95c, X4ffdf2455, X520daff39, X55ea03df7, X56f6d6fdd, X575136dda, X589897f15, X598bb412b, X5c2c5afc4, X5c89aad21, X5d4fa36c6, X613beec36, X6588090ac, X6ab8d94e2, X6f3544341, X701f08843, X71350c776, X7a1238d43, X7f3272565, X7f4aef04f, X7f534c7b2, X7f7edfcc2, X8533076f2, X8606e50ba, X875783253, X8878f8386, X892b122d4, X8d188313a, X8dfaf6b5d, X8e087a058, X909acb897, X94d85c332, X96a2cd00d, X9cca94367, X9d3052a3d, X9fd3e2a8a, Xa050847fe, Xa0bc84a7e, Xa0ffc2221, Xa60ea3d3b, Xa6d483dd2, Xad42f737a, Xae1f9edf8, Xaf3029960, Xb1832ba6d, Xb629c9085, Xb8da05ad9, Xbd2e72698, Xbe895c90a, Xbec2808b6, Xc097824a9, Xc20d562d1, Xc3899f886, Xc88f07a84, Xc933dea54, Xca28b6fd5, Xcd16743d9, Xd5d867a69, Xd5e0aa6e3, Xd97e99cc8, Xdacadf053, ...]",X0238297fe;X0390a0313;X06d1cd1cf;X07348362f;X07a0d327c;X07fd19f40;X08020cd9f;X08efc5319;X0948d85e7;X0a2e9b95e;X0bce31a0b;X0d4ef540f;X1074e1173;X11a89fdac;X13891c0ae;X14ecfa0df;X162d362a0;X1a5476700;X1b2409826;X1e84cbe03;X204cd7bf6;X20cd13e65;X21c91a851;X24475cd66;X24e8b4e49;X267f33dc0;X272842d09;X28635496f;X28a2da0f0;X2b1bc8f5a;X2bd414e0b;X2ce162733;X3847adde2;X3b5fcaa6c;X3be0bb164;X3c30d5d00;X3db3543be;X4008ec009;X4b619f9bd;X4c029e95c;X4ffdf2455;X520daff39;X55ea03df7;X56f6d6fdd;X575136dda;X589897f15;X598bb412b;X5c2c5afc4;X5c89aad21;X5d4fa36c6;X613beec36;X6588090ac;X6ab8d94e2;X6f3544341;X701f08843;X71350c776;X7a1238d43;X7f3272565;X7f4aef04f;X7f534c7b2;X7f7edfcc2;X8533076f2;X8606e50ba;X875783253;X8878f8386;X892b122d4;X8d188313a;X8dfaf6b5d;X8e087a058;X909acb897;X94d85c332;X96a2cd00d;X9cca94367;X9d3052a3d;X9fd3e2a8a;Xa050847fe;Xa0bc84a7e;Xa0ffc2221;Xa60ea3d3b;Xa6d483dd2;Xad42f737a;Xae1f9edf8;Xaf3029960;Xb1832ba6d;Xb629c9085;Xb8da05ad9;Xbd2e72698;Xbe895c90a;Xbec2808b6;Xc097824a9;Xc20d562d1;Xc3899f886;Xc88f07a84;Xc933dea54;Xca28b6fd5;Xcd16743d9;Xd5d867a69;Xd5e0aa6e3;Xd97e99cc8;Xdacadf053;Xdbe473796;Xdc9afb10e;Xddf66c7c1;Xe31810946;Xe39b99166;Xe66eccf49;Xe731e9ada;Xec14207a0;Xf02073243;Xf2169dbac;Xf291f578f;Xf5a83abcf;Xf805a14e7;Xfd597eae7;Xffb01b623;Xffefc3366,116,Developing Educational Computer Animation Based on Human Personality Types,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06958,2015

Autoplot has proven to be a flexible tool for exploring, accessing, and viewing data resources as typically found on the web, usually in the form of a directory containing data files with multiple parameters contained in each file. Data from a data source is abstracted into a common internal data model called QDataSet. Autoplot is built from individually useful components, and can be extended and reused to create specialized data handling and analysis applications and is being used in a variety of science visualization and analysis applications.

298,"Morphing is the process of changing one figure into another. Some numerical methods of 3D surface morphing by deformable modeling and conformal mapping are shown in this study. It is well known that there exists a unique Riemann conformal mapping from a simply connected surface into a unit disk by the Riemann mapping theorem. The dilation and relative orientations of the 3D surfaces can be linked through the M\""obius transformation due to the conformal characteristic of the Riemann mapping. On the other hand, a 3D surface deformable model can be built via various approaches such as mutual parameterization from direct interpolation or surface matching using landmarks. In this paper, we take the advantage of the unique representation of 3D surfaces by the mean curvatures and the conformal factors associated with the Riemann mapping. By registering the landmarks on the conformal parametric domains, the correspondence of the mean curvatures and the conformal factors for each surfaces can be obtained. As a result, we can construct the 3D deformation field from the surface reconstruction algorithm proposed by Gu and Yau. Furthermore, by composition of the M\""obius transformation and the 3D deformation field, the morphing sequence can be generated from the mean curvatures and the conformal factors on a unified mesh structure by using the cubic spline homotopy. Several numerical experiments of the face morphing are presented to demonstrate the robustness of our approach.","Yueh, Mei-Heng;Gu, Xianfeng David;Lin, Wen-Wei;Wu, Chin-Tien;Yau, Shing-Tung",ArXiv e-prints,"[X04c76461f, X0518cad03, X0552ae350, X075ccf31a, X0b51ecf87, X0b559beb5, X0f7f8762c, X1132ac075, X12e3b4a98, X13a5d66bf, X1400957eb, X147c60e12, X172add237, X194f0aca8, X19f754376, X205ba3058, X22c086512, X24c156427, X26cb07366, X2a8c1596c, X2c0a6abe0, X2ccd26e36, X2ce46d528, X2d6a54800, X2dd1d040e, X2ef0dfe1d, X2f00f810b, X306cbfb54, X3731f6811, X396bc00f4, X3af01d022, X3bbc68f6e, X3d70ecd89, X3df06a147, X3f82c45ef, X3fc7c1a50, X45877e8c1, X46c39dcee, X47c338017, X47edc13bc, X4879ac23e, X4a05e52af, X4b72dd236, X4c4fdf38d, X4cdf20b3f, X4ce718d76, X4e640ce8b, X4fccd9049, X51584a7d5, X526ac2621, X533875158, X56957a642, X576fc2ce8, X5a51ba639, X5a9e93ed4, X5b9a49342, X5e8ae6126, X5ff8313ce, X604405840, X604bce283, X613beec36, X62753567c, X63bf51ef5, X6588090ac, X6861f88e7, X6a42210a3, X6a7c6c5e9, X6a893f35f, X6b2d49f5c, X6be289394, X6d3036b24, X6d836b217, X71c8e73cc, X722e763a4, X73983136c, X74013eb80, X74e8fd4cc, X750734641, X75baaf6ac, X78c4096f4, X7f7055b6d, X82489168c, X840391a50, X84b5b6438, X85930689c, X8c43cc7f6, X8e8304790, X9338c5c98, X9745a764a, X97bf2236e, X9881363ba, X99fa40989, X9a6d774e0, X9cfc4317d, X9e663f355, X9f861e350, Xa25a6fb14, Xa797a288f, Xa87302ca2, Xaf2b170fd, ...]",X04c76461f;X0518cad03;X0552ae350;X075ccf31a;X0b51ecf87;X0b559beb5;X0f7f8762c;X1132ac075;X12e3b4a98;X13a5d66bf;X1400957eb;X147c60e12;X172add237;X194f0aca8;X19f754376;X205ba3058;X22c086512;X24c156427;X26cb07366;X2a8c1596c;X2c0a6abe0;X2ccd26e36;X2ce46d528;X2d6a54800;X2dd1d040e;X2ef0dfe1d;X2f00f810b;X306cbfb54;X3731f6811;X396bc00f4;X3af01d022;X3bbc68f6e;X3d70ecd89;X3df06a147;X3f82c45ef;X3fc7c1a50;X45877e8c1;X46c39dcee;X47c338017;X47edc13bc;X4879ac23e;X4a05e52af;X4b72dd236;X4c4fdf38d;X4cdf20b3f;X4ce718d76;X4e640ce8b;X4fccd9049;X51584a7d5;X526ac2621;X533875158;X56957a642;X576fc2ce8;X5a51ba639;X5a9e93ed4;X5b9a49342;X5e8ae6126;X5ff8313ce;X604405840;X604bce283;X613beec36;X62753567c;X63bf51ef5;X6588090ac;X6861f88e7;X6a42210a3;X6a7c6c5e9;X6a893f35f;X6b2d49f5c;X6be289394;X6d3036b24;X6d836b217;X71c8e73cc;X722e763a4;X73983136c;X74013eb80;X74e8fd4cc;X750734641;X75baaf6ac;X78c4096f4;X7f7055b6d;X82489168c;X840391a50;X84b5b6438;X85930689c;X8c43cc7f6;X8e8304790;X9338c5c98;X9745a764a;X97bf2236e;X9881363ba;X99fa40989;X9a6d774e0;X9cfc4317d;X9e663f355;X9f861e350;Xa25a6fb14;Xa797a288f;Xa87302ca2;Xaf2b170fd;Xb05ccdce2;Xb4d3d9f8c;Xb5f7188bf;Xb6c5ea765;Xb71074f55;Xbbb6ab754;Xbc0c44be2;Xbdac7a611;Xbe4e39122;Xbf3e9cb09;Xc01213e6e;Xc1054d9f6;Xc19fccef4;Xc1dbd9fbb;Xc809bb214;Xc8f6bf80a;Xc9da4f352;Xcb5c7b5c7;Xcbcdac8d9;Xd1909851a;Xd84ff8e16;Xd92c2ec87;Xd97e99cc8;Xd9e05295f;Xdf2b835f7;Xdf4f95aae;Xdfeb0fca9;Xe09905de8;Xe221007e7;Xe5583a1e7;Xe66eccf49;Xe8960466b;Xf3b0950f2;Xf51da60a9;Xf56b834e3;Xfb9330f20;Xffa9283e1;Xfff488885,138,Conformal Surface Morphing with Applications on Facial Expressions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00097,2015

300,"This paper presents innovative algorithms to efficiently compute erosions and dilations of run-length encoded (RLE) binary images with arbitrary shaped structuring elements. An RLE image is given by a set of runs, where a run is a horizontal concatenation of foreground pixels. The proposed algorithms extract the skeleton of the structuring element and build distance tables of the input image, which are storing the distance to the next background pixel on the left and right hand sides. This information is then used to speed up the calculations of the erosion and dilation operator by enabling the use of techniques which allow to skip the analysis of certain pixels whenever a hit or miss occurs. Additionally the input image gets trimmed during the preprocessing steps on the base of two primitive criteria. Experimental results show the advantages over other algorithms.

302,"This paper presents a graph bundling algorithm that agglomerates edges taking into account both spatial proximity as well as user-defined criteria in order to reveal patterns that were not perceivable with previous bundling techniques. Each edge belongs to a group that may either be an input of the problem or found by clustering one or more edge properties such as origin, destination, orientation, length or domain-specific properties. Bundling is driven by a stack of density maps, with each map capturing both the edge density of a given group as well as interactions with edges from other groups. Density maps are efficiently calculated by smoothing 2D histograms of edge occurrence using repeated averaging filters based on integral images. A CPU implementation of the algorithm is tested on several graphs, and different grouping criteria are used to illustrate how the proposed technique can render different visualizations of the same data. Bundling performance is much higher than on previous approaches, being particularly noticeable on large graphs, with millions of edges being bundled in seconds.","Moura, Daniel C.",ArXiv e-prints,"[54a5fb8be8, 552fa27fd4, 55363efffa, X043aee2e6, X050ea014e, X08595a2a3, X0b559beb5, X0c471e80a, X11fa2056d, X153417f3d, X17ed92288, X194f0aca8, X1bbbd8613, X231340468, X259b7a172, X2bc2e6041, X2ef0dfe1d, X3017b5fe0, X320909770, X3398f46a3, X352608034, X38a0e3a52, X41810df24, X42345df31, X4248f47dd, X46de5627c, X508f4c043, X5a51ba639, X5bab8c785, X5c128a5bc, X5f4fc3ba4, X5fc2f7b48, X613beec36, X6588090ac, X660874d85, X66827a9ca, X67f6ec7fa, X6f3ca6fc3, X7f2482527, X97a03699d, X99cbd7592, X9b59e76c2, X9c6db04f4, X9c8e43f43, X9d1be04b9, Xa28d67c1d, Xa474b43f5, Xa612350de, Xacc9251f2, Xae983b1fa, Xc209909d4, Xc48b05d25, Xc81a814a8, Xc9c01b76d, Xcb48dd98d, Xcce62715c, Xcf4d6e48c, Xd2e1c0b2c, Xd97630ac6, Xeb85f2dc7, Xed38d2965, Xf0cbb59be, Xf16db7670, Xf3eaf648a, Xf41c182e5, Xf7eec358b, Xf84ccd163, Xfad158c7f, Xfe30f7e25, Xfe9de2014]",54a5fb8be8;552fa27fd4;55363efffa;X043aee2e6;X050ea014e;X08595a2a3;X0b559beb5;X0c471e80a;X11fa2056d;X153417f3d;X17ed92288;X194f0aca8;X1bbbd8613;X231340468;X259b7a172;X2bc2e6041;X2ef0dfe1d;X3017b5fe0;X320909770;X3398f46a3;X352608034;X38a0e3a52;X41810df24;X42345df31;X4248f47dd;X46de5627c;X508f4c043;X5a51ba639;X5bab8c785;X5c128a5bc;X5f4fc3ba4;X5fc2f7b48;X613beec36;X6588090ac;X660874d85;X66827a9ca;X67f6ec7fa;X6f3ca6fc3;X7f2482527;X97a03699d;X99cbd7592;X9b59e76c2;X9c6db04f4;X9c8e43f43;X9d1be04b9;Xa28d67c1d;Xa474b43f5;Xa612350de;Xacc9251f2;Xae983b1fa;Xc209909d4;Xc48b05d25;Xc81a814a8;Xc9c01b76d;Xcb48dd98d;Xcce62715c;Xcf4d6e48c;Xd2e1c0b2c;Xd97630ac6;Xeb85f2dc7;Xed38d2965;Xf0cbb59be;Xf16db7670;Xf3eaf648a;Xf41c182e5;Xf7eec358b;Xf84ccd163;Xfad158c7f;Xfe30f7e25;Xfe9de2014,70,3D Density Histograms for Criteria-driven Edge Bundling,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02687,2015

304,"This work introduces a novel tool for interactive, real-time transformations of two dimensional IFS fractals. We assign barycentric coordinates (relative to an arbitrary affine basis of $\mathbb{R}^2$) to the points that constitute the image of a fractal. The tool uses some of the nice properties of the barycentric coordinates, enabling any affine transformation of the basis, done by click-and-drag, to be immediately followed by the same affine transformation of the IFS fractal attractor. In order to have a better control over the fractal, as affine basis we use a kind of minimal simplex that contains the attractor. We give theoretical grounds of the tool and then the software application.","Hadzieva, Elena;Shuminoska, Marija",ArXiv e-prints,"[552fa29377, X050ea014e, X08595a2a3, X08614c717, X0b559beb5, X0baa8ee4e, X17ed92288, X24c156427, X259b7a172, X299bca4e8, X2ef0dfe1d, X3538da58f, X36fb97a09, X3b5fcaa6c, X4248f47dd, X533d86bad, X57228d55f, X5c128a5bc, X5ff8313ce, X613beec36, X62dfcf612, X62e75bbd7, X6588090ac, X66d6388d3, X734bef608, X735e5b93b, X76ac5cc2f, X7f2482527, X851a46f23, X8f1f75779, X99cbd7592, X9b59e76c2, X9c6db04f4, Xa2499fcb1, Xa7856da67, Xaac559caf, Xb97426630, Xbc26cf235, Xc3db24b67, Xc723807c1, Xc9de81d10, Xcb48dd98d, Xcce62715c, Xd1f30b564, Xd471bb8af, Xdb6d14e60, Xdeff8429f, Xeecc05476, Xf0cbb59be, Xf16db7670, Xf41c182e5, Xf7eec358b, Xfbc5b8689, Xfe30f7e25]",552fa29377;X050ea014e;X08595a2a3;X08614c717;X0b559beb5;X0baa8ee4e;X17ed92288;X24c156427;X259b7a172;X299bca4e8;X2ef0dfe1d;X3538da58f;X36fb97a09;X3b5fcaa6c;X4248f47dd;X533d86bad;X57228d55f;X5c128a5bc;X5ff8313ce;X613beec36;X62dfcf612;X62e75bbd7;X6588090ac;X66d6388d3;X734bef608;X735e5b93b;X76ac5cc2f;X7f2482527;X851a46f23;X8f1f75779;X99cbd7592;X9b59e76c2;X9c6db04f4;Xa2499fcb1;Xa7856da67;Xaac559caf;Xb97426630;Xbc26cf235;Xc3db24b67;Xc723807c1;Xc9de81d10;Xcb48dd98d;Xcce62715c;Xd1f30b564;Xd471bb8af;Xdb6d14e60;Xdeff8429f;Xeecc05476;Xf0cbb59be;Xf16db7670;Xf41c182e5;Xf7eec358b;Xfbc5b8689;Xfe30f7e25,54,Real-time Tool for Affine Transformations of Two Dimensional IFS Fractals,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02744,2015
305,"A discrete rotation algorithm can be apprehended as a parametric application $f\_\alpha$ from $\ZZ[i]$ to $\ZZ[i]$, whose resulting permutation ``looks like'' the map induced by an Euclidean rotation. For this kind of algorithm, to be incremental means to compute successively all the intermediate rotate d copies of an image for angles in-between 0 and a destination angle. The di scretized rotation consists in the composition of an Euclidean rotation with a discretization; the aim of this article is to describe an algorithm whic h computes incrementally a discretized rotation. The suggested method uses o nly integer arithmetic and does not compute any sine nor any cosine. More pr ecisely, its design relies on the analysis of the discretized rotation as a step function: the precise description of the discontinuities turns to be th e key ingredient that will make the resulting procedure optimally fast and e xact. A complete description of the incremental rotation process is provided, also this result may be useful in the specification of a consistent set of defin itions for discrete geometry.","Nouvel, Bertrand;Remila, Eric",ArXiv e-prints,[],,0,Incremental and Transitive Discrete Rotations,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0512070,2005

308,"Wide-angle images gained a huge popularity in the last years due to the development of computational photography and imaging technological advances. They present the information of a scene in a way which is more natural for the human eye but, on the other hand, they introduce artifacts such as bent lines. These artifacts become more and more unnatural as the field of view increases. In this work, we present a technique aimed to improve the perceptual quality of panorama visualization. The main ingredients of our approach are, on one hand, considering the viewing sphere as a Riemann sphere, what makes natural the application of M\""obius (complex) transformations to the input image, and, on the other hand, a projection scheme which changes in function of the field of view used. We also introduce an implementation of our method, compare it against images produced with other methods and show that the transformations can be done in real-time, which makes our technique very appealing for new settings, as well as for existing interactive panorama applications.","Peñaranda, Luis;Velho, Luiz;Sacht, Leonardo",ArXiv e-prints,"[X020b71a51, X0262462fb, X0286432d2, X036b01730, X05f3483e7, X06151fc5e, X0e7b1a43f, X1400957eb, X1415d6e7d, X193a40f53, X1b7bc1557, X1bb3bba32, X20fa345db, X21cd19d88, X22a7c457d, X231a17150, X259b7a172, X25b2669e8, X2b43b9966, X2ef0dfe1d, X38411e57a, X3b5955009, X3b5fcaa6c, X3bfb2b214, X3cdfc35de, X3d65c9a09, X42345df31, X46de5627c, X4a541115e, X4bd080f36, X4d5039e7a, X4f351d55f, X533d86bad, X593f8c8b1, X6235fae48, X629ea8376, X656033cc9, X6588090ac, X6b5eb00dc, X6b77d3666, X6cf3ba513, X6f1225a01, X70957f7dc, X73ad9ac80, X74013eb80, X7a8933c50, X7ca7b3961, X7e47cf613, X7f2482527, X7f25e4b47, X825e848e0, X83ca4f85d, X8478772b3, X87e8eed2d, X882ee801a, X91aa1e2d0, X9881363ba, X997e03c0f, X9d8588c10, Xa10a4bcda, Xb4c99add3, Xb53e63629, Xb69359cf8, Xb788eb4d2, Xb967ffaa7, Xbb2c3216c, Xbffc1ce2f, Xc01213e6e, Xc0dbc876f, Xc4f75e87d, Xc65ff9fca, Xc6c873840, Xc8ab5c136, Xc8c6f4219, Xc9ad2f1fd, Xceefd5195, Xd248428af, Xd4fdcd33a, Xdb487f32d, Xdcee7162c, Xdf44403ba, Xe77cd2f57, Xe9f8b369f, Xed82b6537, Xedbdadbee, Xf16db7670, Xf41c182e5, Xf4454c841, Xf75d11922, Xfe194e884, Xfeda96803, Xffdbe7e52]",X020b71a51;X0262462fb;X0286432d2;X036b01730;X05f3483e7;X06151fc5e;X0e7b1a43f;X1400957eb;X1415d6e7d;X193a40f53;X1b7bc1557;X1bb3bba32;X20fa345db;X21cd19d88;X22a7c457d;X231a17150;X259b7a172;X25b2669e8;X2b43b9966;X2ef0dfe1d;X38411e57a;X3b5955009;X3b5fcaa6c;X3bfb2b214;X3cdfc35de;X3d65c9a09;X42345df31;X46de5627c;X4a541115e;X4bd080f36;X4d5039e7a;X4f351d55f;X533d86bad;X593f8c8b1;X6235fae48;X629ea8376;X656033cc9;X6588090ac;X6b5eb00dc;X6b77d3666;X6cf3ba513;X6f1225a01;X70957f7dc;X73ad9ac80;X74013eb80;X7a8933c50;X7ca7b3961;X7e47cf613;X7f2482527;X7f25e4b47;X825e848e0;X83ca4f85d;X8478772b3;X87e8eed2d;X882ee801a;X91aa1e2d0;X9881363ba;X997e03c0f;X9d8588c10;Xa10a4bcda;Xb4c99add3;Xb53e63629;Xb69359cf8;Xb788eb4d2;Xb967ffaa7;Xbb2c3216c;Xbffc1ce2f;Xc01213e6e;Xc0dbc876f;Xc4f75e87d;Xc65ff9fca;Xc6c873840;Xc8ab5c136;Xc8c6f4219;Xc9ad2f1fd;Xceefd5195;Xd248428af;Xd4fdcd33a;Xdb487f32d;Xdcee7162c;Xdf44403ba;Xe77cd2f57;Xe9f8b369f;Xed82b6537;Xedbdadbee;Xf16db7670;Xf41c182e5;Xf4454c841;Xf75d11922;Xfe194e884;Xfeda96803;Xffdbe7e52,92,"Real-time correction of panoramic images using hyperbolic M\""obius transformations",http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04565,2015

310,"We present a novel approach to finding critical points in cell-wise barycentrically or bilinearly interpolated vector fields on surfaces. The Poincar\e index of the critical points is determined by investigating the qualitative behavior of 0-level sets of the interpolants of the vector field components in parameter space using precomputed combinatorial results, thus avoiding the computation of the Jacobian of the vector field at the critical points in order to determine its index. The locations of the critical points within a cell are determined analytically to achieve accurate results. This approach leads to a correct treatment of cases with two first-order critical points or one second-order critical point of bilinearly interpolated vector fields within one cell, which would be missed by examining the linearized field only. We show that for the considered interpolation schemes determining the index of a critical point can be seen as a coloring problem of cell edges. A complete classification of all possible colorings in terms of the types and number of critical points yielded by each coloring is given using computational group theory. We present an efficient algorithm that makes use of these precomputed classifications in order to find and classify critical points in a cell-by-cell fashion. Issues of numerical stability, construction of the topological skeleton, topological simplification, and the statistics of the different types of critical points are also discussed.","Effenberger, Felix;Weiskopf, Daniel",ArXiv e-prints,"[X05c1933db, X05cb7488e, X06183d8fc, X099269aa3, X10ad2f3d4, X3154e0ca4, X4013ad601, X4718643bf, X47460838f, X4d933ac85, X5020057a9, X52dd8e00b, X6648674c2, X6d3093e66, X7e7369487, X83260fa69, X8b1a7e81d, X8c182b714, X91e12c165, X95bf52d33, Xa13c75227, Xa4c94c13b, Xab0c3e757, Xaefd84e2c, Xb014c16ff, Xb420a85da, Xb6e9d0491, Xb765517b9, Xb839ebf0c, Xcb4b8aa36, Xcb90c4df9, Xed407f58e, Xee0bfd0e2, Xf15293b93, Xf5ea28ee0]",X05c1933db;X05cb7488e;X06183d8fc;X099269aa3;X10ad2f3d4;X3154e0ca4;X4013ad601;X4718643bf;X47460838f;X4d933ac85;X5020057a9;X52dd8e00b;X6648674c2;X6d3093e66;X7e7369487;X83260fa69;X8b1a7e81d;X8c182b714;X91e12c165;X95bf52d33;Xa13c75227;Xa4c94c13b;Xab0c3e757;Xaefd84e2c;Xb014c16ff;Xb420a85da;Xb6e9d0491;Xb765517b9;Xb839ebf0c;Xcb4b8aa36;Xcb90c4df9;Xed407f58e;Xee0bfd0e2;Xf15293b93;Xf5ea28ee0,35,Finding and Classifying Critical Points of 2D Vector Fields: A Cell-Oriented Approach Using Group Theory,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4485,2010

When raw data can be read but lack suitable annotations as to provenance, the ability to interpret them is more straightforward if they can be assessed through simple visual techniques. In this regard digital images are a special case since their data have a natural representation on two-dimensional media surfaces.

315,"We have developed (1) a graph visualization system that allows users to explore graphs by viewing them as a succession of spanning trees selected interactively, (2) a radial graph layout algorithm, and (3) an animation algorithm that generates meaningful visualizations and smooth transitions between graphs while minimizing edge crossings during transitions and in static layouts. Our system is similar to the radial layout system of Yee et al. (2001), but differs primarily in that each node is positioned on a coordinate system centered on its own parent rather than on a single coordinate system for all nodes. Our system is thus easy to define recursively and lends itself to parallelization. It also guarantees that layouts have many nice properties, such as: it guarantees certain edges never cross during an animation. We compared the layouts and transitions produced by our algorithms to those produced by Yee et al. Results from several experiments indicate that our system produces fewer edge crossings during transitions between graph drawings, and that the transitions more often involve changes in local scaling rather than structure. These findings suggest the system has promise as an interactive graph exploration tool in a variety of settings.","Pavlo, Andrew;Homan, Christopher;Schull, Jonathan",ArXiv e-prints,"[X04838468f, X19594e402, X19904e049, X2939636ed, X29f36463f, X2d401e011, X358a0f27a, X4a6fbacd9, X63ae8690b, X6d2ec4f67, X76598b74b, X8075e007f, X833fcc513, X83e88b7de, X8e9cf12ed, X9c86e4c40, Xaa2994e33, Xb415d090d, Xce4f0e1de, Xd4ccef032, Xd609749a8, Xe903615c3, Xfcdf302f0]",X04838468f;X19594e402;X19904e049;X2939636ed;X29f36463f;X2d401e011;X358a0f27a;X4a6fbacd9;X63ae8690b;X6d2ec4f67;X76598b74b;X8075e007f;X833fcc513;X83e88b7de;X8e9cf12ed;X9c86e4c40;Xaa2994e33;Xb415d090d;Xce4f0e1de;Xd4ccef032;Xd609749a8;Xe903615c3;Xfcdf302f0,23,A parent-centered radial layout algorithm for interactive graph visualization and animation,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0606007,2006

The third method applies to surfaces specified by rectangular control nets and partitions the torus RP1 X RP1 into four rectangular regions. In all cases, the new control nets are obtained by sign flipping and permutation of indices from the original control net. The proofs that these formulae are correct involve very little computations and instead exploit the geometry of the parameter space (RP2 or RP1 X RP1).

320,"The compression of geometric structures is a relatively new field of data compression. Since about 1995, several articles have dealt with the coding of meshes, using for most of them the following approach: the vertices of the mesh are coded in an order such that it contains partially the topology of the mesh. In the same time, some simple rules attempt to predict the position of the current vertex from the positions of its neighbours that have been previously coded. In this article, we describe a compression algorithm whose principle is completely different: the order of the vertices is used to compress their coordinates, and then the topology of the mesh is reconstructed from the vertices. This algorithm, particularly suited for terrain models, achieves compression factors that are slightly greater than those of the currently available algorithms, and moreover, it allows progressive and interactive transmission of the meshes.","Devillers, Olivier;Gandoin, Pierre-Maris",ArXiv e-prints,[],,0,Geometric compression for progressive transmission,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9909018,1999

To this end, we formalize a new distance measure, fractional root mean squared distance (frmsd), which incorporates the fraction of inliers into the distance function.

322,"We present an accurate Lagrangian method based on vortex particles, level-sets, and immersed boundary methods, for animating the interplay between two fluids and rigid solids. We show that a vortex method is a good choice for simulating bi-phase flow, such as liquid and gas, with a good level of realism. Vortex particles are localized at the interfaces between the two fluids and within the regions of high turbulence. We gain local precision and efficiency from the stable advection permitted by the vorticity formulation. Moreover, our numerical method straightforwardly solves the two-way coupling problem between the fluids and animated rigid solids. This new approach is validated through numerical comparisons with reference experiments from the computational fluid community.

323,"We propose a novel method for fitting planar B-spline curves to unorganized data points. In traditional methods, optimization of control points and foot points are performed in two very time-consuming steps in each iteration: 1) control points are updated by setting up and solving a linear system of equations; and 2) foot points are computed by projecting each data point onto a B-spline curve. Our method uses the L-BFGS optimization method to optimize control points and foot points simultaneously and therefore it does not need to perform either matrix computation or foot point projection in every iteration. As a result, our method is much faster than existing methods.","Zheng, Wenni;Bo, Pengbo;Liu, Yang;Wang, Wenping",ArXiv e-prints,"[X1d9232615, X1e14e056d, X34bc4e15e, X3b5fcaa6c, X403df4f76, X47078a6d3, X4eb835330, X4ff648e2a, X56ab8c3b1, X5b4de3989, X75df343b1, X77040d641, X7f741b7cf, X86579fc6b, X89b73a150, X8c509b853, X96024e21f, X9d781a1e2, X9ebb8ca2a, Xa825dadbb, Xab54949c3, Xaf0f8dde6, Xbde1ec9f1, Xc51bd591e, Xcf32d617f, Xd0fb5ea70, Xe224b2a49, Xf03cb05fb, Xf0925980f, Xfa11a5ef1, Xfa815b6e3]",X1d9232615;X1e14e056d;X34bc4e15e;X3b5fcaa6c;X403df4f76;X47078a6d3;X4eb835330;X4ff648e2a;X56ab8c3b1;X5b4de3989;X75df343b1;X77040d641;X7f741b7cf;X86579fc6b;X89b73a150;X8c509b853;X96024e21f;X9d781a1e2;X9ebb8ca2a;Xa825dadbb;Xab54949c3;Xaf0f8dde6;Xbde1ec9f1;Xc51bd591e;Xcf32d617f;Xd0fb5ea70;Xe224b2a49;Xf03cb05fb;Xf0925980f;Xfa11a5ef1;Xfa815b6e3,31,Fast B-spline Curve Fitting by L-BFGS,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0070,2011

Graphic symbol recognition is a well known challenge in the field of document image analysis and is at heart of most graphic recognition systems. Our method uses structural approach for symbol representation and statistical classifier for symbol recognition. In our system we represent symbols by their graph based signatures: a graphic symbol is vectorized and is converted to an attributed relational graph, which is used for computing a feature vector for the symbol. This signature corresponds to geometry and topology of the symbol. We learn a Bayesian network to encode joint probability distribution of symbol signatures and use it in a supervised learning scenario for graphic symbol recognition. We have evaluated our method on synthetically deformed and degraded images of pre-segmented 2D architectural and electronic symbols from GREC databases and have obtained encouraging recognition rates.","Muzzamil Luqman, Muhammad;Brouard, Thierry;Ramel, Jean-Yves",ArXiv e-prints,"[X025fcfc27, X0dd984bdf, X1842b7bd1, X22ac04135, X2ab8c191c, X2bec7a9e9, X32c2c568f, X32ffe9d4f, X411e2c150, X422b60013, X468134764, X516a8438a, X52f8e4a04, X6d9b13c40, X70468e1ad, X7c9b0c5d1, X8b1099f41, X8bb69ead5, X9b06bc778, Xa789dc11f, Xaa964e8cd, Xab6b982ab, Xb5502e10d, Xc30fd206b, Xc3ce94daa, Xcb5c7b5c7, Xcbc00e319, Xce955cd72, Xe6bfaf298, Xec9bf709c, Xefd0da897, Xfb8c79ce7]",X025fcfc27;X0dd984bdf;X1842b7bd1;X22ac04135;X2ab8c191c;X2bec7a9e9;X32c2c568f;X32ffe9d4f;X411e2c150;X422b60013;X468134764;X516a8438a;X52f8e4a04;X6d9b13c40;X70468e1ad;X7c9b0c5d1;X8b1099f41;X8bb69ead5;X9b06bc778;Xa789dc11f;Xaa964e8cd;Xab6b982ab;Xb5502e10d;Xc30fd206b;Xc3ce94daa;Xcb5c7b5c7;Xcbc00e319;Xce955cd72;Xe6bfaf298;Xec9bf709c;Xefd0da897;Xfb8c79ce7,32,Graphic Symbol Recognition using Graph Based Signature and Bayesian Network Classifier,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5424,2010

Two competing conditions for replacing the tone values - one position on the local mean value the other on the local variance - produce a peculiar pattern on the image.

332,"Space time cube representation is an information visualization technique where spatiotemporal data points are mapped into a cube. Fast and correct analysis of such information is important in for instance geospatial and social visualization applications. Information visualization researchers have previously argued that space time cube representation is beneficial in revealing complex spatiotemporal patterns in a dataset to users. The argument is based on the fact that both time and spatial information are displayed simultaneously to users, an effect difficult to achieve in other representations. However, to our knowledge the actual usefulness of space time cube representation in conveying complex spatiotemporal patterns to users has not been empirically validated. To fill this gap we report on a between-subjects experiment comparing novice users error rates and response times when answering a set of questions using either space time cube or a baseline 2D representation. For some simple questions the error rates were lower when using the baseline representation. For complex questions where the participants needed an overall understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of the dataset, the space time cube representation resulted in on average twice as fast response times with no difference in error rates compared to the baseline. These results provide an empirical foundation for the hypothesis that space time cube representation benefits users when analyzing complex spatiotemporal patterns.","Kristensson, Per Ola;Dahlback, Nils;Anundi, Daniel;Bjornstad, Marius;Gillberg, Hanna;Haraldsson, Jonas;Martensson, Ingrid;Nordvall, Matttias;Stahl, Josefin",ArXiv e-prints,"[X266a28dcc, X2ac1150f3, X43fd6406e, X8ec2c15ed, X9868f667f]",X266a28dcc;X2ac1150f3;X43fd6406e;X8ec2c15ed;X9868f667f,5,The Trade-offs with Space Time Cube Representation of Spatiotemporal Patterns,http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1618,2007

334,"Twenty-five years ago, Crow published the shadow volume approach for determining shadowed regions in a scene. A decade ago, Heidmann described a hardware-accelerated stencil buffer-based shadow volume algorithm. Unfortunately hardware-accelerated stenciled shadow volume techniques have not been widely adopted by 3D games and applications due in large part to the lack of robustness of described techniques. This situation persists despite widely available hardware support. Specifically what has been lacking is a technique that robustly handles various ""hard"" situations created by near or far plane clipping of shadow volumes. We describe a robust, artifact-free technique for hardware-accelerated rendering of stenciled shadow volumes. Assuming existing hardware, we resolve the issues otherwise caused by shadow volume near and far plane clipping through a combination of (1) placing the conventional far clip plane ""at infinity"", (2) rasterization with infinite shadow volume polygons via homogeneous coordinates, and (3) adopting a zfail stencil-testing scheme. Depth clamping, a new rasterization feature provided by NVIDIA's GeForce3, preserves existing depth precision by not requiring the far plane to be placed at infinity. We also propose two-sided stencil testing to improve the efficiency of rendering stenciled shadow volumes.","Everitt, Cass;Kilgard, Mark J.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0455e0437, X0636b2a97, X075d02846, X0cf4f8318, X1240c02ef, X14f5aa18c, X152f74c0b, X19e9ee593, X1b55832be, X1fd672f18, X266fab556, X26760c481, X27db16192, X286883da9, X28727f5ec, X29ae9f79b, X2bd1ad7ab, X2e1a09d4f, X35abeb9d3, X35ea9b9d8, X3c69d1fca, X3ebb13f2a, X417326222, X46ddf08fb, X4903ee9ea, X4b2291426, X4dd6303ab, X4f67bf284, X594c0247e, X59a8e3a5e, X5a2d332c9, X5f7f55ba1, X5fa815889, X5fb9e0408, X611bf909b, X643b4699b, X66677f672, X6ae35e961, X6b52d7faa, X6c96b4673, X7076f1eb7, X7219ec0a4, X733111b89, X79e684fd3, X7acd8fd4d, X839f28694, X84af21e06, X8a22c8fa4, X8c27413ec, X8debe1585, X8f83a0f0f, X92c37c951, X95e842500, X99693601d, Xa36e52d46, Xa4f551a47, Xa6aedcf04, Xa6e15e22f, Xae9a53144, Xb06ddfdfd, Xb2b1a3c88, Xb96e113a7, Xbd1bd4aa9, Xc041b9f71, Xc04f70fec, Xc1fd439c8, Xc763b0073, Xc7c15b7e2, Xc9e1da3b2, Xca2a495ca, Xd149bd43b, Xd1914ac86, Xd68b78d8e, Xd6cac32e1, Xd9057909b, Xdcff94abc, Xe7882bcea, Xead3d36b7, Xeb7ed16cb, Xee477f182, Xeea58af4d, Xf389f9f92, Xf5e530e95, Xf7532e397, Xf8e4051e0, Xfabb41518, Xfe9d67eb7]",X0455e0437;X0636b2a97;X075d02846;X0cf4f8318;X1240c02ef;X14f5aa18c;X152f74c0b;X19e9ee593;X1b55832be;X1fd672f18;X266fab556;X26760c481;X27db16192;X286883da9;X28727f5ec;X29ae9f79b;X2bd1ad7ab;X2e1a09d4f;X35abeb9d3;X35ea9b9d8;X3c69d1fca;X3ebb13f2a;X417326222;X46ddf08fb;X4903ee9ea;X4b2291426;X4dd6303ab;X4f67bf284;X594c0247e;X59a8e3a5e;X5a2d332c9;X5f7f55ba1;X5fa815889;X5fb9e0408;X611bf909b;X643b4699b;X66677f672;X6ae35e961;X6b52d7faa;X6c96b4673;X7076f1eb7;X7219ec0a4;X733111b89;X79e684fd3;X7acd8fd4d;X839f28694;X84af21e06;X8a22c8fa4;X8c27413ec;X8debe1585;X8f83a0f0f;X92c37c951;X95e842500;X99693601d;Xa36e52d46;Xa4f551a47;Xa6aedcf04;Xa6e15e22f;Xae9a53144;Xb06ddfdfd;Xb2b1a3c88;Xb96e113a7;Xbd1bd4aa9;Xc041b9f71;Xc04f70fec;Xc1fd439c8;Xc763b0073;Xc7c15b7e2;Xc9e1da3b2;Xca2a495ca;Xd149bd43b;Xd1914ac86;Xd68b78d8e;Xd6cac32e1;Xd9057909b;Xdcff94abc;Xe7882bcea;Xead3d36b7;Xeb7ed16cb;Xee477f182;Xeea58af4d;Xf389f9f92;Xf5e530e95;Xf7532e397;Xf8e4051e0;Xfabb41518;Xfe9d67eb7,87,Practical and Robust Stenciled Shadow Volumes for Hardware-Accelerated Rendering,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0301002,2003
335,"Character posing is of interest in computer animation. It is difficult due to its dependence on inverse kinematics (IK) techniques and articulate property of human characters . To solve the IK problem, classical methods that rely on numerical solutions often suffer from the under-determination problem and can not guarantee naturalness. Existing data-driven methods address this problem by learning from motion capture data. When facing a large variety of poses however, these methods may not be able to capture the pose styles or be applicable in real-time environment. Inspired from the low-rank motion de-noising and completion model in \cite{lai2011motion}, we propose a novel model for character posing based on sparse coding. Unlike conventional approaches, our model directly captures the pose styles in Euclidean space to provide intuitive training error measurements and facilitate pose synthesis. A pose dictionary is learned in training stage and based on it natural poses are synthesized to satisfy users' constraints . We compare our model with existing models for tasks of pose de-noising and completion. Experiments show our model obtains lower de-noising and completion error. We also provide User Interface(UI) examples illustrating that our model is effective for interactive character posing.","Lai, Ranch Y. Q.;Yuen, Pong C.;Lee, K. W.;Lai, J.

336,"We propose a hybrid image-space/object-space solution to the classical hidden surface removal problem: Given n disjoint triangles in Real^3 and p sample points (``pixels'') in the xy-plane, determine the first triangle directly behind each pixel. Our algorithm constructs the sampled visibility map of the triangles with respect to the pixels, which is the subset of the trapezoids in a trapezoidal decomposition of the analytic visibility map that contain at least one pixel. The sampled visibility map adapts to local changes in image complexity, and its complexity is bounded both by the number of pixels and by the complexity of the analytic visibility map. Our algorithm runs in time O(n^{1+e} + n^{2/3+e}t^{2/3} + p), where t is the output size and e is any positive constant. This is nearly optimal in the worst case and compares favorably with the best output-sensitive algorithms for both ray casting and analytic hidden surface removal. In the special case where the pixels form a regular grid, a sweepline variant of our algorithm runs in time O(n^{1+e} + n^{2/3+e}t^{2/3} + t log p), which is usually sublinear in the number of pixels.","Erickson, Jeff",ArXiv e-prints,"[X04ed9d85b, X22fab5ac4]",X04ed9d85b;X22fab5ac4,2,Finite-resolution hidden surface removal,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9910017,1999

This method can be used to create all types of photorealistic human hair (head hair, facial hair and body hair). It is also suitable for fur and grass generation. Applications of this method include: hairstyle designing/editing, damaged hair image restoration, human hair animation, virtual makeover of a human, and landscape creation.","Lin, Alice J.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0485af992, X05377ee9c, X0c5d069c6, X1cc21151e, X2490e9cff, X3d4261199, X3fa26470f, X4bea66ed3, X52f5bd69f, X5af51e03c, X6a262292c, X87c0525d4, X94e0026ef, Xa09cdf47f, Xadf322a18, Xc18ac4909, Xc38fa1241, Xce3a50502, Xe998a58d5]",X0485af992;X05377ee9c;X0c5d069c6;X1cc21151e;X2490e9cff;X3d4261199;X3fa26470f;X4bea66ed3;X52f5bd69f;X5af51e03c;X6a262292c;X87c0525d4;X94e0026ef;Xa09cdf47f;Xadf322a18;Xc18ac4909;Xc38fa1241;Xce3a50502;Xe998a58d5,19,Computer-Generated Photorealistic Hair,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0206029,2002
338,"I postulate that human or other intelligent agents function or should function as follows. They store all sensory observations as they come - the data is holy. At any time, given some agent's current coding capabilities, part of the data is compressible by a short and hopefully fast program / description / explanation / world model. In the agent's subjective eyes, such data is more regular and more ""beautiful"" than other data. It is well-known that knowledge of regularity and repeatability may improve the agent's ability to plan actions leading to external rewards. In absence of such rewards, however, known beauty is boring. Then ""interestingness"" becomes the first derivative of subjective beauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly apparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful. Such progress in compressibility is measured and maximized by the curiosity drive: create action sequences that extend the observation history and yield previously unknown / unpredictable but quickly learnable algorithmic regularity. We discuss how all of the above can be naturally implemented on computers, through an extension of passive unsupervised learning to the case of active data selection: we reward a general reinforcement learner (with access to the adaptive compressor) for actions that improve the subjective compressibility of the growing data. An unusually large breakthrough in compressibility deserves the name ""discovery"". The ""creativity"" of artists, dancers, musicians, pure mathematicians can be viewed as a by-product of this principle. Several qualitative examples support this hypothesis.","Schmidhuber, Juergen",ArXiv e-prints,"[X02b25df7b, X048299ba0, X05e4bff36, X09e9845bb, X0ad0c1e78, X0d40678cf, X0e55e602f, X0f4405617, X1b5101936, X1d3a73226, X1e33faf1f, X1e79150a2, X1f32bafcc, X21c99cc7f, X22266b6ba, X238f88309, X24c261853, X2603c75ff, X260a59d54, X291825025, X29648e8c5, X2b2354889, X2e7ab86f7, X2ea286779, X31e4fcc96, X358490012, X370afe1df, X39bb67679, X474c100c6, X48c64b58f, X4a5247ad0, X4baa5ad77, X4c2b1a09b, X4c9a3488d, X4df9f6972, X4fb0839d2, X50abd122c, X514bd7d6b, X568b460d0, X5970550e5, X5e9372954, X5f8728e60, X5fc44da43, X618da8da5, X63475cc5e, X6e0b2d2c4, X71fed45e9, X730024c5a, X753a104ea, X77877b884, X785946d53, X7e268f953, X7e33fbf7c, X80469eb3b, X85ab43db1, X8a950a949, X8ecb588bf, X9125b6fb9, X91c612155, X928a7a42f, X92d0e32eb, X951bc046e, X9557a544f, X9587b1eae, X9587e51f9, X9718dd0c0, X9e857a2a3, Xacf20c5d8, Xadbe84529, Xb3e242c6a, Xb56be6221, Xb751a0c22, Xb87d7cfa0, Xbb7c5d8f2, Xbf1af8604, Xc02e77266, Xc0b3a42a9, Xc1630867e, Xc54a9139a, Xc6cc7dfe4, Xce8c8b2a0, Xd0f1554cf, Xd54acce0b, Xd70401b74, Xdb1b9ac21, Xdbe3878f5, Xdf0c008f9, Xe37307de1, Xe618306f7, Xe838dd890, Xea120ce97, Xea2f1b991, Xea997f8a3, Xecf5eeaf4, Xed19f154a, Xed564d49a, Xf0cc60048, Xf72c18013, Xfa7a7aa28, Xff4f16b69]",X02b25df7b;X048299ba0;X05e4bff36;X09e9845bb;X0ad0c1e78;X0d40678cf;X0e55e602f;X0f4405617;X1b5101936;X1d3a73226;X1e33faf1f;X1e79150a2;X1f32bafcc;X21c99cc7f;X22266b6ba;X238f88309;X24c261853;X2603c75ff;X260a59d54;X291825025;X29648e8c5;X2b2354889;X2e7ab86f7;X2ea286779;X31e4fcc96;X358490012;X370afe1df;X39bb67679;X474c100c6;X48c64b58f;X4a5247ad0;X4baa5ad77;X4c2b1a09b;X4c9a3488d;X4df9f6972;X4fb0839d2;X50abd122c;X514bd7d6b;X568b460d0;X5970550e5;X5e9372954;X5f8728e60;X5fc44da43;X618da8da5;X63475cc5e;X6e0b2d2c4;X71fed45e9;X730024c5a;X753a104ea;X77877b884;X785946d53;X7e268f953;X7e33fbf7c;X80469eb3b;X85ab43db1;X8a950a949;X8ecb588bf;X9125b6fb9;X91c612155;X928a7a42f;X92d0e32eb;X951bc046e;X9557a544f;X9587b1eae;X9587e51f9;X9718dd0c0;X9e857a2a3;Xacf20c5d8;Xadbe84529;Xb3e242c6a;Xb56be6221;Xb751a0c22;Xb87d7cfa0;Xbb7c5d8f2;Xbf1af8604;Xc02e77266;Xc0b3a42a9;Xc1630867e;Xc54a9139a;Xc6cc7dfe4;Xce8c8b2a0;Xd0f1554cf;Xd54acce0b;Xd70401b74;Xdb1b9ac21;Xdbe3878f5;Xdf0c008f9;Xe37307de1;Xe618306f7;Xe838dd890;Xea120ce97;Xea2f1b991;Xea997f8a3;Xecf5eeaf4;Xed19f154a;Xed564d49a;Xf0cc60048;Xf72c18013;Xfa7a7aa28;Xff4f16b69,100,"Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity & Creativity",http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0674,2007

340,"We are communicating with computers on two different levels. On upper level we have a very flexible system of windows: we can move them, resize, overlap or put side by side. At any moment we decide what would be the best view and reorganize the whole view easily. Then we start any application, go to the inner level, and everything changes. Here we are stripped of all the flexibility and can work only inside the scenario, developed by the designer of the program. Interface will allow us to change some tiny details, but in general everything is fixed: graphics is neither moveable, nor resizable, and the same with controls. Author designed an extremely powerful mechanism of turning graphical objects and controls into moveable and resizable. This can not only significantly improve the existing applications, but this will bring the applications to another level. (To estimate the possible difference, try to imagine the Windows system without its flexibility and compare it with the current one.)

342,"We adapt multilevel, force-directed graph layout techniques to visualizing dynamic graphs in which vertices and edges are added and removed in an online fashion (i.e., unpredictably). We maintain multiple levels of coarseness using a dynamic, randomized coarsening algorithm. To ensure the vertices follow smooth trajectories, we employ dynamics simulation techniques, treating the vertices as point particles. We simulate fine and coarse levels of the graph simultaneously, coupling the dynamics of adjacent levels. Projection from coarser to finer levels is adaptive, with the projection determined by an affine transformation that evolves alongside the graph layouts. The result is a dynamic graph visualizer that quickly and smoothly adapts to changes in a graph.","Veldhuizen, Todd L.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0983f3bed, X098a69c19, X0aaf7783f, X0d951b771, X0dbe01fbe, X0e655bef4, X155914139, X15666ad39, X15c7d30b4, X184fc8990, X1f5f321a9, X2106b2cd8, X218cdf0f9, X263b06f56, X298764501, X2a72fbebb, X2b24d6817, X2eab31c7e, X3a7d0c8d8, X3b134e96a, X42bf71413, X42fe41c43, X4849a60db, X49a5a6d03, X4cdf4ed5b, X4ef9361d9, X4f9627333, X53a0030b0, X541718bd3, X570e4b1d9, X5ff842eef, X60e44b916, X630fcc952, X68c76e5e8, X692326f38, X6b50d0f82, X6b55c93bb, X6bb2c6b48, X6ca0a9cbd, X6f8e90eed, X6fbfa6873, X72e07afdd, X74ad4ddf5, X754b1524a, X7ade03eaf, X7c9bcaff1, X7cf96383e, X8086a0142, X860f62439, X8a51ecc6e, X97141c24e, X97b6121f0, X9c954e382, X9d898ab4e, X9d984cd92, X9df6cbbd9, Xa0d2f1970, Xa2dea31e3, Xa3e6ecf94, Xa5f0bdb78, Xa782cf5d9, Xa7affdbb0, Xaa45d30b2, Xb4aa3beca, Xb685b7fd2, Xb8b5b5922, Xb8d9c88b0, Xb9496f1d4, Xbe78ce079, Xbed3b8cf2, Xc3200d073, Xc5f15e415, Xc89cc2cd1, Xc96a09b10, Xcb5e34be8, Xcc4c6a212, Xcd3e6d6bf, Xce4a5bf42, Xceeaf796b, Xd45745cc7, Xd7c81ae36, Xde19257e9, Xe01bbb323, Xe324c7372, Xe34b01aad, Xe5780e61e, Xe5cda0e03, Xe64d18dab, Xe88f2f520, Xf28677305, Xf2bf5ecae, Xf2f406366, Xf84b839d5, Xf89597f06]",X0983f3bed;X098a69c19;X0aaf7783f;X0d951b771;X0dbe01fbe;X0e655bef4;X155914139;X15666ad39;X15c7d30b4;X184fc8990;X1f5f321a9;X2106b2cd8;X218cdf0f9;X263b06f56;X298764501;X2a72fbebb;X2b24d6817;X2eab31c7e;X3a7d0c8d8;X3b134e96a;X42bf71413;X42fe41c43;X4849a60db;X49a5a6d03;X4cdf4ed5b;X4ef9361d9;X4f9627333;X53a0030b0;X541718bd3;X570e4b1d9;X5ff842eef;X60e44b916;X630fcc952;X68c76e5e8;X692326f38;X6b50d0f82;X6b55c93bb;X6bb2c6b48;X6ca0a9cbd;X6f8e90eed;X6fbfa6873;X72e07afdd;X74ad4ddf5;X754b1524a;X7ade03eaf;X7c9bcaff1;X7cf96383e;X8086a0142;X860f62439;X8a51ecc6e;X97141c24e;X97b6121f0;X9c954e382;X9d898ab4e;X9d984cd92;X9df6cbbd9;Xa0d2f1970;Xa2dea31e3;Xa3e6ecf94;Xa5f0bdb78;Xa782cf5d9;Xa7affdbb0;Xaa45d30b2;Xb4aa3beca;Xb685b7fd2;Xb8b5b5922;Xb8d9c88b0;Xb9496f1d4;Xbe78ce079;Xbed3b8cf2;Xc3200d073;Xc5f15e415;Xc89cc2cd1;Xc96a09b10;Xcb5e34be8;Xcc4c6a212;Xcd3e6d6bf;Xce4a5bf42;Xceeaf796b;Xd45745cc7;Xd7c81ae36;Xde19257e9;Xe01bbb323;Xe324c7372;Xe34b01aad;Xe5780e61e;Xe5cda0e03;Xe64d18dab;Xe88f2f520;Xf28677305;Xf2bf5ecae;Xf2f406366;Xf84b839d5;Xf89597f06,94,Dynamic Multilevel Graph Visualization,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1549,2007

347,Convergence properties of binary stationary subdivision schemes for curves have been analyzed using the techniques of z-transforms and eigenanalysis. Eigenanalysis provides a way to determine derivative continuity at specific points based on the eigenvalues of a finite matrix. None of the well-known subdivision schemes for curves have complex eigenvalues. We prove when a convergent scheme with palindromic mask can have complex eigenvalues and that a lower limit for the size of the mask exists in this case. We find a scheme with complex eigenvalues achieving this lower bound. Furthermore we investigate this scheme numerically and explain from a geometric viewpoint why such a scheme has not yet been used in computer-aided geometric design.,"Kuehn, Christian",ArXiv e-prints,"[5527c28cfa, Xa3b1cbc71]",5527c28cfa;Xa3b1cbc71,2,Complex Eigenvalues for Binary Subdivision Schemes,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3249,2008

The main difference is that the conformal ratios that appear are no longer real in general.

349,"Motivation of our work is to present a new methodology for symbol recognition. We support structural methods for representing visual associations in graphic documents. The proposed method employs a structural approach for symbol representation and a statistical classifier for recognition. We vectorize a graphic symbol, encode its topological and geometrical information by an ARG and compute a signature from this structural graph. To address the sensitivity of structural representations to deformations and degradations, we use data adapted fuzzy intervals while computing structural signature. The joint probability distribution of signatures is encoded by a Bayesian network. This network in fact serves as a mechanism for pruning irrelevant features and choosing a subset of interesting features from structural signatures, for underlying symbol set. Finally we deploy the Bayesian network in supervised learning scenario for recognizing query symbols. We have evaluated the robustness of our method against noise, on synthetically deformed and degraded images of pre-segmented 2D architectural and electronic symbols from GREC databases and have obtained encouraging recognition rates. A second set of experimentation was carried out for evaluating the performance of our method against context noise i.e. symbols cropped from complete documents. The results support the use of our signature by a symbol spotting system.","Muzzamil Luqman, Muhammad;Delalandre, Mathieu;Brouard, Thierry;Ramel, Jean-Yves;Lladós, Josep",ArXiv e-prints,"[X422656487, X446481ec2, X484a4ad2c, X59044c5f4, X73f18f4b6, Xb104bf50f, Xb5502e10d, Xbb31489f7, Xc5a85dbd5, Xec9bf709c, Xf302aab9f]",X422656487;X446481ec2;X484a4ad2c;X59044c5f4;X73f18f4b6;Xb104bf50f;Xb5502e10d;Xbb31489f7;Xc5a85dbd5;Xec9bf709c;Xf302aab9f,11,Employing fuzzy intervals and loop-based methodology for designing structural signature: an application to symbol recognition,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5427,2010

Both static and dynamic image partitioning techniques which replicate the octree of the complete scene in all the processors and have load-balancing, have been developed for one frame rendering.

352,"A new computer haptics algorithm to be used in general interactive manipulations of deformable virtual objects is presented. In multimodal interactive simulations, haptic feedback computation often comes from contact forces. Subsequently, the fidelity of haptic rendering depends significantly on contact space modeling. Contact and friction laws between deformable models are often simplified in up to date methods. They do not allow a ""realistic"" rendering of the subtleties of contact space physical phenomena (such as slip and stick effects due to friction or mechanical coupling between contacts). In this paper, we use Signorini's contact law and Coulomb's friction law as a computer haptics basis. Real-time performance is made possible thanks to a linearization of the behavior in the contact space, formulated as the so-called Delassus operator, and iteratively solved by a Gauss-Seidel type algorithm. Dynamic deformation uses corotational global formulation to obtain the Delassus operator in which the mass and stiffness ratio are dissociated from the simulation time step. This last point is crucial to keep stable haptic feedback. This global approach has been packaged, implemented, and tested. Stable and realistic 6D haptic feedback is demonstrated through a clipping task experiment.","Duriez, Christian;Dubois, Frédéric;Kheddar, Abderrahmane;Andriot, Claude",ArXiv e-prints,"[X05d4c5908, X07dca9b2f, X13632cf11, X24651ec6e, X249f7683e, X2e221abf6, X3923a5673, X43a3193f0, X43d6e0c1f, X4b9c5a342, X631df69a6, X65fa53b6b, X6c76a11d0, X6f38496a0, X746ef5e9c, X788ae16a0, X80e52c196, X84a9e2a70, X91a0b9f63, X99e3aaae6, X9f7320241, Xab18e32ed, Xb0eeec10c, Xb13528bdf, Xb30c61bcc, Xba6b39ce3, Xbb336d5e6, Xd743e1fa1, Xdbff7e8d9, Xdf7afad02, Xea0a25ee4, Xeb4675ada, Xeef642663, Xf602690b9]",X05d4c5908;X07dca9b2f;X13632cf11;X24651ec6e;X249f7683e;X2e221abf6;X3923a5673;X43a3193f0;X43d6e0c1f;X4b9c5a342;X631df69a6;X65fa53b6b;X6c76a11d0;X6f38496a0;X746ef5e9c;X788ae16a0;X80e52c196;X84a9e2a70;X91a0b9f63;X99e3aaae6;X9f7320241;Xab18e32ed;Xb0eeec10c;Xb13528bdf;Xb30c61bcc;Xba6b39ce3;Xbb336d5e6;Xd743e1fa1;Xdbff7e8d9;Xdf7afad02;Xea0a25ee4;Xeb4675ada;Xeef642663;Xf602690b9,34,Realistic Haptic Rendering of Interacting Deformable Objects in Virtual Environments,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0561,2008

We model the morphs as linear interpolations in a suitable shape space $\mathcal{S}$. For triangulated 3D polygons, we prove that interpolating linearly in this shape space corresponds to the most isometric morph in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We then extend this shape space to arbitrary triangulations in 3D using a heuristic approach and show the practical use of the approach using experiments. Furthermore, we discuss a modified shape space that is useful for isometric skeleton morphing.

354,"For medical volume visualization, one of the most important tasks is to reveal clinically relevant details from the 3D scan (CT, MRI ...), e.g. the coronary arteries, without obscuring them with less significant parts. These volume datasets contain different materials which are difficult to extract and visualize with 1D transfer functions based solely on the attenuation coefficient. Multi-dimensional transfer functions allow a much more precise classification of data which makes it easier to separate different surfaces from each other. Unfortunately, setting up multi-dimensional transfer functions can become a fairly complex task, generally accomplished by trial and error. This paper explains neural networks, and then presents an efficient way to speed up visualization process by semi-automatic transfer function generation.

359,"The concept of metaphor, in particular graphical (or visual) metaphor, is central to the field of information visualization. Information graphics and interactive information visualization systems employ a variety of metaphorical devices to make abstract, complex, voluminous, or otherwise difficult-to-comprehend information understandable in graphical terms. This paper explores the use of metaphor in information visualization, advancing the theory previously argued by Johnson, Lakoff, Tversky et al. that many information graphics are metaphorically understood in terms of cognitively entrenched spatial patterns known as image schemas. These patterns serve to structure and constrain abstract reasoning processes via metaphorical projection operations that are grounded in everyday perceptual experiences with phenomena such as containment, movement, and force dynamics. Building on previous research, I argue that information graphics promote comprehension of their target information through the use of graphical patterns that invoke these preexisting schematic structures. I further theorize that the degree of structural alignment of a particular graphic with one or more corresponding image schemas accounts for its perceived degree of intuitiveness. Accordingly, image schema theory can provide a powerful explanatory and predictive framework for visualization research. I review relevant theories of analogy and metaphor, and discuss the image schematic properties of several common types of information graphic. I conclude with the proposal that the inventory of image schemas culled from linguistic studies can serve as the basis for an inventory of design elements suitable for developing intuitive and effective new information visualization techniques.","Risch, John S.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X00e1301ea, X020408df3, X0529b79f8, X05c3d4d78, X05c6829d7, X0ca86bf7d, X0e81e4fa1, X12e9ba93a, X1407c6ebf, X1cddd07c9, X1ea829f6d, X1ffa9368d, X213bc1b28, X28fcb0a9b, X2907bbc67, X2c4208c1a, X2caf45a3d, X3117e3e02, X31ec0e60c, X345ab1d56, X34725d2c2, X356a8d20d, X413e63bdb, X4534dc391, X4b2125d45, X4ce61d251, X542e0dc2f, X55fb21a14, X5692e9fbe, X5d12e7f21, X63cf0a692, X67d6e77f4, X685d89d06, X699a89aa7, X6a4b39108, X6e48158be, X708dc3401, X70ec5dc30, X7e015ee7d, X801ebaa36, X81c40a365, X82829b4b9, X82d26ae85, X83148e584, X85d09828e, X90d3d7f43, X95b275909, X95f993796, X977aef4d5, X9e33b8529, Xa7bdb4a7b, Xa854dbf9c, Xaa0706282, Xb27237477, Xb2ecfee3c, Xbd04aa85d, Xc179cb439, Xc3cfc07b7, Xc8fcb0dd2, Xc91e96ce3, Xcaa5c3ad8, Xd50d70e69, Xd8cb9aad5, Xe50dede91, Xe79809d73, Xec08f0d1f, Xed8c3fe0e, Xf0beaba6c, Xf30281725, Xf30ac8983, Xf7f66a006, Xf7fcb1af6, Xfd4ba29dd]",X00e1301ea;X020408df3;X0529b79f8;X05c3d4d78;X05c6829d7;X0ca86bf7d;X0e81e4fa1;X12e9ba93a;X1407c6ebf;X1cddd07c9;X1ea829f6d;X1ffa9368d;X213bc1b28;X28fcb0a9b;X2907bbc67;X2c4208c1a;X2caf45a3d;X3117e3e02;X31ec0e60c;X345ab1d56;X34725d2c2;X356a8d20d;X413e63bdb;X4534dc391;X4b2125d45;X4ce61d251;X542e0dc2f;X55fb21a14;X5692e9fbe;X5d12e7f21;X63cf0a692;X67d6e77f4;X685d89d06;X699a89aa7;X6a4b39108;X6e48158be;X708dc3401;X70ec5dc30;X7e015ee7d;X801ebaa36;X81c40a365;X82829b4b9;X82d26ae85;X83148e584;X85d09828e;X90d3d7f43;X95b275909;X95f993796;X977aef4d5;X9e33b8529;Xa7bdb4a7b;Xa854dbf9c;Xaa0706282;Xb27237477;Xb2ecfee3c;Xbd04aa85d;Xc179cb439;Xc3cfc07b7;Xc8fcb0dd2;Xc91e96ce3;Xcaa5c3ad8;Xd50d70e69;Xd8cb9aad5;Xe50dede91;Xe79809d73;Xec08f0d1f;Xed8c3fe0e;Xf0beaba6c;Xf30281725;Xf30ac8983;Xf7f66a006;Xf7fcb1af6;Xfd4ba29dd,73,On the role of metaphor in information visualization,http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0884,2008

Our tools allow to automatically retexture existing geometry in order to apply unique texturing on each face. Furthermore we investigate several techniques that try to minimize visual artifacts in the case that only a small amount of pages can be streamed per frame. We analyze the influence of different heuristics that are responsible for the page selection.

363,"Applications that require Internet access to remote 3D datasets are often limited by the storage costs of 3D models. Several compression methods are available to address these limits for objects represented by triangle meshes. Many CAD and VRML models, however, are represented as quadrilateral meshes or mixed triangle/quadrilateral meshes, and these models may also require compression. We present an algorithm for encoding the connectivity of such quadrilateral meshes, and we demonstrate that by preserving and exploiting the original quad structure, our approach achieves encodings 30 - 80% smaller than an approach based on randomly splitting quads into triangles. We present both a code with a proven worst-case cost of 3 bits per vertex (or 2.75 bits per vertex for meshes without valence-two vertices) and entropy-coding results for typical meshes ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 bits per vertex, depending on the regularity of the mesh. Our method may be implemented by a rule for a particular splitting of quads into triangles and by using the compression and decompression algorithms introduced in [Rossignac99] and [Rossignac&Szymczak99]. We also present extensions to the algorithm to compress meshes with holes and handles and meshes containing triangles and other polygons as well as quads.","King, Davis;Rossignac, Jarek;Szymczak, Andrzej",ArXiv e-prints,"[X191de61f4, X256d4f24b, X2ba29801e, X3a350aa32, X3ccfa890d, X61d2f21d1, Xcce62d11f, Xd1b8abf6e]",X191de61f4;X256d4f24b;X2ba29801e;X3a350aa32;X3ccfa890d;X61d2f21d1;Xcce62d11f;Xd1b8abf6e,8,Connectivity Compression for Irregular Quadrilateral Meshes,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0005005,2000

The pixels on the circle are plotted independent of one another and the operations involved in finding the locus of the circle from the intersection of straight lines are parallelizable. Integer only arithmetic and algorithmic optimizations are used for speedup. The proposed algorithm makes use of an envelope to form a parabolic arc which is consequent transformed into a circle. The use of parabolic arcs for the transformation results in higher pixel errors as the radius of the circle to be drawn increases.

370,"We prove Gibbs distribution of two-state spin systems(also known as binary Markov random fields) without hard constrains on a tree exhibits strong spatial mixing(also known as strong correlation decay), under the assumption that, for arbitrary `external field', the absolute value of `inverse temperature' is small, or the `external field' is uniformly large or small. The first condition on `inverse temperature' is tight if the distribution is restricted to ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic Ising models. Thanks to Weitz's self-avoiding tree, we extends the result for sparse on average graphs, which generalizes part of the recent work of Mossel and Sly\cite{MS08}, who proved the strong spatial mixing property for ferromagnetic Ising model. Our proof yields a different approach, carefully exploiting the monotonicity of local recursion. To our best knowledge, the second condition of `external field' for strong spatial mixing in this paper is first considered and stated in term of `maximum average degree' and `interaction energy'. As an application, we present an FPTAS for partition functions of two-state spin models without hard constrains under the above assumptions in a general family of graphs including interesting bounded degree graphs.","Zhang, Jinshan",ArXiv e-prints,"[X2cbed41dd, X6314034f5, X703246a28, Xc815561e1, Xdcc47f161]",X2cbed41dd;X6314034f5;X703246a28;Xc815561e1;Xdcc47f161,5,Strong Spatial Mixing and Approximating Partition Functions of Two-State Spin Systems without Hard Constrains,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0754,2008
371,"We provide linear-time algorithms for geometric graphs with sublinearly many crossings. That is, we provide algorithms running in O(n) time on connected geometric graphs having n vertices and k crossings, where k is smaller than n by an iterated logarithmic factor. Specific problems we study include Voronoi diagrams and single-source shortest paths. Our algorithms all run in linear time in the standard comparison-based computational model; hence, we make no assumptions about the distribution or bit complexities of edge weights, nor do we utilize unusual bit-level operations on memory words. Instead, our algorithms are based on a planarization method that ""zeroes in"" on edge crossings, together with methods for extending planar separator decompositions to geometric graphs with sublinearly many crossings. Incidentally, our planarization algorithm also solves an open computational geometry problem of Chazelle for triangulating a self-intersecting polygonal chain having n segments and k crossings in linear time, for the case when k is sublinear in n by an iterated logarithmic factor.","Eppstein, David;Goodrich, Michael T.;Strash, Darren",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0f8f4bd06, X1f15998e2, X1f577feac, X26901823e, X2c42e738c, X33e857d82, X3612794f1, X399e073c9, X3d2bf5dfc, X4b4ff5e7c, X4b7ca7cf7, X4fcbc4db7, X515b15963, X5161c1bd0, X556f0fb5e, X5853861a6, X58ec03035, X69dd8ef31, X6ca61ed55, X74f55fcf1, X758ba0e16, X76321dc86, X7755a8120, X77fa6ddd0, X785816b7e, X78e71a25b, X7ead8c8db, X800b7ef9f, X82684d2d2, Xa77adbe3c, Xa8416ac92, Xada075d24, Xaff39e94f, Xba16d64f2, Xc1d11cc37, Xc7684a91e, Xc89c84380, Xd796f932b, Xd990f198a, Xe7a4a38de, Xeb4675ada, Xebf877705, Xee263d269, Xeefefa919, Xf6c05f638]",X0f8f4bd06;X1f15998e2;X1f577feac;X26901823e;X2c42e738c;X33e857d82;X3612794f1;X399e073c9;X3d2bf5dfc;X4b4ff5e7c;X4b7ca7cf7;X4fcbc4db7;X515b15963;X5161c1bd0;X556f0fb5e;X5853861a6;X58ec03035;X69dd8ef31;X6ca61ed55;X74f55fcf1;X758ba0e16;X76321dc86;X7755a8120;X77fa6ddd0;X785816b7e;X78e71a25b;X7ead8c8db;X800b7ef9f;X82684d2d2;Xa77adbe3c;Xa8416ac92;Xada075d24;Xaff39e94f;Xba16d64f2;Xc1d11cc37;Xc7684a91e;Xc89c84380;Xd796f932b;Xd990f198a;Xe7a4a38de;Xeb4675ada;Xebf877705;Xee263d269;Xeefefa919;Xf6c05f638,45,Linear-Time Algorithms for Geometric Graphs with Sublinearly Many Edge Crossings,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0893,2008
372,"In this work, we present a new method for generating a threshold structure. This kind of structure can be advantageously used in various halftoning algorithms such as clustered-dot or dispersed-dot dithering, error diffusion with threshold modulation, etc. The proposed method is based on rectifiable polyominoes -- a non-periodic hierarchical structure, which tiles the Euclidean plane with no gaps. Each polyomino contains a fixed number of discrete threshold values. Thanks to its inherent non-periodic nature combined with off-line optimization of threshold values, our polyomino-based threshold structure shows blue-noise spectral properties. The halftone images produced with this threshold structure have high visual quality. Although the proposed method is general, and can be applied on any polyomino tiling, we consider one particular case: tiling with G-hexominoes. We compare our polyomino-based threshold structure with the best known state-of-the-art methods for generation threshold matrices, and conclude considerable improvement achieved with our method.","Vanderhaeghe, David;Ostromoukhov, Victor",ArXiv e-prints,"[X127eb5bad, X1633ea2b3, X2cbe2f46e, X39acf7a59, X62aef6841, Xbd2fe1c6c, Xc500db453]",X127eb5bad;X1633ea2b3;X2cbe2f46e;X39acf7a59;X62aef6841;Xbd2fe1c6c;Xc500db453,7,Polyomino-Based Digital Halftoning,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1647,2008
373,"Counting the number of all the matchings on a bipartite graph has been transformed into calculating the permanent of a matrix obtained from the extended bipartite graph by Yan Huo, and Rasmussen presents a simple approach (RM) to approximate the permanent, which just yields a critical ratio O($n\omega(n)$) for almost all the 0-1 matrices, provided it's a simple promising practical way to compute this #P-complete problem. In this paper, the performance of this method will be shown when it's applied to compute all the matchings based on that transformation. The critical ratio will be proved to be very large with a certain probability, owning an increasing factor larger than any polynomial of $n$ even in the sense for almost all the 0-1 matrices. Hence, RM fails to work well when counting all the matchings via computing the permanent of the matrix. In other words, we must carefully utilize the known methods of estimating the permanent to count all the matchings through that transformation.","Zhang, Jinshan",ArXiv e-prints,[],,0,An analysis of a random algorithm for estimating all the matchings,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1119,2008

377,"The quality of a simulator equipped with a haptic interface is given by the dynamical properties of its components: haptic interface, simulator and control system. Some application areas of such kind of simulator like musical synthesis, animation or more general, instrumental art have specific requirements as for the ""haptic rendering"" of small movements that go beyond the usual haptic interfaces allow. Object properties variability and different situations of object combination represent important aspects of such type of application which makes that the user can be interested as much in the restitution of certain global properties of an entire object domain as in the restitution of properties that are specific to an isolate object. In the traditional approaches, the usual criteria are founded on the paradigm of transparency and are related to the impedance error introduced by the technical aspects of the system. As a general aim, rather than to minimize these effects, we look to characterize them by physical metaphors conferring to haptic medium the role of a tool.

379,"This paper presents a modeling process in order to produce a realistic simulation of crowds in the ancient Greek agora of Argos. This place was a social theater in which two kinds of collective phenomena took place: interpersonal interactions (small group discussion and negotiation, etc.) and global collective phenomena, such as flowing and jamming. In this paper, we focus on the second type of collective human phenomena, called non-deliberative emergent crowd phenomena. This is a typical case of collective emergent self-organization. When a great number of individuals move within a confined environment and under a common fate, collective structures appear spontaneously: jamming with inner collapses, organized flowing with queues, curls, and vortices, propagation effects, etc. These are particularly relevant features to enhance the realism - more precisely the ""truthfulness"" - of models of this kind of collective phenomena. We assume that this truthfulness is strongly associated with the concept of emergence: evolutions are not predetermined by the individual characters, but emerge from the interaction of numerous characters. The evolutions are not repetitive, and evolve on the basis of small changes. This paper demonstrates that the physically-based interacting particles system is an adequate candidate to model emergent crowd effects: it associates a large number of elementary dynamic actors via elementary non-linear dynamic interactions. Our model of the scene is regulated as a large, dynamically coupled network of second order differential automata. We take advantage of symbolic non-photorealistic and efficient visualization to render the style of the person, rather than the person itself. As an artistic representation, NPR reinforces the symbolic acceptance of the scene by the observer, triggering an immediate and intuitive recognition of the scene as a plausible scene from ancient Greece.","Heïgeas, Laure;Luciani, Annie;Thollot, Joëlle;Castagné, Nicolas",ArXiv e-prints,"[X069ca4de8, X09057f00b, X0d3a51dd7, X142f48004, X1c90504d6, X2a54730ff, X30d0a2918, X69ec09569, X6b78259ac, X789674693, X78b7344e6, X7b16910b9, X80874889c, X829986e4c, X8764769fb, X882e7a6f8, X97e4c2aaa, X9906a4883, X99693601d, X9e33b8529, Xa3a46f3df, Xa4e54c3c3, Xb26c36f5e, Xb37b8e56e, Xb58beeee8, Xba4e0ea4b, Xc4e1c2d90, Xc70d8c877, Xc92074df5, Xd72128c3e, Xd7ed58046, Xdf93a0c4b, Xe76de8adf, Xf3e1941e7, Xf8fc3bb68, Xfcddca38b]",X069ca4de8;X09057f00b;X0d3a51dd7;X142f48004;X1c90504d6;X2a54730ff;X30d0a2918;X69ec09569;X6b78259ac;X789674693;X78b7344e6;X7b16910b9;X80874889c;X829986e4c;X8764769fb;X882e7a6f8;X97e4c2aaa;X9906a4883;X99693601d;X9e33b8529;Xa3a46f3df;Xa4e54c3c3;Xb26c36f5e;Xb37b8e56e;Xb58beeee8;Xba4e0ea4b;Xc4e1c2d90;Xc70d8c877;Xc92074df5;Xd72128c3e;Xd7ed58046;Xdf93a0c4b;Xe76de8adf;Xf3e1941e7;Xf8fc3bb68;Xfcddca38b,36,A physically-based particle model of emergent crowd behaviors,http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4405,2010

383,"The question of encoding movements such as those produced by human gestures may become central in the coming years, given the growing importance of movement data exchanges between heterogeneous systems and applications (musical applications, 3D motion control, virtual reality interaction, etc.). For the past 20 years, various formats have been proposed for encoding movement, especially gestures. Though, these formats, at different degrees, were designed in the context of quite specific applications (character animation, motion capture, musical gesture, biomechanical concerns...). The article introduce a new file format, called GMS (for 'Gesture and Motion Signal'), with the aim of being more low-level and generic, by defining the minimal features a format carrying movement/gesture information needs, rather than by gathering all the information generally given by the existing formats. The article argues that, given its growing presence in virtual reality situations, the ""gesture signal"" itself must be encoded, and that a specific format is needed.

We show that this problem is NP-hard, even for manifolds without boundary and for punctured spheres. We also describe an algorithm with running time n^{O(g+k)}, where n is the combinatorial complexity, g is the genus, and k is the number of boundary components of the input surface.

389,"We consider the problem of computing accurate point-to-point correspondences among a set of human face scans with varying expressions. Our fully automatic approach does not require any manually placed markers on the scan. Instead, the approach learns the locations of a set of landmarks present in a database and uses this knowledge to automatically predict the locations of these landmarks on a newly available scan. The predicted landmarks are then used to compute point-to-point correspondences between a template model and the newly available scan. To accurately fit the expression of the template to the expression of the scan, we use as template a blendshape model. Our algorithm was tested on a database of human faces of different ethnic groups with strongly varying expressions. Experimental results show that the obtained point-to-point correspondence is both highly accurate and consistent for most of the tested 3D face models.","Salazar, Augusto;Wuhrer, Stefanie;Shu, Chang;Prieto, Flavio",ArXiv e-prints,"[5545629592, X00fa7a190, X02eece0d8, X0334ff701, X0948d85e7, X13503c58a, X13a5d66bf, X18dc4b3e7, X1952a2f22, X22fa40249, X272842d09, X28254a015, X2bd414e0b, X2ef0dfe1d, X35dcd8fd1, X3b41c8d96, X3b5fcaa6c, X42345df31, X443fff915, X471fc699a, X4852447fc, X4ce677b5f, X4ce718d76, X4e82fffb6, X54869ed3e, X54b2a5f9a, X552fe4535, X5532a1d8f, X56a42e0a7, X573598f19, X6452fb912, X6588090ac, X677ea3074, X692fd8af2, X6ab8d94e2, X6faa64838, X703c56a5b, X715b98aed, X71c8e73cc, X72ab42427, X7a2ee39fc, X7fa6e22e5, X84d313e5c, X851a46f23, X8985d2637, X8d666fae4, X8f599b0e7, X92260df04, X9771d8af5, X9bd57348e, Xa00524190, Xa013b3478, Xa01f5e82d, Xa0e57b0cc, Xa2224b2a6, Xad069d522, Xaed5f7894, Xb5c8db97d, Xc01213e6e, Xc1054d9f6, Xc19f4fd0f, Xceb69c0f0, Xd1909851a, Xd48e9e83d, Xd50869bf4, Xd84ff8e16, Xe09905de8, Xe676c2b33, Xee1757997, Xf681d127c, Xfa53f7843]",5545629592;X00fa7a190;X02eece0d8;X0334ff701;X0948d85e7;X13503c58a;X13a5d66bf;X18dc4b3e7;X1952a2f22;X22fa40249;X272842d09;X28254a015;X2bd414e0b;X2ef0dfe1d;X35dcd8fd1;X3b41c8d96;X3b5fcaa6c;X42345df31;X443fff915;X471fc699a;X4852447fc;X4ce677b5f;X4ce718d76;X4e82fffb6;X54869ed3e;X54b2a5f9a;X552fe4535;X5532a1d8f;X56a42e0a7;X573598f19;X6452fb912;X6588090ac;X677ea3074;X692fd8af2;X6ab8d94e2;X6faa64838;X703c56a5b;X715b98aed;X71c8e73cc;X72ab42427;X7a2ee39fc;X7fa6e22e5;X84d313e5c;X851a46f23;X8985d2637;X8d666fae4;X8f599b0e7;X92260df04;X9771d8af5;X9bd57348e;Xa00524190;Xa013b3478;Xa01f5e82d;Xa0e57b0cc;Xa2224b2a6;Xad069d522;Xaed5f7894;Xb5c8db97d;Xc01213e6e;Xc1054d9f6;Xc19f4fd0f;Xceb69c0f0;Xd1909851a;Xd48e9e83d;Xd50869bf4;Xd84ff8e16;Xe09905de8;Xe676c2b33;Xee1757997;Xf681d127c;Xfa53f7843,71,Fully Automatic Expression-Invariant Face Correspondence,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1444,2012

The proposed minimal surfaces also have some interesting properties such as symmetry, containing straight lines and self-intersections.

392,"A Modern Graphics Processing unit (GPU) is able to perform massively parallel scientific computations at low cost. We extend our implementation of the checkerboard algorithm for the two-dimensional Ising model [T. Preis et al., Journal of Chemical Physics 228 (2009) 4468-4477] in order to overcome the memory limitations of a single GPU which enables us to simulate significantly larger systems. Using multi-spin coding techniques, we are able to accelerate simulations on a single GPU by factors up to 35 compared to an optimized single Central Processor Unit (CPU) core implementation which employs multi-spin coding. By combining the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) with the Message Parsing Interface (MPI) on the CPU level, a single Ising lattice can be updated by a cluster of GPUs in parallel. For large systems, the computation time scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs used. As proof of concept we reproduce the critical temperature of the 2D Ising model using finite size scaling techniques.","Block, Benjamin;Virnau, Peter;Preis, Tobias",Computer Physics Communications,"[X0167207f0, X09bb9cb12, X0d1b69ce5, X111e0c386, X13891c0ae, X1fd590b69, X2ca5feb32, X33580892d, X398c24349, X41242ea23, X4bf4620bb, X4ee60c45c, X53571b105, X551881d95, X5715839c7, X588f92d14, X594f3cef2, X5af1ff7a9, X5c4d8ae3f, X5e5c042ac, X600339b87, X6248a5e8d, X63bc32577, X6d3731999, X834ef50f4, X854b10532, X877d4473c, X9759b58c3, X9a33a65a8, X9c4a8b758, X9ca737651, Xa62d9146b, Xab2ab6ecb, Xaeb600a8a, Xb3417315b, Xb6badc99e, Xbe36ff108, Xd439789fe, Xda88e3679, Xdc7d09605, Xea625c697, Xed27642bd, Xf05d3d849, Xfaaf8bf94]",X0167207f0;X09bb9cb12;X0d1b69ce5;X111e0c386;X13891c0ae;X1fd590b69;X2ca5feb32;X33580892d;X398c24349;X41242ea23;X4bf4620bb;X4ee60c45c;X53571b105;X551881d95;X5715839c7;X588f92d14;X594f3cef2;X5af1ff7a9;X5c4d8ae3f;X5e5c042ac;X600339b87;X6248a5e8d;X63bc32577;X6d3731999;X834ef50f4;X854b10532;X877d4473c;X9759b58c3;X9a33a65a8;X9c4a8b758;X9ca737651;Xa62d9146b;Xab2ab6ecb;Xaeb600a8a;Xb3417315b;Xb6badc99e;Xbe36ff108;Xd439789fe;Xda88e3679;Xdc7d09605;Xea625c697;Xed27642bd;Xf05d3d849;Xfaaf8bf94,44,Multi-GPU accelerated multi-spin Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D Ising model,http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3726,2010
393,"The basic objective of data visualization is to provide an efficient graphical display for summarizing and reasoning about quantitative information. During the last decades, political science has accumulated a large corpus of various kinds of data such as comprehensive factbooks and atlases, characterizing all or most of existing states by multiple and objectively assessed numerical indicators within certain time lapse. As a consequence, there exists a continuous trend for political science to gradually become a more quantitative scientific field and to use quantitative information in the analysis and reasoning. It is believed that any objective analysis in political science must be multidimensional and combine various sources of quantitative information; however, human capabilities for perception of large massifs of numerical information are limited. Hence, methods and approaches for visualization of quantitative and qualitative data (and, especially multivariate data) is an extremely important topic. Data visualization approaches can be classified into several groups, starting from creating informative charts and diagrams (statistical graphics and infographics) and ending with advanced statistical methods for visualizing multidimensional tables containing both quantitative and qualitative information. In this article we provide a short review of existing methods of data visualization methods with applications in political and social science.","Zinovyev, Andrei",ArXiv e-prints,"[X010efb2df, X01b764b81, X02cce5490, X04714dfbc, X054317301, X085e51221, X0b35d942e, X0dfc95df3, X13542804f, X149099888, X1569406c3, X18e62fbf2, X1d97251af, X1fe6a497d, X2196a6117, X2373d220f, X2387e7690, X265a495de, X2e0e57e90, X2e5b137c7, X2f3ca1a58, X3043fc2f7, X318494248, X31a0c941a, X3607a3e29, X400e069fc, X413887587, X4579bbb74, X47af4d401, X47cbb9183, X48221d263, X485fbc9f5, X4f21eeeec, X51d5b3ccd, X5299380df, X52f9f6b1f, X530cddd4f, X5445e8ce0, X55d93e321, X5a316c45a, X5a69ec59b, X5bcba41b6, X5c8b70330, X5cf956909, X5d5a26ef0, X5e059a7af, X5ed05d7e0, X6077f2311, X6548843e6, X65b38a1eb, X65d2a535b, X6bbc67650, X6e070eab1, X6fff5993a, X749ffe5cb, X75fe6aed6, X7880a57d4, X79346586c, X7d299f86a, X7d29baa5f, X7d8316e55, X7e3bc0a18, X81092d0db, X8577f6193, X87ae7879b, X87b668f65, X8efc5c1c6, X8f44219c2, X911848fed, X917b58544, X91a5af92c, X93f4c41b4, X95799f677, X96142ad14, X98fbff1ec, Xa02ef9c63, Xa14f38f4b, Xa21b8d443, Xa27cbf349, Xa30bc34f8, Xa4d3c3ac1, Xa7289be7c, Xa99748b6c, Xa9e59db6d, Xad9464a1b, Xaf7e7f028, Xb0cdd3639, Xb155df28a, Xb16fe28ae, Xb68565324, Xb9205e2af, Xbc915ef9d, Xbee26ac3f, Xc0925a184, Xc121be681, Xc1fff8dc6, Xc24b4d037, Xc5b5d0e0e, Xc8bb83986, Xcb9202c8d, ...]",X010efb2df;X01b764b81;X02cce5490;X04714dfbc;X054317301;X085e51221;X0b35d942e;X0dfc95df3;X13542804f;X149099888;X1569406c3;X18e62fbf2;X1d97251af;X1fe6a497d;X2196a6117;X2373d220f;X2387e7690;X265a495de;X2e0e57e90;X2e5b137c7;X2f3ca1a58;X3043fc2f7;X318494248;X31a0c941a;X3607a3e29;X400e069fc;X413887587;X4579bbb74;X47af4d401;X47cbb9183;X48221d263;X485fbc9f5;X4f21eeeec;X51d5b3ccd;X5299380df;X52f9f6b1f;X530cddd4f;X5445e8ce0;X55d93e321;X5a316c45a;X5a69ec59b;X5bcba41b6;X5c8b70330;X5cf956909;X5d5a26ef0;X5e059a7af;X5ed05d7e0;X6077f2311;X6548843e6;X65b38a1eb;X65d2a535b;X6bbc67650;X6e070eab1;X6fff5993a;X749ffe5cb;X75fe6aed6;X7880a57d4;X79346586c;X7d299f86a;X7d29baa5f;X7d8316e55;X7e3bc0a18;X81092d0db;X8577f6193;X87ae7879b;X87b668f65;X8efc5c1c6;X8f44219c2;X911848fed;X917b58544;X91a5af92c;X93f4c41b4;X95799f677;X96142ad14;X98fbff1ec;Xa02ef9c63;Xa14f38f4b;Xa21b8d443;Xa27cbf349;Xa30bc34f8;Xa4d3c3ac1;Xa7289be7c;Xa99748b6c;Xa9e59db6d;Xad9464a1b;Xaf7e7f028;Xb0cdd3639;Xb155df28a;Xb16fe28ae;Xb68565324;Xb9205e2af;Xbc915ef9d;Xbee26ac3f;Xc0925a184;Xc121be681;Xc1fff8dc6;Xc24b4d037;Xc5b5d0e0e;Xc8bb83986;Xcb9202c8d;Xcc8586e6e;Xcd4a0db65;Xce8a25e4a;Xced6f3cc4;Xcfeabe78e;Xd0b69cf6b;Xd2e5859e0;Xd383959f4;Xd71c2b668;Xd72c0fd89;Xd816a87a9;Xd964999ff;Xe14db3b0e;Xe1c3f54e0;Xe25626238;Xe35124e14;Xe4f8605b7;Xe6884dc13;Xe7925a8f3;Xea6785d55;Xeaf0951c5;Xedc2a2cd8;Xf347ae7e6;Xf34b7565c;Xf3a0b3d96;Xf4508002a;Xfccaf1676;Xfe1ecb680;Xfe5534078;Xff8833de5,130,Data visualization in political and social sciences,http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1188,2010
394,"Automatic video segmentation plays an important role in a wide range of computer vision and image processing applications. Recently, various methods have been proposed for this purpose. The problem is that most of these methods are far from real-time processing even for low-resolution videos due to the complex procedures. To this end, we propose a new and quite fast method for automatic video segmentation with the help of 1) efficient optimization of Markov random fields with polynomial time of number of pixels by introducing graph cuts, 2) automatic, computationally efficient but stable derivation of segmentation priors using visual saliency and sequential update mechanism, and 3) an implementation strategy in the principle of stream processing with graphics processor units (GPUs). Test results indicates that our method extracts appropriate regions from videos as precisely as and much faster than previous semi-automatic methods even though any supervisions have not been incorporated.","Kazuma, Akamine;Fukuchi, Ken;Kimura, Akisato;Takagi, Shigeru",ArXiv e-prints,"[X178cca8d1, X182115483, X34614fe8c, X53bf5ada8, X5e3dd2a28, X5faabe610, X632e460e9, X6c58ea15a, X810b76e33, X8b409f409, X9898ffe69, Xa243cbeb5, Xb1d11d1cf, Xc87225a5b, Xd4e423985, Xd6511aa3f, Xec972fbea]",X178cca8d1;X182115483;X34614fe8c;X53bf5ada8;X5e3dd2a28;X5faabe610;X632e460e9;X6c58ea15a;X810b76e33;X8b409f409;X9898ffe69;Xa243cbeb5;Xb1d11d1cf;Xc87225a5b;Xd4e423985;Xd6511aa3f;Xec972fbea,17,Fully automatic extraction of salient objects from videos in near real-time,http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0502,2010
395,"Scientific data sets continue to increase in both size and complexity. In the past, dedicated graphics systems at supercomputing centers were required to visualize large data sets, but as the price of commodity graphics hardware has dropped and its capability has increased, it is now possible, in principle, to view large complex data sets on a single workstation. To do this in practice, an investigator will need software that is written to take advantage of the relevant graphics hardware. The Viewpoints visualization package described herein is an example of such software. Viewpoints is an interactive tool for exploratory visual analysis of large high-dimensional (multivariate) data. It leverages the capabilities of modern graphics boards (GPUs) to run on a single workstation or laptop. Viewpoints is minimalist: it attempts to do a small set of useful things very well (or at least very quickly) in comparison with similar packages today. Its basic feature set includes linked scatter plots with brushing, dynamic histograms, normalization, and outlier detection/removal. Viewpoints was originally designed for astrophysicists, but it has since been used in a variety of fields that range from astronomy, quantum chemistry, fluid dynamics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and finance to information technology server log mining. In this article, we describe the Viewpoints package and show examples of its usage.","Gazis, P. R.;Levit, C.;Way, M.

398,"New generations of neutron scattering sources and instrumentation are providing challenges in data handling for user software. Time-of-Flight instruments used at pulsed sources typically produce hundreds or thousands of channels of data for each detector segment. New instruments are being designed with thousands to hundreds of thousands of detector segments. High intensity neutron sources make possible parametric studies and texture studies which further increase data handling requirements. The Integrated Spectral Analysis Workbench (ISAW) software developed at Argonne handles large numbers of spectra simultaneously while providing operations to reduce, sort, combine and export the data. It includes viewers to inspect the data in detail in real time. ISAW uses existing software components and packages where feasible and takes advantage of the excellent support for user interface design and network communication in Java. The included scripting language simplifies repetitive operations for analyzing many files related to a given experiment. Recent additions to ISAW include a contour view, a time-slice table view, routines for finding and fitting peaks in data, and support for data from other facilities using the NeXus format. In this paper, I give an overview of features and planned improvements of ISAW. Details of some of the improvements are covered in other presentations at this conference.","Worlton, T.

403,"Understanding constellations in large data collections has become a common task. One obstacle a user has to overcome is the internal complexity of these repositories. For example, extracting connected data from a normalized relational database requires knowledge of the table structure which might not be available for the casual user. In this paper we present a visualization framework which presents the collection as a set of entities and relations (on the data level). Using rating functions, we divide large relation networks into small graphs which resemble ego-centered networks. These graphs are connected so the user can browse from one to another. To further assist the user, we present two views which embed information on the evolution of the relations into the graphs. Each view emphasizes another aspect of temporal development. The framework can be adapted to any repository by a flexible data interface and a graph configuration file.

404,"In this and the associated article 'BioBlender: Fast and Efficient All Atom Morphing of Proteins Using Blender Game Engine', by Zini et al., we present BioBlender, a complete instrument for the elaboration of motion (Zini et al.) and the visualization (here) of proteins and other macromolecules, using instruments of computer graphics. The availability of protein structures enables the study of their surfaces and surface properties such as electrostatic potential (EP) and hydropathy (MLP), based on atomic contribution. Recent advances in 3D animation and rendering software have not yet been exploited for the representation of proteins and other biological molecules in an intuitive, animated form. Taking advantage of an open-source, 3D animation and rendering software, Blender, we developed BioBlender, a package dedicated to biological work: elaboration of proteins' motions with the simultaneous visualization of chemical and physical features. EP and MLP are calculated using physico-chemical programs and custom programs and scripts, organized and accessed within BioBlender interface. A new visual code is introduced for MLP visualization: a range of optical features that permits a photorealistic rendering of its spatial distribution on the surface of the protein. EP is represented as animated line particles that flow along field lines proportional to the total charge of the protein. Our system permits EP and MLP visualization of molecules and, in the case of moving proteins, the continuous perception of these features, calculated for each intermediate conformation. Using real world tactile/sight feelings, the nanoscale world of proteins becomes more understandable, familiar to our everyday life, making it easier to introduce ""un-seen"" phenomena (concepts) such as hydropathy or charges.","Andrei, Raluca Mihaela;Callieri, Marco;Zini, Maria Francesca;Loni, Tiziana;Maraziti, Giuseppe;Pan, Mike Chen;Zoppè, Monica",ArXiv e-prints,"[550b5d13f4, X0d496d580, X108351794, X118dc0eea, X22022be9b, X2281073ab, X233debad5, X27b9bb8dc, X38f73cf5f, X46b42df00, X4e4307585, X4ef059fd5, X567a3075c, X58e55c0a2, X66bb57c2d, X67f35d3fd, X6ccea7482, X7491e60db, X764c2b5c9, X7a7361921, X8473acd1d, X89f0d9eec, X8c28c88da, X928779e83, X9c4b563b3, X9daeeb7a0, Xa71562600, Xa830d7d56, Xb26e8be27, Xb65dcc4bf, Xb96ec4e59, Xbf375af03, Xc4f59a0b7, Xc5344b804, Xc7054e235, Xc7b9d48fe, Xc7fa5e2d9, Xca129efd4, Xca2a34c20, Xce52c9f5a, Xd84616f2c, Xdae2fea49, Xdb16a3fb6, Xdb1b6d78b, Xde9aaa813, Xe092e6117, Xe2a7cc2ac, Xf08a7be8a, Xf2c77b6a5, Xf2fe839f8, Xfe91b17db]",550b5d13f4;X0d496d580;X108351794;X118dc0eea;X22022be9b;X2281073ab;X233debad5;X27b9bb8dc;X38f73cf5f;X46b42df00;X4e4307585;X4ef059fd5;X567a3075c;X58e55c0a2;X66bb57c2d;X67f35d3fd;X6ccea7482;X7491e60db;X764c2b5c9;X7a7361921;X8473acd1d;X89f0d9eec;X8c28c88da;X928779e83;X9c4b563b3;X9daeeb7a0;Xa71562600;Xa830d7d56;Xb26e8be27;Xb65dcc4bf;Xb96ec4e59;Xbf375af03;Xc4f59a0b7;Xc5344b804;Xc7054e235;Xc7b9d48fe;Xc7fa5e2d9;Xca129efd4;Xca2a34c20;Xce52c9f5a;Xd84616f2c;Xdae2fea49;Xdb16a3fb6;Xdb1b6d78b;Xde9aaa813;Xe092e6117;Xe2a7cc2ac;Xf08a7be8a;Xf2c77b6a5;Xf2fe839f8;Xfe91b17db,51,Intuitive representation of surface properties of biomolecules using BioBlender,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4674,2010

The proposed analytical solution depicts a novel way of solving the point in polygon problem by employing the properties of epigraphs and hypographs, explicitly. Contrary to the ambiguous solutions given by the cross over for the simple and self intersecting polygons and the solution of a point being multiply inside a self intersecting polygon given by the winding number rule, the current solution gives unambiguous and singular result for both kinds of polygons. Finally, the current theoretical solution proves to be mathematically correct for simple and self intersecting polygons.","Sinha, Shriprakash;Nanetti, Luca",ArXiv e-prints,"[X87b34b86b, X8c1b2ba5d, Xb3f60b95b, Xe0aa71d78]",X87b34b86b;X8c1b2ba5d;Xb3f60b95b;Xe0aa71d78,4,Inaccessibility-Inside Theorem for Point in Polygon,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0552,2010
406,"Lucid programs are data-flow programs and can be visually represented as data flow graphs (DFGs) and composed visually. Forensic Lucid, a Lucid dialect, is a language to specify and reason about cyberforensic cases. It includes the encoding of the evidence (representing the context of evaluation) and the crime scene modeling in order to validate claims against the model and perform event reconstruction, potentially within large swaths of digital evidence. To aid investigators to model the scene and evaluate it, instead of typing a Forensic Lucid program, we propose to expand the design and implementation of the Lucid DFG programming onto Forensic Lucid case modeling and specification to enhance the usability of the language and the system and its behavior. We briefly discuss the related work on visual programming an DFG modeling in an attempt to define and select one approach or a composition of approaches for Forensic Lucid based on various criteria such as previous implementation, wide use, formal backing in terms of semantics and translation. In the end, we solicit the readers' constructive, opinions, feedback, comments, and recommendations within the context of this short discussion.","Mokhov, Serguei A.;Paquet, Joey;Debbabi, Mourad",ArXiv e-prints,"[X119ece49e, X6945b828d, X7452f44fe, X833fcc513, X8cef178e4, X933b93513, X93f88bbc5, Xac44e60df, Xc0f1827f5, Xd19d5a54c, Xedcbc0406, Xfa6eee668]",X119ece49e;X6945b828d;X7452f44fe;X833fcc513;X8cef178e4;X933b93513;X93f88bbc5;Xac44e60df;Xc0f1827f5;Xd19d5a54c;Xedcbc0406;Xfa6eee668,12,"The Need to Support of Data Flow Graph Visualization of Forensic Lucid Programs, Forensic Evidence, and their Evaluation by GIPSY",http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5423,2010
407,"Color quantization is an important operation with numerous applications in graphics and image processing. Most quantization methods are essentially based on data clustering algorithms. However, despite its popularity as a general purpose clustering algorithm, k-means has not received much respect in the color quantization literature because of its high computational requirements and sensitivity to initialization. In this paper, a fast color quantization method based on k-means is presented. The method involves several modifications to the conventional (batch) k-means algorithm including data reduction, sample weighting, and the use of triangle inequality to speed up the nearest neighbor search. Experiments on a diverse set of images demonstrate that, with the proposed modifications, k-means becomes very competitive with state-of-the-art color quantization methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.","Celebi, M.

These points of non-conformality cause significant artifacts in photographic applications. In this paper, we propose an algorithm and user-interface to mitigate these artifacts. Moreover, in order to facilitate an interactive user-interface, we present a fast algorithm for calculating the Peirce quincuncial projection. We then promote the Peirce quincuncial projection as a viable alternative to the more popular stereographic projection in some scenarios.","Fong, Chamberlain;Vogel, Brian K.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X041cf3d10, X0490dbc72, X0a39df6e7, X0aec4bf4e, X0d24061bc, X0dc4688fb, X0e03bed21, X1132d02ae, X11d4dcc73, X1290fccd5, X12d9ebe08, X147a59c16, X192aa2365, X193e76db8, X1d5bbc943, X1e3061359, X226b9a48e, X285ad1b2e, X28fda9da1, X29901ad9e, X2b7173603, X2c4009536, X2cc986caa, X2e9de2e6b, X347930afb, X39bee2ba9, X3cbb03c5f, X3fe501094, X450571994, X4566d21f7, X47fede4c7, X4a530c133, X4a92765e6, X4d5df2002, X4db6ee644, X574549796, X5814a1c49, X5f0f7c28d, X61aceca05, X63638f8eb, X6454291d5, X64de6878a, X650cf77de, X695286402, X6c2bcf244, X6ca65f5e3, X6f6fab0c7, X70c29805c, X7115fae5f, X7267c4506, X765a75b1e, X7863843f3, X7f5d9a1e0, X7ff67262a, X898659dfa, X8a0d61e56, X8af883b7e, X8e02e96d5, X8fc5a62e7, X932fc0ca3, X93686822a, X93e046294, X948c5669d, X961f36e3f, X97d8db732, X9973bda9e, X9a6c67df0, X9d256819f, X9fbbc121d, Xa22d5fe90, Xa5e71cf4a, Xa86025755, Xa8c092bfa, Xa97ff6ae8, Xac7ec1634, Xb054205ce, Xb6f040506, Xb7797ffcd, Xbb2f2fe95, Xbfbed5270, Xc37d9c8b2, Xc9eddf390, Xcb9f56e50, Xcf154863d, Xd015c67a6, Xd0a36a887, Xd24d35924, Xd37428661, Xd880a93ea, Xdea5b2540, Xdf5337982, Xe0aa71d78, Xe2b900f99, Xe7b341426, Xe9e91d51c, Xee5526200, Xee904ed64, Xefa5d68c5, Xf25cd000c, Xf446d2efc, ...]",X041cf3d10;X0490dbc72;X0a39df6e7;X0aec4bf4e;X0d24061bc;X0dc4688fb;X0e03bed21;X1132d02ae;X11d4dcc73;X1290fccd5;X12d9ebe08;X147a59c16;X192aa2365;X193e76db8;X1d5bbc943;X1e3061359;X226b9a48e;X285ad1b2e;X28fda9da1;X29901ad9e;X2b7173603;X2c4009536;X2cc986caa;X2e9de2e6b;X347930afb;X39bee2ba9;X3cbb03c5f;X3fe501094;X450571994;X4566d21f7;X47fede4c7;X4a530c133;X4a92765e6;X4d5df2002;X4db6ee644;X574549796;X5814a1c49;X5f0f7c28d;X61aceca05;X63638f8eb;X6454291d5;X64de6878a;X650cf77de;X695286402;X6c2bcf244;X6ca65f5e3;X6f6fab0c7;X70c29805c;X7115fae5f;X7267c4506;X765a75b1e;X7863843f3;X7f5d9a1e0;X7ff67262a;X898659dfa;X8a0d61e56;X8af883b7e;X8e02e96d5;X8fc5a62e7;X932fc0ca3;X93686822a;X93e046294;X948c5669d;X961f36e3f;X97d8db732;X9973bda9e;X9a6c67df0;X9d256819f;X9fbbc121d;Xa22d5fe90;Xa5e71cf4a;Xa86025755;Xa8c092bfa;Xa97ff6ae8;Xac7ec1634;Xb054205ce;Xb6f040506;Xb7797ffcd;Xbb2f2fe95;Xbfbed5270;Xc37d9c8b2;Xc9eddf390;Xcb9f56e50;Xcf154863d;Xd015c67a6;Xd0a36a887;Xd24d35924;Xd37428661;Xd880a93ea;Xdea5b2540;Xdf5337982;Xe0aa71d78;Xe2b900f99;Xe7b341426;Xe9e91d51c;Xee5526200;Xee904ed64;Xefa5d68c5;Xf25cd000c;Xf446d2efc;Xf62d7e499;Xf714c2b7e;Xf8f44637b;Xfa88a70e4;Xfe2ce741e,105,Warping Peirce Quincuncial Panoramas,http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3189,2010
410,"In this paper we present a new method, which allows for the construction of triangular isosurfaces from three-dimensional data sets, such as 3D image data and/or numerical simulation data that are based on regularly shaped, cubic lattices. This novel volume-enclosing surface extraction technique, which has been named VESTA, can produce up to six different results due to the nature of the discretized 3D space under consideration. VESTA is neither template-based nor it is necessarily required to operate on 2x2x2 voxel cell neighborhoods only. The surface tiles are determined with a very fast and robust construction technique while potential ambiguities are detected and resolved. Here, we provide an in-depth comparison between VESTA and various versions of the well-known and very popular Marching Cubes algorithm for the very first time. In an application section, we demonstrate the extraction of VESTA isosurfaces for various data sets ranging from computer tomographic scan data to simulation data of relativistic hydrodynamic fireball expansions.","Schlei, B.

411,"Use of Virtual Interactive Techniques for personalized product design is described in this paper. Usually products are designed and built by considering general usage patterns and Prototyping is used to mimic the static or working behaviour of an actual product before manufacturing the product. The user does not have any control on the design of the product. Personalized design postpones design to a later stage. It allows for personalized selection of individual components by the user. This is implemented by displaying the individual components over a physical model constructed using Cardboard or Thermocol in the actual size and shape of the original product. The components of the equipment or product such as screen, buttons etc. are then projected using a projector connected to the computer into the physical model. Users can interact with the prototype like the original working equipment and they can select, shape, position the individual components displayed on the interaction panel using simple hand gestures. Computer Vision techniques as well as sound processing techniques are used to detect and recognize the user gestures captured using a web camera and microphone.","Zacharia, Kurien;Elias, Eldo P.;Mariam Varghese, Surekha",ArXiv e-prints,"[X161ada006, X5fa8c3d02, Xaeaa36eb8, Xc470468ba, Xe62ae493f, Xfa1d8c2db]",X161ada006;X5fa8c3d02;Xaeaa36eb8;Xc470468ba;Xe62ae493f;Xfa1d8c2db,6,Personalised product design using virtual interactive techniques,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1808,2012

414,"This paper derives strong relations that boundary curves of a smooth complex of patches have to obey when the patches are computed by local averaging. These relations restrict the choice of reparameterizations for geometric continuity. In particular, when one bicubic tensor-product B-spline patch is associated with each facet of a quadrilateral mesh with n-valent vertices and we do not want segments of the boundary curves forced to be linear, then the relations dictate the minimal number and multiplicity of knots: For general data, the tensor-product spline patches must have at least two internal double knots per edge to be able to model a G^1-conneced complex of C^1 splines. This lower bound on the complexity of any construction is proven to be sharp by suitably interpreting an existing surface construction. That is, we have a tight bound on the complexity of smoothing quad meshes with bicubic tensor-product B-spline patches.","Peters, Jorg;Fan, Jianhua",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01f4f3283, X15f106316, X29a13b225, X398043d97, X3ebb18fd8, X4dc30a000, X4eb835330, X736a3282d, X769734112, X7d1e37cf9, X80973cd86, X928daeea3, X93f68916c, Xa59fda134, Xa7856da67, Xabd737024, Xbba37158f, Xda92c21cf, Xddb45c0d8, Xf3d4a9195, Xfc8f1a2ec]",X01f4f3283;X15f106316;X29a13b225;X398043d97;X3ebb18fd8;X4dc30a000;X4eb835330;X736a3282d;X769734112;X7d1e37cf9;X80973cd86;X928daeea3;X93f68916c;Xa59fda134;Xa7856da67;Xabd737024;Xbba37158f;Xda92c21cf;Xddb45c0d8;Xf3d4a9195;Xfc8f1a2ec,21,On the Complexity of Smooth Spline Surfaces from Quad Meshes,http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.1226,2009

416,"In this paper, we consider rendering color videos using a non-photo-realistic art form technique commonly called stippling. Stippling is the art of rendering images using point sets, possibly with various attributes like sizes, elementary shapes, and colors. Producing nice stippling is attractive not only for the sake of image depiction but also because it yields a compact vectorial format for storing the semantic information of media. Moreover, stippling is by construction easily tunable to various device resolutions without suffering from bitmap sampling artifacts when resizing. The underlying core technique for stippling images is to compute a centroidal Voronoi tessellation on a well-designed underlying density. This density relates to the image content, and is used to compute a weighted Voronoi diagram. By considering videos as image sequences and initializing properly the stippling of one image by the result of its predecessor, one avoids undesirable point flickering artifacts and can produce stippled videos that nevertheless still exhibit noticeable artifacts. To overcome this, our method improves over the naive scheme by considering dynamic point creation and deletion according to the current scene semantic complexity, and show how to effectively vectorize video while adjusting for both color and contrast characteristics. Furthermore, we explain how to produce high quality stippled ``videos'' (eg., fully dynamic spatio-temporal point sets) for media containing various fading effects, like quick motions of objects or progressive shot changes. We report on practical performances of our implementation, and present several stippled video results rendered on-the-fly using our viewer that allows both spatio-temporal dynamic rescaling (eg., upscale vectorially frame rate).","Houit, Thomas;Nielsen, Frank",ArXiv e-prints,"[X04effcad4, X324d8e90c, X4157e801c, X7684d0f31, Xa48ab368d, Xf4f7e185f, Xf5f6e5024]",X04effcad4;X324d8e90c;X4157e801c;X7684d0f31;Xa48ab368d;Xf4f7e185f;Xf5f6e5024,7,Video Stippling,http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.6049,2010
417,"The very recent volume-enclosing surface extraction algorithm, VESTA, is revisited. VESTA is used to determine implicit surfaces that are potentially contained in 3D data sets, such as 3D image data and/or 3D simulation data. VESTA surfaces are non-degenerate, i.e., they always enclose a volume that is larger than zero and they never self-intersect, prior to a further processing, e.g., towards isosurfaces. In addition to its ability to deal with local cell ambiguities consistently - and thereby avoiding the accidental generation of holes in the final surfaces - the information of the interior and/or exterior of enclosed 3D volumes is propagated correctly to each of the final surface tiles. Particular emphasis is put here on the speed up of the original formulation of VESTA, while applying the algorithm to 2x2x2 voxel neighborhoods.","Schlei, B.

418,"Displays based on organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology are appearing on many mobile devices. Unlike liquid crystal displays (LCD), OLED displays consume dramatically different power for showing different colors. In particular, OLED displays are inefficient for showing bright colors. This has made them undesirable for mobile devices because much of the web content is of bright colors. To tackle this problem, we present the motivational studies, design, and realization of Chameleon, a color adaptive web browser that renders web pages with power-optimized color schemes under user-supplied constraints. Driven by the findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with important options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real-time, and accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a browser engine. According to measure-ments with OLED smartphones, Chameleon is able to re-duce average system power consumption for web browsing by 41% and reduce display power consumption by 64% without introducing any noticeable delay.","Dong, Mian;Zhong, Lin",ArXiv e-prints,"[X02c2a0784, X0707fa761, X13660f829, X1436e5e32, X14cca85f0, X15228880b, X21b8efe8f, X22e05e044, X2c8585ec7, X319921746, X3454c422a, X56182d95b, X5b5d2816b, X5bd06b74c, X65fb964ec, X6d1be79d0, X70c485664, X70ffa38cf, X71c2b3496, X74c1e3117, X8081f1a5c, X8c3cb8497, X9182076a9, X925bc6873, X9b72c0fb5, X9daa0cca4, X9f66ea333, Xc3c6b0dfb, Xc74a4705a, Xc935e6d37, Xd69b98c13, Xe35367ee1, Xe4cfd3a57, Xe8d4fea3e, Xee3aca169, Xee45295f6, Xf7de2931d]",X02c2a0784;X0707fa761;X13660f829;X1436e5e32;X14cca85f0;X15228880b;X21b8efe8f;X22e05e044;X2c8585ec7;X319921746;X3454c422a;X56182d95b;X5b5d2816b;X5bd06b74c;X65fb964ec;X6d1be79d0;X70c485664;X70ffa38cf;X71c2b3496;X74c1e3117;X8081f1a5c;X8c3cb8497;X9182076a9;X925bc6873;X9b72c0fb5;X9daa0cca4;X9f66ea333;Xc3c6b0dfb;Xc74a4705a;Xc935e6d37;Xd69b98c13;Xe35367ee1;Xe4cfd3a57;Xe8d4fea3e;Xee3aca169;Xee45295f6;Xf7de2931d,37,Chameleon: A Color-Adaptive Web Browser for Mobile OLED Displays,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1240,2010

424,"Color quantization is an important operation with many applications in graphics and image processing. Most quantization methods are essentially based on data clustering algorithms. However, despite its popularity as a general purpose clustering algorithm, k-means has not received much respect in the color quantization literature because of its high computational requirements and sensitivity to initialization. In this paper, we investigate the performance of k-means as a color quantizer. We implement fast and exact variants of k-means with several initialization schemes and then compare the resulting quantizers to some of the most popular quantizers in the literature. Experiments on a diverse set of images demonstrate that an efficient implementation of k-means with an appropriate initialization strategy can in fact serve as a very effective color quantizer.","Emre Celebi, M.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X06f24503b, X0904284d5, X0962594f7, X141eb7840, X14a94220d, X1d71d1531, X240d651fa, X24264d303, X26d726f90, X27dff8eb5, X299cf3488, X29f2fa097, X2e58c81f3, X35fd7acc2, X380bd9c03, X3af01d022, X3ef274e79, X3f0b50907, X4d636f170, X5075de513, X511140319, X52b584e12, X54b7616b7, X55833de15, X5617c716c, X5682714e2, X57ff12f6d, X5a6d8ea74, X6328749da, X64d4f135e, X67aa89bbc, X68e9718da, X693c92ae5, X6b7be675c, X6be67039b, X721a709c4, X755b9fe9b, X782327f3c, X7ac610761, X829f582a1, X85a1b41d8, X8a275a0cb, X8a407a8c7, X93b5c5a14, X9775dc343, X98044b633, X9868f667f, X9a3ab178f, X9bfe5075c, X9c43ad220, Xa1d778538, Xa729d981a, Xa85fd9b6b, Xa8663bf5b, Xb88cb7e2c, Xbbc5be2c4, Xbd345c026, Xbda929cf4, Xbe2daccca, Xc5cfe6e59, Xd336746a7, Xd46cd1153, Xd63e86c37, Xdf832e537, Xdf9d6a698, Xe8ea1e571, Xeed3d52d8, Xeedc77b87, Xf7d980aab, Xf98cc04d1, Xfcd906943]",X06f24503b;X0904284d5;X0962594f7;X141eb7840;X14a94220d;X1d71d1531;X240d651fa;X24264d303;X26d726f90;X27dff8eb5;X299cf3488;X29f2fa097;X2e58c81f3;X35fd7acc2;X380bd9c03;X3af01d022;X3ef274e79;X3f0b50907;X4d636f170;X5075de513;X511140319;X52b584e12;X54b7616b7;X55833de15;X5617c716c;X5682714e2;X57ff12f6d;X5a6d8ea74;X6328749da;X64d4f135e;X67aa89bbc;X68e9718da;X693c92ae5;X6b7be675c;X6be67039b;X721a709c4;X755b9fe9b;X782327f3c;X7ac610761;X829f582a1;X85a1b41d8;X8a275a0cb;X8a407a8c7;X93b5c5a14;X9775dc343;X98044b633;X9868f667f;X9a3ab178f;X9bfe5075c;X9c43ad220;Xa1d778538;Xa729d981a;Xa85fd9b6b;Xa8663bf5b;Xb88cb7e2c;Xbbc5be2c4;Xbd345c026;Xbda929cf4;Xbe2daccca;Xc5cfe6e59;Xd336746a7;Xd46cd1153;Xd63e86c37;Xdf832e537;Xdf9d6a698;Xe8ea1e571;Xeed3d52d8;Xeedc77b87;Xf7d980aab;Xf98cc04d1;Xfcd906943,71,Improving the Performance of K-Means for Color Quantization,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0395,2011
425,"Many state-of-the art visualization techniques must be tailored to the specific type of dataset, its modality (CT, MRI, etc.), the recorded object or anatomical region (head, spine, abdomen, etc.) and other parameters related to the data acquisition process. While parts of the information (imaging modality and acquisition sequence) may be obtained from the meta-data stored with the volume scan, there is important information which is not stored explicitly (anatomical region, tracing compound). Also, meta-data might be incomplete, inappropriate or simply missing. This paper presents a novel and simple method of determining the type of dataset from previously defined categories. 2D histograms based on intensity and gradient magnitude of datasets are used as input to a neural network, which classifies it into one of several categories it was trained with. The proposed method is an important building block for visualization systems to be used autonomously by non-experts. The method has been tested on 80 datasets, divided into 3 classes and a ""rest"" class. A significant result is the ability of the system to classify datasets into a specific class after being trained with only one dataset of that class. Other advantages of the method are its easy implementation and its high computational performance.","Zukić, Dženan;Rezk-Salama, Christof;Kolb, Andreas",ArXiv e-prints,"[55262eadab, X507dad59b, X5d28cdec1, X65db559ff, X6a25d8b87, X6d0fd23bf, X7fe269218, X93f6601ed, Xd1bbe19f5]",55262eadab;X507dad59b;X5d28cdec1;X65db559ff;X6a25d8b87;X6d0fd23bf;X7fe269218;X93f6601ed;Xd1bbe19f5,9,A Neural Network Classifier of Volume Datasets,http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2274,2009

We compute conformal structures in the following way: first compute homology bases from simplicial complex structures, then construct dual cohomology bases and diffuse them to harmonic 1-forms. Next, we construct bases of holomorphic differentials. We then obtain period matrices by integrating holomorphic differentials along homology bases. We also study the global conformal mapping between genus zero surfaces and spheres, and between general meshes and planes. Our method of computing conformal structures can be applied to tackle fundamental problems in computer aid design and computer graphics, such as geometry classification and identification, and surface global parametrization.","Gu, Xianfeng;Yau, Shing-Tung",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0537c1c82, X08239048d, X1d5bbc943, X2ca0ca253, X3143079bc, X3df06a147, X4adb569a4, X57e8a5b5a, X5d2bda555, X5d93ff219, X722e763a4, X974c4b07a, Xa7e23c2fc, Xac85a5ca3, Xd35eddbe0, Xd94bddbfb, Xfb9330f20]",X0537c1c82;X08239048d;X1d5bbc943;X2ca0ca253;X3143079bc;X3df06a147;X4adb569a4;X57e8a5b5a;X5d2bda555;X5d93ff219;X722e763a4;X974c4b07a;Xa7e23c2fc;Xac85a5ca3;Xd35eddbe0;Xd94bddbfb;Xfb9330f20,17,Computing Conformal Structure of Surfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0212043,2002
427,"We discuss a topic on the role of computer graphics in the production of documentaries, which is often ignored in favor of other topics. Typically, except for some rare occasions, documentary producers and computer scientists or digital artists that do computer graphics are relatively far apart in their domains and rarely intercommunicate to have a joint production; yet it happens, and perhaps more so in the present and the future. We attempt to classify the documentaries on the amount and techniques of computer graphics used for documentaries. We come up with the initial categories such as ""plain"" (no graphics), ""in-between"", ""all-out"" -- nearly 100% of the documentary consisting of computer-generated imagery. Computer graphics can be used to enhance the scenery, fill in the gaps in the missing storyline pieces, or animate between scenes. It can incorporate stereoscopic effects for higher viewer impression as well as interactivity aspects. It can also be used simply in old archived image and film restoration.","Song, Miao",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0046dbb1d, X02f309050, X03b8af3fb, X04f497df4, X0b27e7870, X0be0ac600, X0d9e7a81b, X0dbbb0972, X0de023e00, X0f6d3c037, X11d3140b6, X1201f5345, X12897dcd5, X12e11ca02, X12eb007df, X13c1e56dc, X163f97354, X16573220e, X16c04d806, X183066d06, X192dc259b, X1c572b5b0, X1d18e9c76, X1dfd88a4e, X212cdcd84, X21c8a83bc, X2213b3eac, X22f2b24d2, X249ae746a, X2a0d27d9c, X2b02158ff, X2bf6c66bd, X2c214bec3, X2c6f6ea80, X2ecd43c0f, X2ff46de95, X31b09fca5, X32f47ff60, X33cfc84ea, X356043d86, X35f454fdf, X36b66ee6e, X379686384, X3900b54d1, X3ae2bcabc, X3f3668b82, X3fefb7be5, X41966bda2, X43769ee09, X448ded7d7, X44e5ee1da, X46042e4ea, X481627be6, X494b52966, X4aaadcf3f, X4ddcc2e34, X4e799405e, X5064edc14, X516c83687, X51c65dbbf, X51e6ff474, X52339abaa, X57ec7c064, X58527a4bd, X588b1527e, X5b39b7656, X5bb5613e6, X5c0989436, X5e1e6b5cd, X5f5c9f004, X60b772d45, X6135f999d, X633734a8d, X64d351829, X6a78f05ca, X6b5fde0d8, X6bfc76615, X6ece7fd18, X6f11d2d9a, X6f2b7cf2f, X734b5f63c, X745feaecc, X7506ab0a6, X75d7f8cfd, X7646588e5, X77f7a4f4e, X79e5b13fd, X7a23e0866, X7bb77d4ba, X7c7ff9c1b, X7defe336a, X7f6abb16c, X7f719739f, X7fdb76703, X809166e31, X81bcec60f, X83244a4ac, X83e284558, X892a3f9a4, X89cdd3a36, ...]",X0046dbb1d;X02f309050;X03b8af3fb;X04f497df4;X0b27e7870;X0be0ac600;X0d9e7a81b;X0dbbb0972;X0de023e00;X0f6d3c037;X11d3140b6;X1201f5345;X12897dcd5;X12e11ca02;X12eb007df;X13c1e56dc;X163f97354;X16573220e;X16c04d806;X183066d06;X192dc259b;X1c572b5b0;X1d18e9c76;X1dfd88a4e;X212cdcd84;X21c8a83bc;X2213b3eac;X22f2b24d2;X249ae746a;X2a0d27d9c;X2b02158ff;X2bf6c66bd;X2c214bec3;X2c6f6ea80;X2ecd43c0f;X2ff46de95;X31b09fca5;X32f47ff60;X33cfc84ea;X356043d86;X35f454fdf;X36b66ee6e;X379686384;X3900b54d1;X3ae2bcabc;X3f3668b82;X3fefb7be5;X41966bda2;X43769ee09;X448ded7d7;X44e5ee1da;X46042e4ea;X481627be6;X494b52966;X4aaadcf3f;X4ddcc2e34;X4e799405e;X5064edc14;X516c83687;X51c65dbbf;X51e6ff474;X52339abaa;X57ec7c064;X58527a4bd;X588b1527e;X5b39b7656;X5bb5613e6;X5c0989436;X5e1e6b5cd;X5f5c9f004;X60b772d45;X6135f999d;X633734a8d;X64d351829;X6a78f05ca;X6b5fde0d8;X6bfc76615;X6ece7fd18;X6f11d2d9a;X6f2b7cf2f;X734b5f63c;X745feaecc;X7506ab0a6;X75d7f8cfd;X7646588e5;X77f7a4f4e;X79e5b13fd;X7a23e0866;X7bb77d4ba;X7c7ff9c1b;X7defe336a;X7f6abb16c;X7f719739f;X7fdb76703;X809166e31;X81bcec60f;X83244a4ac;X83e284558;X892a3f9a4;X89cdd3a36;X8aff633e8;X8dd344b53;X9066d2145;X9095bedf6;X90a8bf8ff;X91079ba53;X93c7259b6;X93fcdd73d;X9405b0302;X95473d182;X955df5ab1;X9622d4ca9;X96d144ecf;X97810788a;X9801dad27;X98355f923;X9b88d0f45;X9d27e40b4;X9e11237cf;Xa13fd57c9;Xa288a272b;Xa3f44ede4;Xa860339de;Xb2570db62;Xb369a7108;Xb393fe971;Xb7f060bf3;Xb7f54f04e;Xb8e1e9533;Xb96c779aa;Xbb65da714;Xbe93ea727;Xbfbcf78a8;Xc3c1be430;Xc54a1c219;Xc8b21a105;Xcb2654a13;Xcc86b0d8b;Xcc8fa8edb;Xcdccf9382;Xcdd851bc1;Xcdf87fc0a;Xcff723c47;Xd04744858;Xd06403891;Xd115e2082;Xd195dc62f;Xd233e7821;Xd248f810d;Xd2b6b6f38;Xd46daccfb;Xd7c5afff9;Xd9c79ee55;Xd9ee944b5;Xddfcaeee7;Xdf2a4fad3;Xdf2ef2198;Xdff0aa9c7;Xe35793bc6;Xe394dabcb;Xe4b8759e0;Xe5cb1802a;Xe8eb89489;Xea26f5f8d;Xeb9f54783;Xec5107dcd;Xec728acbe;Xee4e89dc5;Xef7d75bcf;Xefb96a100;Xf1de8b9f1;Xf24a1938c;Xf510e128b;Xf6135a1e6;Xf864becea;Xfc5715582;Xfc61578f7;Xfe7f1cac3,178,The Role of Computer Graphics in Documentary Film Production,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0663,2011
428,"We present a novel method of simulating wave effects in graphics using ray--based renderers with a new function: the Wave BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function). Reflections from neighboring surface patches represented by local BSDFs are mutually independent. However, in many surfaces with wavelength-scale microstructures, interference and diffraction requires a joint analysis of reflected wavefronts from neighboring patches. We demonstrate a simple method to compute the BSDF for the entire microstructure, which can be used independently for each patch. This allows us to use traditional ray--based rendering pipelines to synthesize wave effects of light and sound. We exploit the Wigner Distribution Function (WDF) to create transmissive, reflective, and emissive BSDFs for various diffraction phenomena in a physically accurate way. In contrast to previous methods for computing interference, we circumvent the need to explicitly keep track of the phase of the wave by using BSDFs that include positive as well as negative coefficients. We describe and compare the theory in relation to well understood concepts in rendering and demonstrate a straightforward implementation. In conjunction with standard raytracers, such as PBRT, we demonstrate wave effects for a range of scenarios such as multi--bounce diffraction materials, holograms and reflection of high frequency surfaces.","Cuypers, Tom;Oh, Se Baek;Haber, Tom;Bekaert, Philippe;Raskar, Ramesh",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0b7829378, X17a5d9595, X1d90e9973, X25002ddd1, X3177c84fa, X34255c295, X355030016, X400f76d42, X414cc6a88, X46913d350, X47a8c9ce1, X4d39330bb, X53d40588e, X591220e51, X5fbeac283, X6099a8d4d, X65879cf09, X6e36215f2, X717e2b595, X74c5e9f77, X758cc5d96, X7b94acf93, X7c630c583, X7cb4042c5, X84e4e4170, X8ece71ed3, X928daeea3, X951fc3c8d, X95a9e7146, X98e335caa, Xa56b62951, Xaf84c004e, Xb6d72eba2, Xba7a2c020, Xbf4a0e625, Xc01c31751, Xcf2e3a3b4, Xcf6b2361a, Xd67a30a97, Xf305b04a0, Xf50027e62, Xf71e12853, Xfb945d159]",X0b7829378;X17a5d9595;X1d90e9973;X25002ddd1;X3177c84fa;X34255c295;X355030016;X400f76d42;X414cc6a88;X46913d350;X47a8c9ce1;X4d39330bb;X53d40588e;X591220e51;X5fbeac283;X6099a8d4d;X65879cf09;X6e36215f2;X717e2b595;X74c5e9f77;X758cc5d96;X7b94acf93;X7c630c583;X7cb4042c5;X84e4e4170;X8ece71ed3;X928daeea3;X951fc3c8d;X95a9e7146;X98e335caa;Xa56b62951;Xaf84c004e;Xb6d72eba2;Xba7a2c020;Xbf4a0e625;Xc01c31751;Xcf2e3a3b4;Xcf6b2361a;Xd67a30a97;Xf305b04a0;Xf50027e62;Xf71e12853;Xfb945d159,43,Ray-Based Reflectance Model for Diffraction,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5490,2011
429,"In computer graphics, smooth data reconstruction on 2D or 3D manifolds usually refers to subdivision problems. Such a method is only valid based on dense sample points. The manifold usually needs to be triangulated into meshes (or patches) and each node on the mesh will have an initial value. While the mesh is refined the algorithm will provide a smooth function on the redefined manifolds. However, when data points are not dense and the original mesh is not allowed to be changed, how is the ""continuous and/or smooth"" reconstruction possible? This paper will present a new method using harmonic functions to solve the problem. Our method contains the following steps: (1) Partition the boundary surfaces of the 3D manifold based on sample points so that each sample point is on the edge of the partition. (2) Use gradually varied interpolation on the edges so that each point on edge will be assigned a value. In addition, all values on the edge are gradually varied. (3) Use discrete harmonic function to fit the unknown points, i.e. the points inside each partition patch. The fitted function will be a harmonic or a local harmonic function in each partitioned area. The function on edge will be ""near"" continuous (or ""near"" gradually varied). If we need a smoothed surface on the manifold, we can apply subdivision algorithms. This paper has also a philosophical advantage over triangulation meshes. People usually use triangulation for data reconstruction. This paper employs harmonic functions, a generalization of triangulation because linearity is a form of harmonic. Therefore, local harmonic initialization is more sophisticated then triangulation. This paper is a conceptual and methodological paper. This paper does not focus on detailed mathematical analysis nor fine algorithm design.","Chen, Li;Luo, Feng",ArXiv e-prints,"[X92812cd4c, X9704344a8, Xb65221ac8, Xf0c24f1b2, Xf76d8f905]",X92812cd4c;X9704344a8;Xb65221ac8;Xf0c24f1b2;Xf76d8f905,5,Harmonic Functions for Data Reconstruction on 3D Manifolds,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0200,2011
430,"The context of this paper is the use of formal methods for topology-based geometric modelling. Topology-based geometric modelling deals with objects of various dimensions and shapes. Usually, objects are defined by a graph-based topological data structure and by an embedding that associates each topological element (vertex, edge, face, etc.) with relevant data as their geometric shape (position, curve, surface, etc.) or application dedicated data (e.g. molecule concentration level in a biological context). We propose to define topology-based geometric objects as labelled graphs. The arc labelling defines the topological structure of the object whose topological consistency is then ensured by labelling constraints. Nodes have as many labels as there are different data kinds in the embedding. Labelling constraints ensure then that the embedding is consistent with the topological structure. Thus, topology-based geometric objects constitute a particular subclass of a category of labelled graphs in which nodes have multiple labels.","Bellet, Thomas;Arnould, Agnès;Le Gall, Pascale",ArXiv e-prints,"[X11e3d651d, X146a96122, X43c766f5c, X57360c633, X579c44ba2, Xc500db453, Xd7422ecdb, Xf0f746953]",X11e3d651d;X146a96122;X43c766f5c;X57360c633;X579c44ba2;Xc500db453;Xd7422ecdb;Xf0f746953,8,Rule-based transformations for geometric modelling,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2652,2011

432,"We present the first polynomial time approximation algorithm for computing shortest paths in weighted three-dimensional domains. Given a polyhedral domain $\D$, consisting of $n$ tetrahedra with positive weights, and a real number $\eps\in(0,1)$, our algorithm constructs paths in $\D$ from a fixed source vertex to all vertices of $\D$, whose costs are at most $1+\eps$ times the costs of (weighted) shortest paths, in $O(\C(\D)\frac{n}{\eps^{2.5}}\log\frac{n}{\eps}\log^3\frac{1}{\eps})$ time, where $\C(\D)$ is a geometric parameter related to the aspect ratios of tetrahedra. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is based on an in-depth study of the local behavior of geodesic paths and additive Voronoi diagrams in weighted three-dimensional domains, which are of independent interest.

Such conditions include low lighting, haze, and high dynamic range situations. The algorithm automatically detects the dominate source of impairment, then depending on whether it is low lighting, haze or others, a corresponding pre-processing is applied to the input video, followed by the core enhancement algorithm. Temporal and spatial redundancies in the video input are utilized to facilitate real-time processing and to improve temporal and spatial consistency of the output.

434,"With more and more digital media, especially in the field of virtual reality where detailed and convincing scenes are much required, procedural scene generation is a big helping tool for artists. A problem is that defining scene descriptions through these procedures usually requires a knowledge in formal language grammars, programming theory and manually editing textual files using a strict syntax, making it less intuitive to use. Luckily, graphical user interfaces has made a lot of tasks on computers easier to perform and out of the belief that creating computer programs can also be one of them, visual programming languages (VPLs) have emerged. The goal in VPLs is to shift more work from the programmer to the integrated development environment (IDE), making programming an user-friendlier task. In this thesis, an approach of using a VPL for defining procedures that automatically generate virtual scenes is presented. The methods required to build a VPL are presented, including a novel method of generating readable code in a structured programming language. Also, the methods for achieving basic principles of VPLs will be shown -- suitable visual presentation of information and guiding the programmer in the right direction using constraints. On the other hand, procedural generation methods are presented in the context of visual programming -- adapting the application programming interface (API) of these methods to better serve the user. The main focus will be on the methods for urban modeling, such as building, city layout and details generation with random number generation used to create non-deterministic scenes.","Lucanin, Drazen",ArXiv e-prints,"[X02b5cc52e, X13e517ab0, X23087ed22, X5cf5820ec, X9ff56aaba, Xa1c687ef0, Xa9c7e8a6d, Xf03800c29, Xf22f567a5]",X02b5cc52e;X13e517ab0;X23087ed22;X5cf5820ec;X9ff56aaba;Xa1c687ef0;Xa9c7e8a6d;Xf03800c29;Xf22f567a5,9,Visual definition of procedures for automatic virtual scene generation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2868,2012

We identify the two most active fields for progress - visualization of large-N particle data and spectral data cubes - discuss open areas of research, and introduce a mapping between astronomical sources of data and data representations used in general-purpose visualization tools. We discuss contributions using high-performance computing architectures (e.g. distributed processing and GPUs), collaborative astronomy visualization, the use of workflow systems to store metadata about visualization parameters, and the use of advanced interaction devices.

438,"Compared with full volume rendering, isosurface rendering has several well recognized advantages in efficiency and accuracy. However, standard isosurface rendering has some limitations in effectiveness. First, it uses a monotone colored approach and can only visualize the geometry features of an isosurface. The lack of the capability to illustrate the material property and the internal structures behind an isosurface has been a big limitation of this method in applications. Another limitation of isosurface rendering is the difficulty to reveal physically meaningful structures, which are hidden in one or multiple isosurfaces. As such, the application requirements of extract and recombine structures of interest can not be implemented effectively with isosurface rendering. In this work, we develop an enhanced isosurface rendering technique to improve the effectiveness while maintaining the performance efficiency of the standard isosurface rendering. First, an isosurface color enhancement method is proposed to illustrate the neighborhood density and to reveal some of the internal structures. Second, we extend the structure extraction capability of isosurface rendering by enabling explicit scene exploration within a 3D-view, using surface peeling, voxel-selecting, isosurface segmentation, and multi-surface-structure visualization. Our experiments show that the color enhancement not only improves the visual fidelity of the rendering, but also reveals the internal structures without significant increase of the computational cost. Explicit scene exploration is also demonstrated as a powerful tool in some application scenarios, such as displaying multiple abdominal organs.","Yang, Fei;Cao, Yong;Tian, Jie",ArXiv e-prints,"[X384738892, X6ab721d77, Xa3b932de4, Xf907fe6ea]",X384738892;X6ab721d77;Xa3b932de4;Xf907fe6ea,4,Efficient and Effective Volume Visualization with Enhanced Isosurface Rendering,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5360,2012

441,"Many entities managed by HEP Software Frameworks represent spatial (3-dimensional) real objects. Effective definition, manipulation and visualization of such objects is an indispensable functionality. GraXML is a modular Geometric Modeling toolkit capable of processing geometric data of various kinds (detector geometry, event geometry) from different sources and delivering them in ways suitable for further use. Geometric data are first modeled in one of the Generic Models. Those Models are then used to populate powerful Geometric Model based on the Java3D technology. While Java3D has been originally created just to provide visualization of 3D objects, its light weight and high functionality allow an effective reuse as a general geometric component. This is possible also thanks to a large overlap between graphical and general geometric functionality and modular design of Java3D itself. Its graphical functionalities also allow a natural visualization of all manipulated elements. All these techniques have been developed primarily (or only) for the Java environment. It is, however, possible to interface them transparently to Frameworks built in other languages, like for example C++.

Their performance is on par with previously presented GPU implementations of noise, they are very convenient to use, and they scale well with increasing parallelism in present and upcoming GPU architectures.","McEwan, Ian;Sheets, David;Gustavson, Stefan;Richardson, Mark",ArXiv e-prints,"[X043b7f294, X054317301, X072a494d7, X0bd40467c, X0c81d62cc, X0d956cc07, X0f0650e47, X22783a893, X250d33bbe, X30f6db607, X383a7c153, X3f58520e8, X41ee14375, X522b22a98, X53378ce6d, X53dba3063, X54ed6a3e9, X555406444, X565ac7c28, X640c03917, X6dc9f8f1d, X6ded74ec4, X7584a1cba, X796e9c142, X7ee6ddc9e, X80f12df48, X89e4c8aab, X8d9677b6d, X8dde80f0c, X95e2acf6a, Xa23988d7e, Xa7863bb36, Xae4b454af, Xb0a432348, Xb4e92dbf7, Xc500db453, Xc7a7a7f45, Xca31c8b51, Xd8d93565c, Xd9aad9557, Xdfd4fce0b, Xe68231738, Xf1bbe056a, Xf8e13d914]",X043b7f294;X054317301;X072a494d7;X0bd40467c;X0c81d62cc;X0d956cc07;X0f0650e47;X22783a893;X250d33bbe;X30f6db607;X383a7c153;X3f58520e8;X41ee14375;X522b22a98;X53378ce6d;X53dba3063;X54ed6a3e9;X555406444;X565ac7c28;X640c03917;X6dc9f8f1d;X6ded74ec4;X7584a1cba;X796e9c142;X7ee6ddc9e;X80f12df48;X89e4c8aab;X8d9677b6d;X8dde80f0c;X95e2acf6a;Xa23988d7e;Xa7863bb36;Xae4b454af;Xb0a432348;Xb4e92dbf7;Xc500db453;Xc7a7a7f45;Xca31c8b51;Xd8d93565c;Xd9aad9557;Xdfd4fce0b;Xe68231738;Xf1bbe056a;Xf8e13d914,44,Efficient computational noise in GLSL,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1461,2012
443,"Image resampling is a necessary component of any operation that changes the size of an image or its geometry. Methods tuned for natural image upsampling (roughly speaking, image enlargement) are analyzed and developed with a focus on their ability to preserve diagonal features and suppress overshoots. Monotone, locally bounded and almost monotone ""direct"" interpolation and filtering methods, as well as face split and vertex split surface subdivision methods, alone or in combination, are studied. Key properties are established by way of proofs and counterexamples as well as numerical experiments involving 1D curve and 2D diagonal data resampling. In addition, the Remez minimax method for the computation of low-cost polynomial approximations of low-pass filter kernels tuned for natural image downsampling (roughly speaking, image reduction) is refactored for relative error minimization in the presence of roots in the interior of the interval of approximation and so that even and odd functions are approximated with like polynomials. The accuracy and frequency response of the approximations are tabulated and plotted against the original, establishing their rapid convergence.","Racette, Chantal",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0e53090a3, X107054ac2, X1a96d23d4, X2a4d32e79, X375d8069d, X4d78717b2, X560adde2d, X996cd0a3c, Xb5485c2fd, Xc5ea389be, Xc62603c26, Xc7c2ba706]",X0e53090a3;X107054ac2;X1a96d23d4;X2a4d32e79;X375d8069d;X4d78717b2;X560adde2d;X996cd0a3c;Xb5485c2fd;Xc5ea389be;Xc62603c26;Xc7c2ba706,12,"Numerical Analysis of Diagonal-Preserving, Ripple-Minimizing and Low-Pass Image Resampling Methods",http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4734,2012
444,"We introduce the heat method for computing the shortest geodesic distance to a specified subset (e.g., point or curve) of a given domain. The heat method is robust, efficient, and simple to implement since it is based on solving a pair of standard linear elliptic problems. The method represents a significant breakthrough in the practical computation of distance on a wide variety of geometric domains, since the resulting linear systems can be prefactored once and subsequently solved in near-linear time. In practice, distance can be updated via the heat method an order of magnitude faster than with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy. We provide numerical evidence that the method converges to the exact geodesic distance in the limit of refinement; we also explore smoothed approximations of distance suitable for applications where more regularity is required.","Crane, Keenan;Weischedel, Clarisse;Wardetzky, Max",ArXiv e-prints,"[5427bf0ce8, X02e87543a, X07754bbf8, X0a11d0e63, X0ce8d6a5d, X0f0accac0, X2261645b5, X2286bc0a3, X2654607cf, X270ec68e4, X2a4cd2b6c, X319158152, X3769f7bf0, X37b2eb6f3, X3e2d54b82, X4286ff516, X47d271195, X500d66b73, X5201e6002, X56853d76d, X571bf46ee, X57a8cee7c, X62623355f, X65a7e0b26, X69b0cf295, X6c5f6903d, X6e72d1186, X738f860d4, X7b35ac259, X7c0fe2793, X7f748f246, X83624bf97, X86d104f65, X8b1aa0b95, X8cbfca762, X8d0a10ab1, X9d94ad4eb, Xa428ca9a9, Xa5e9c851e, Xad15b3251, Xb00c25219, Xbe9b2bded, Xbf6197462, Xc6c74df8c, Xcc3743f04, Xd23987b51, Xe4df5152c, Xe7eeb4c7c, Xef183bc9c, Xf9d5cc137, Xfa0e9efce]",5427bf0ce8;X02e87543a;X07754bbf8;X0a11d0e63;X0ce8d6a5d;X0f0accac0;X2261645b5;X2286bc0a3;X2654607cf;X270ec68e4;X2a4cd2b6c;X319158152;X3769f7bf0;X37b2eb6f3;X3e2d54b82;X4286ff516;X47d271195;X500d66b73;X5201e6002;X56853d76d;X571bf46ee;X57a8cee7c;X62623355f;X65a7e0b26;X69b0cf295;X6c5f6903d;X6e72d1186;X738f860d4;X7b35ac259;X7c0fe2793;X7f748f246;X83624bf97;X86d104f65;X8b1aa0b95;X8cbfca762;X8d0a10ab1;X9d94ad4eb;Xa428ca9a9;Xa5e9c851e;Xad15b3251;Xb00c25219;Xbe9b2bded;Xbf6197462;Xc6c74df8c;Xcc3743f04;Xd23987b51;Xe4df5152c;Xe7eeb4c7c;Xef183bc9c;Xf9d5cc137;Xfa0e9efce,51,Geodesics in Heat,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6216,2012
445,"This thesis presents a two-layer uniform facet elastic object for real-time simulation based on physics modeling method. It describes the elastic object procedural modeling algorithm with particle system from the simplest one-dimensional object, to more complex two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects. The double-layered elastic object consists of inner and outer elastic mass spring surfaces and compressible internal pressure. The density of the inner layer can be set different from the density of the outer layer; the motion of the inner layer can be opposite to the motion of the outer layer. These special features, which cannot be achieved by a single layered object, result in improved imitation of a soft body, such as tissue's liquidity non-uniform deformation. The construction of the double-layered elastic object is closer to the real tissue's physical structure. The inertial behavior of the elastic object is well illustrated in environments with gravity and collisions with walls, ceiling, and floor. The collision detection is defined by elastic collision penalty method and the motion of the object is guided by the Ordinary Differential Equation computation. Users can interact with the modeled objects, deform them, and observe the response to their action in real time.","Song, Miao",ArXiv e-prints,"[X282cb5043, X33db9cbf2, X362595914, X3ccfa890d, X8b2e09cad, X9df1519b6, Xd1be4c757, Xdab998d42, Xef24c15af, Xfc3e8b1dc]",X282cb5043;X33db9cbf2;X362595914;X3ccfa890d;X8b2e09cad;X9df1519b6;Xd1be4c757;Xdab998d42;Xef24c15af;Xfc3e8b1dc,10,Dynamic Deformation of Uniform Elastic Two-Layer Objects,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4364,2009

The main design target for this framework is to provide an in-core visualization solution able to provide three-dimensional interactive views of terabyte-sized data cubes. We tested the presented framework using a computing cluster comprising 64 nodes with a total of 128GPUs. The framework proved to be scalable to render a 204GB data cube with an average of 30 frames per second. Our performance analyses also compare the use of NVIDIA Tesla 1060 and 2050GPU architectures and the effect of increasing the visualization output resolution on the rendering performance. Although our initial focus, as shown in the examples presented in this work, is volume rendering of spectral data cubes from radio astronomy, we contend that our approach has applicability to other disciplines where close to real-time volume rendering of terabyte-order three-dimensional data sets is a requirement.","Hassan, A.

447,"Fractal image compression is attractive except for its high encoding time requirements. The image is encoded as a set of contractive affine transformations. The image is partitioned into non-overlapping range blocks, and a best matching domain block larger than the range block is identified. There are many attempts on improving the encoding time by reducing the size of search pool for range-domain matching. But these methods are attempting to prepare a static domain pool that remains unchanged throughout the encoding process. This paper proposes dynamic preparation of separate domain pool for each range block. This will result in significant reduction in the encoding time. The domain pool for a particular range block can be selected based upon a parametric value. Here we use classification based on local fractal dimension.","Revathy, K.;Jayamohan, M.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X01c5c43d3, X5b9825576, Xccc8cd49c]",X01c5c43d3;X5b9825576;Xccc8cd49c,3,Dynamic Domain Classification for Fractal Image Compression,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4880,2012

449,"Flow fields are often represented by a set of static arrows to illustrate scientific vulgarization, documentary film, meteorology, etc. This simple schematic representation lets an observer intuitively interpret the main properties of a flow: its orientation and velocity magnitude. We propose to generate dynamic versions of such representations for 2D unsteady flow fields. Our algorithm smoothly animates arrows along the flow while controlling their density in the domain over time. Several strategies have been combined to lower the unavoidable popping artifacts arising when arrows appear and disappear and to achieve visually pleasing animations. Disturbing arrow rotations in low velocity regions are also handled by continuously morphing arrow glyphs to semi-transparent discs. To substantiate our method, we provide results for synthetic and real velocity field datasets.","Jobard, Bruno;Ray, Nicolas;Sokolov, Dmitry",ArXiv e-prints,"[4f3cdd6355, X1d454ae6d, X28afecd84, X382cc9129, X3cddb6101, X61013258b, X7533016ec, X93ed29ce6, Xcd69d87a6, Xd30d902a7, Xd47d81d35, Xd4b47b531]",4f3cdd6355;X1d454ae6d;X28afecd84;X382cc9129;X3cddb6101;X61013258b;X7533016ec;X93ed29ce6;Xcd69d87a6;Xd30d902a7;Xd47d81d35;Xd4b47b531,12,Visualizing 2D Flows with Animated Arrow Plots,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5204,2012

454,Color intensity projections (CIPs) have been shown to improve the visualisation of greyscale angiography images by combining greyscale images into a single color image. A key property of the combined CIPs image is the encoding of the arrival time information from greyscale images into the hue of the color in the CIPs image. A few minor improvements to the calculation of the CIPs image are introduced that substantially improve the quality of the visualisation. One improvement is interpolating of the greyscale images in time before calculation of the CIPs image. A second is the use of hue cycling - where the hue of the color is cycled through more than once in an image. The hue cycling allows the variation of the hue to be concentrated in structures of interest. An angiogram of a brain is used to demonstrate the substantial improvements hue cycling brings to CIPs images. A third improvement is the use of maximum intensity projection for 2D rendering of a 3D CIPs image volume.

455,"Oriental ink painting, called Sumi-e, is one of the most appealing painting styles that has attracted artists around the world. Major challenges in computer-based Sumi-e simulation are to abstract complex scene information and draw smooth and natural brush strokes. To automatically find such strokes, we propose to model the brush as a reinforcement learning agent, and learn desired brush-trajectories by maximizing the sum of rewards in the policy search framework. We also provide elaborate design of actions, states, and rewards tailored for a Sumi-e agent. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated through simulated Sumi-e experiments.","Xie, Ning;Hachiya, Hirotaka;Sugiyama, Masashi",IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems,"[X0ca1df130, X11e5cbd5f, X15efaf7cc, X166b68eb2, X1d524ee7e, X211f42e84, X308588523, X3ca6868c3, X3d3e225b4, X4d4091e29, X4ffdb9d11, X5b6ef911f, X5dba15b1d, X698f70d58, X6d01ac0f1, X71061b0cb, X720ac20a1, X77d81f7b4, X83cf75cce, X872efa378, X8b402a927, X8c4d51295, X9060c02d0, Xa1d7b19e8, Xa8ca76723, Xb3a2096e4, Xd1cd0d03a, Xd5e0aa6e3, Xdb653aeb4, Xe5518ec13, Xf6df53274, Xf8d7a2d89, Xfddbed8c2]",X0ca1df130;X11e5cbd5f;X15efaf7cc;X166b68eb2;X1d524ee7e;X211f42e84;X308588523;X3ca6868c3;X3d3e225b4;X4d4091e29;X4ffdb9d11;X5b6ef911f;X5dba15b1d;X698f70d58;X6d01ac0f1;X71061b0cb;X720ac20a1;X77d81f7b4;X83cf75cce;X872efa378;X8b402a927;X8c4d51295;X9060c02d0;Xa1d7b19e8;Xa8ca76723;Xb3a2096e4;Xd1cd0d03a;Xd5e0aa6e3;Xdb653aeb4;Xe5518ec13;Xf6df53274;Xf8d7a2d89;Xfddbed8c2,33,Artist Agent: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Automatic Stroke Generation in Oriental Ink Painting,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4634,2013

Much of the work with such data focuses on filtering: predicting unknown ratings for pairs of users and items. In this paper we focus on the problem of visualizing the information. Given all of the ratings, our task is to embed all of the users and items as points in the same Euclidean space. We would like to place users near items that they have rated (or would rate) high, and far away from those they would give a low rating. We pose this problem as a real-valued non-linear Bayesian network and employ Markov chain Monte Carlo and expectation maximization to find an embedding.

459,"Given the ever increasing bandwidth of the visual information available to many intelligent systems, it is becoming essential to endow them with a sense of what is worthwhile their attention and what can be safely disregarded. This article presents a general mathematical framework to efficiently allocate the available computational resources to process the parts of the input that are relevant to solve a given perceptual problem. By this we mean to find the hypothesis H (i.e., the state of the world) that maximizes a function L(H), representing how well each hypothesis ""explains"" the input. Given the large bandwidth of the sensory input, fully evaluating L(H) for each hypothesis H is computationally infeasible (e.g., because it would imply checking a large number of pixels). To address this problem we propose a mathematical framework with two key ingredients. The first one is a Bounding Mechanism (BM) to compute lower and upper bounds of L(H), for a given computational budget. These bounds are much cheaper to compute than L(H) itself, can be refined at any time by increasing the budget allocated to a hypothesis, and are frequently enough to discard a hypothesis. To compute these bounds, we develop a novel theory of shapes and shape priors. The second ingredient is a Focus of Attention Mechanism (FoAM) to select which hypothesis' bounds should be refined next, with the goal of discarding non-optimal hypotheses with the least amount of computation. The proposed framework: 1) is very efficient since most hypotheses are discarded with minimal computation; 2) is parallelizable; 3) is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis; and 4) its running time depends on the problem at hand, not on the bandwidth of the input. We instantiate the proposed framework for the problem of simultaneously estimating the class, pose, and a noiseless version of a 2D shape in a 2D image.","Rother, Diego;Schütz, Simon;Vidal, René",ArXiv e-prints,"[X59b5390b9, Xa67d34a8a, Xbd5c90e94, Xbd8f200d0, Xfad158c7f]",X59b5390b9;Xa67d34a8a;Xbd5c90e94;Xbd8f200d0;Xfad158c7f,5,"Hypothesize and Bound: A Computational Focus of Attention Mechanism for Simultaneous N-D Segmentation, Pose Estimation and Classification Using Shape Priors",http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2580,2011
460,"A new generalized Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) was proposed by Rosso et al in 2010. It is a functional that captures the notions of order/disorder and of distance to an equilibrium distribution. The former is computed by a measure of entropy, while the latter depends on the definition of a stochastic divergence. When the scene is illuminated by coherent radiation, image data is corrupted by speckle noise, as is the case of ultrasound-B, sonar, laser and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In the amplitude and intensity formats, this noise is multiplicative and non-Gaussian requiring, thus, specialized techniques for image processing and understanding. One of the most successful family of models for describing these images is the Multiplicative Model which leads, among other probability distributions, to the G0 law. This distribution has been validated in the literature as an expressive and tractable model, deserving the ""universal"" denomination for its ability to describe most types of targets. In order to compute the statistical complexity of a site in an image corrupted by speckle noise, we assume that the equilibrium distribution is that of fully developed speckle, namely the Gamma law in intensity format, which appears in areas with little or no texture. We use the Shannon entropy along with the Hellinger distance to measure the statistical complexity of intensity SAR images, and we show that it is an expressive feature capable of identifying many types of targets.","de Almeida, Eliana S.;de Medeiros, Antonio Carlos;Rosso, Osvaldo A.;Frery, Alejandro C.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X478223918, X55235a0aa, X8f36f18d2, X92477adf8, X973b1bcfd, Xa8a05b490, Xcf5ef543f, Xd55394134, Xd994b224a, Xdb5f45caf, Xe3c5929d1]",X478223918;X55235a0aa;X8f36f18d2;X92477adf8;X973b1bcfd;Xa8a05b490;Xcf5ef543f;Xd55394134;Xd994b224a;Xdb5f45caf;Xe3c5929d1,11,Generalized Statistical Complexity of SAR Imagery,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0757,2012

A window is defined around each pixel, samples are compared and only those which pass a goodness-of-fit test are used to compute the filtered value. The technique is applied to intensity Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, using the Gamma model with varying number of looks allowing, thus, changes in heterogeneity. Modified Nagao-Matsuyama windows are used to define the samples. The proposal is compared with the Lee's filter which is considered a standard, using a protocol based on simulation. Among the criteria used to quantify the quality of filters, we employ the equivalent number of looks (related to the signal-to-noise ratio), line contrast, and edge preservation. Moreover, we also assessed the filters by the Universal Image Quality Index and the Pearson's correlation between edges.","Torres, Leonardo;Cavalcante, Tamer;Frery, Alejandro C.",ArXiv e-prints,"[X1cdbcc157, X5190786be, Xce1f0fbe5]",X1cdbcc157;X5190786be;Xce1f0fbe5,3,Speckle Reduction using Stochastic Distances,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0704,2012

The most complete format this type of imaging produces consists of complex-valued Hermitian matrices in every image coordinate and, as such, their visualization is challenging. They also suffer from speckle noise which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio. Smoothing techniques have been proposed in the literature aiming at preserving different features and, analogously, projections from the cone of Hermitian positive matrices to different color representation spaces are used for enhancing certain characteristics. In this work we propose the use of stochastic distances between models that describe this type of data in a Nagao-Matsuyama-type of smoothing technique. The resulting images are shown to present good visualization properties (noise reduction with preservation of fine details) in all the considered visualization spaces.","Torres, Leonardo;Medeiros, Antonio C.;Frery, Alejandro C.",ArXiv e-prints,"[Xcc3d9d5b3, Xd85735557, Xfad301481]",Xcc3d9d5b3;Xd85735557;Xfad301481,3,Polarimetric SAR Image Smoothing with Stochastic Distances,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0771,2012
463,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has a pivotal role as a remote imaging method. Obtained by means of coherent illumination, SAR images are contaminated with speckle noise. The statistical modeling of such contamination is well described according with the multiplicative model and its implied G0 distribution. The understanding of SAR imagery and scene element identification is an important objective in the field. In particular, reliable image contrast tools are sought. Aiming the proposition of new tools for evaluating SAR image contrast, we investigated new methods based on stochastic divergence. We propose several divergence measures specifically tailored for G0 distributed data. We also introduce a nonparametric approach based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance for G0 data. We devised and assessed tests based on such measures, and their performances were quantified according to their test sizes and powers. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we present a robustness analysis of test statistics and of maximum likelihood estimators for several degrees of innovative contamination.

464,"Images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of sonar, ultrasound-B, laser and Synthetic Aperture Radar -- SAR, are affected by speckle noise which reduces the ability to extract information from the data. Specialized techniques are required to deal with such imagery, which has been modeled by the G0 distribution and under which regions with different degrees of roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a third parameter, the number of looks, is related to the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image analysis; they provide grounds of the separability and, therefore, of the performance of classification procedures. This work derives and compares eight stochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that employ them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on the triangular distance have the closest empirical size to the theoretical one, while those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power. Since the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum, we conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis testing, even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and Bhattacharyya.","Nascimento, Abraão D.

The system can be operated either in Speech mode or in Gesture mode. The system can be controlled by various audio commands if user opts for Speech mode. The same controlling can also be done by using a set of Gestures in Gesture mode. Gesture recognition is the task performed by Kinect system.

466,"In this paper we introduce the combined use of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and Haptic interfaces. We propose to adapt haptic guides based on the mental activity measured by a BCI system. This novel approach is illustrated within a proof-of-concept system: haptic guides are toggled during a path-following task thanks to a mental workload index provided by a BCI. The aim of this system is to provide haptic assistance only when the user's brain activity reflects a high mental workload. A user study conducted with 8 participants shows that our proof-of-concept is operational and exploitable. Results show that activation of haptic guides occurs in the most difficult part of the path-following task. Moreover it allows to increase task performance by 53% by activating assistance only 59% of the time. Taken together, these results suggest that BCI could be used to determine when the user needs assistance during haptic interaction and to enable haptic guides accordingly.","George, Laurent;Marchal, Maud;Glondu, Loeïz;Lécuyer, Anatole",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0a49e1bd9, X0ad2623ee, X196c6271c, X52a65c681, X57b2ed79b, X6235fae48, X8704c6cdb, Xadc9f66f2, Xb5542b095]",X0a49e1bd9;X0ad2623ee;X196c6271c;X52a65c681;X57b2ed79b;X6235fae48;X8704c6cdb;Xadc9f66f2;Xb5542b095,9,Combining Brain-Computer Interfaces and Haptics: Detecting Mental Workload to Adapt Haptic Assistance,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3351,2012
467,"Researchers got success in mining the Web usage data effectively and efficiently. But representation of the mined patterns is often not in a form suitable for direct human consumption. Hence mechanisms and tools that can represent mined patterns in easily understandable format are utilized. Different techniques are used for pattern analysis, one of them is visualization. Visualization can provide valuable assistance for data analysis and decision making tasks. In the data visualization process, technical representations of web pages are replaced by user attractive text interpretations. Experiments with the real world problems showed that the visualization can significantly increase the quality and usefulness of web log mining results. However, how decision makers perceive and interact with a visual representation can strongly influence their understanding of the data as well as the usefulness of the visual presentation. Human factors therefore contribute significantly to the visualization process and should play an important role in the design and evaluation of visualization tools.

This device can capture highly detailed facial geometry (down to the level of skin pores detail) and Multispectral reflectance map which can be used to estimate biophysical skin parameters such as the distribution of pigmentation and blood beneath the surface of the skin. We extend the analysis of the original spherical gradient photometric stereo method to study the effects of deformed diffuse lobes on the quality of recovered surface normals. Based on our modified radiance equations, we develop a minimal image set method to recover high quality photometric normals using only four, instead of six, spherical gradient images. Using the same radiance equations, we explore a Quadratic Programming (QP) based algorithm for correction of surface normals obtained using spherical gradient photometric stereo. Based on the proposed minimal image sets method, we present a performance capture sequence that significantly reduces the data capture requirement and post-processing computational cost of existing photometric stereo based performance geometry capture methods. Furthermore, we explore the use of images captured in our Light Stage to generate stimuli images for a psychology experiment exploring the neural representation of 3D shape and texture of a human face.","Dutta, Abhishek",ArXiv e-prints,"[X50614e98d, Xf0f42c5a8]",X50614e98d;Xf0f42c5a8,2,Face Shape and Reflectance Acquisition using a Multispectral Light Stage,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3617,2011

472,"In this paper, we introduce two generalizations of midpoint subdivision and analyze the smoothness of the resulting subdivision surfaces at regular and extraordinary points. The smoothing operators used in midpoint and mid-edge subdivision connect the midpoints of adjacent faces or of adjacent edges, respectively. An arbitrary combination of these two operators and the refinement operator that splits each face with m vertices into m quadrilateral subfaces forms a general midpoint subdivision operator. We analyze the smoothness of the resulting subdivision surfaces by estimating the norm of a special second order difference scheme and by using established methods for analyzing midpoint subdivision. The surfaces are smooth at their regular points and they are also smooth at extraordinary points for a certain subclass of general midpoint subdivision schemes. Generalizing the smoothing rules of non general midpoint subdivision schemes around extraordinary and regular vertices or faces results in a class of subdivision schemes, which includes the Catmull-Clark algorithm with restricted parameters. We call these subdivision schemes generalized Catmull-Clark schemes and we analyze their smoothness properties.","Chen, Qi;Prautzsch, Hartmut",ArXiv e-prints,"[X031b39290, X0b9edfac8, X10a71e5f0, X113280263, X127be1bea, X1400957eb, X163855b07, X180d01cf1, X1b63f81f1, X26f4e57ad, X289a6e913, X388224345, X3be9395bc, X3e6c685e0, X4095ceed5, X409a29c24, X425303e8b, X44606998c, X48ac4891d, X4e63c2f47, X4ec38c2fd, X51225899c, X53333991d, X5f80f8f5b, X650a079bc, X74e31ac5e, X75631bb15, X7717cfadc, X77b255fc9, X7950021ff, X7c5771a14, X83c3496a8, X8567efd8d, X874721b98, X8e52016c6, X8ebbff9db, X93a9d1a87, X93ac8e929, X97615da3a, X991cb40ea, X99693601d, X9c7ce4c63, X9fc819d26, Xa4d954210, Xa87b1f7fa, Xad7b387f0, Xb19d0d7ea, Xb3381e12c, Xb4b3d4707, Xb58801275, Xbbafc83f2, Xc11aba694, Xc4111f21c, Xc4442bf46, Xc6fa766f6, Xce307591a, Xd09d2c6d3, Xd1bde92fc, Xd40a29f99, Xd42e8aed5, Xd4c82ea6a, Xd6db25654, Xd85656f33, Xd8bf083f9, Xdd4f5c06a, Xe43d49958, Xe63290860, Xe698e2ff0, Xf6e8bbec8, Xfb67b357e]",X031b39290;X0b9edfac8;X10a71e5f0;X113280263;X127be1bea;X1400957eb;X163855b07;X180d01cf1;X1b63f81f1;X26f4e57ad;X289a6e913;X388224345;X3be9395bc;X3e6c685e0;X4095ceed5;X409a29c24;X425303e8b;X44606998c;X48ac4891d;X4e63c2f47;X4ec38c2fd;X51225899c;X53333991d;X5f80f8f5b;X650a079bc;X74e31ac5e;X75631bb15;X7717cfadc;X77b255fc9;X7950021ff;X7c5771a14;X83c3496a8;X8567efd8d;X874721b98;X8e52016c6;X8ebbff9db;X93a9d1a87;X93ac8e929;X97615da3a;X991cb40ea;X99693601d;X9c7ce4c63;X9fc819d26;Xa4d954210;Xa87b1f7fa;Xad7b387f0;Xb19d0d7ea;Xb3381e12c;Xb4b3d4707;Xb58801275;Xbbafc83f2;Xc11aba694;Xc4111f21c;Xc4442bf46;Xc6fa766f6;Xce307591a;Xd09d2c6d3;Xd1bde92fc;Xd40a29f99;Xd42e8aed5;Xd4c82ea6a;Xd6db25654;Xd85656f33;Xd8bf083f9;Xdd4f5c06a;Xe43d49958;Xe63290860;Xe698e2ff0;Xf6e8bbec8;Xfb67b357e,70,General Midpoint Subdivision,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3794,2012
473,"The Block Transform Coded, JPEG- a lossy image compression format has been used to keep storage and bandwidth requirements of digital image at practical levels. However, JPEG compression schemes may exhibit unwanted image artifacts to appear - such as the 'blocky' artifact found in smooth/monotone areas of an image, caused by the coarse quantization of DCT coefficients. A number of image filtering approaches have been analyzed in literature incorporating value-averaging filters in order to smooth out the discontinuities that appear across DCT block boundaries. Although some of these approaches are able to decrease the severity of these unwanted artifacts to some extent, other approaches have certain limitations that cause excessive blurring to high-contrast edges in the image. The image deblocking algorithm presented in this paper aims to filter the blocked boundaries. This is accomplished by employing smoothening, detection of blocked edges and then filtering the difference between the pixels containing the blocked edge. The deblocking algorithm presented has been successful in reducing blocky artifacts in an image and therefore increases the subjective as well as objective quality of the reconstructed image.","Sharma, Rohitt;Singh, Paramjit;Sharma, Sumit",International Journal of Applied Information Systems,"[X364860187, X4863dd162, X6160b5c3a, X68cb552d2, X6c105fcbb, X73f488dde, X7e2d2bffd, X81417eddc, X9f030c9b6, Xa337d0b1b, Xa895b1906, Xafd9c49c6, Xb2bfd549a, Xe3c46c7ee, Xf5fa95046]",X364860187;X4863dd162;X6160b5c3a;X68cb552d2;X6c105fcbb;X73f488dde;X7e2d2bffd;X81417eddc;X9f030c9b6;Xa337d0b1b;Xa895b1906;Xafd9c49c6;Xb2bfd549a;Xe3c46c7ee;Xf5fa95046,15,Deviation Causing Factors in a Code based on Environment of Analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1983,2012

Therefore, the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular diseases is directly affected by the blood-flow dynamics. Understanding flow behavior is of vital importance to understand the cardiovascular system and potentially harbors a considerable value for both diagnosis and risk assessment. The analysis of hemodynamic characteristics involves qualitative and quantitative inspection of the blood-flow field. Visualization plays an important role in the qualitative exploration, as well as the definition of relevant quantitative measures and its validation. There are two main approaches to obtain information about the blood flow: simulation by computational fluid dynamics, and in-vivo measurements. Although research on blood flow simulation has been performed for decades, many open problems remain concerning accuracy and patient-specific solutions. Possibilities for real measurement of blood flow have recently increased considerably by new developments in magnetic resonance imaging which enable the acquisition of 3D quantitative measurements of blood-flow velocity fields.

Using appropriate speech production data could significantly improve the quality of articulatory animation for AV synthesis.","Steiner, Ingmar;Richmond, Korin;Ouni, Slim",ArXiv e-prints,"[X691cbac21, Xc778af4a8, Xd3989086d]",X691cbac21;Xc778af4a8;Xd3989086d,3,Using multimodal speech production data to evaluate articulatory animation for audiovisual speech synthesis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4982,2012
478,"With systems for acquiring 3D surface data being evermore commonplace, it has become important to reliably extract specific shapes from the acquired data. In the presence of noise and occlusions, this can be done through the use of statistical shape models, which are learned from databases of clean examples of the shape in question. In this paper, we review, analyze and compare different statistical models: from those that analyze the variation in geometry globally to those that analyze the variation in geometry locally. We first review how different types of models have been used in the literature, then proceed to define the models and analyze them theoretically, in terms of both their statistical and computational aspects. We then perform extensive experimental comparison on the task of model fitting, and give intuition about which type of model is better for a few applications. Due to the wide availability of databases of high-quality data, we use the human face as the specific shape we wish to extract from corrupted data.","Brunton, Alan;Salazar, Augusto;Bolkart, Timo;Wuhrer, Stefanie",ArXiv e-prints,"[X002227665, X00fa7a190, X02eece0d8, X0334ff701, X040fce710, X0b559beb5, X13a5d66bf, X1efa3ddf7, X234487663, X249f7683e, X272842d09, X2bd414e0b, X2fc6edd3a, X371bafd3f, X376712ebc, X3962c1221, X3b5fcaa6c, X49acf06b4, X4ce718d76, X4ef9d2297, X54869ed3e, X54a4617f7, X573598f19, X58a546eee, X5a1363ff6, X5e1192257, X604bce283, X64410ba30, X6588090ac, X6ab8d94e2, X6cc99534e, X71c8e73cc, X72baa398a, X72c4b35c4, X76d4c4529, X78cddab98, X7a2ee39fc, X7f4011c2c, X8b0581d67, X8b62d3c6b, X8c881c351, X8f0c10dc8, X93c96572c, X96766f8fd, X9bd57348e, X9f7130c15, Xa623092ca, Xa768a482b, Xa839a9ea8, Xa9d8ee926, Xad491b311, Xaed5f7894, Xb4c99add3, Xb58c8c2a4, Xc1054d9f6, Xc99034e5a, Xcd96f74b6, Xceb69c0f0, Xd24eb81b3, Xd48e9e83d, Xd4e152384, Xe09905de8, Xe4879fb32, Xe676c2b33, Xe6c5caa94, Xed27ab134, Xee1757997, Xf327161a5, Xf50b0aa72, Xf697c1508, Xfa53f7843, Xfc3f98a8c]",X002227665;X00fa7a190;X02eece0d8;X0334ff701;X040fce710;X0b559beb5;X13a5d66bf;X1efa3ddf7;X234487663;X249f7683e;X272842d09;X2bd414e0b;X2fc6edd3a;X371bafd3f;X376712ebc;X3962c1221;X3b5fcaa6c;X49acf06b4;X4ce718d76;X4ef9d2297;X54869ed3e;X54a4617f7;X573598f19;X58a546eee;X5a1363ff6;X5e1192257;X604bce283;X64410ba30;X6588090ac;X6ab8d94e2;X6cc99534e;X71c8e73cc;X72baa398a;X72c4b35c4;X76d4c4529;X78cddab98;X7a2ee39fc;X7f4011c2c;X8b0581d67;X8b62d3c6b;X8c881c351;X8f0c10dc8;X93c96572c;X96766f8fd;X9bd57348e;X9f7130c15;Xa623092ca;Xa768a482b;Xa839a9ea8;Xa9d8ee926;Xad491b311;Xaed5f7894;Xb4c99add3;Xb58c8c2a4;Xc1054d9f6;Xc99034e5a;Xcd96f74b6;Xceb69c0f0;Xd24eb81b3;Xd48e9e83d;Xd4e152384;Xe09905de8;Xe4879fb32;Xe676c2b33;Xe6c5caa94;Xed27ab134;Xee1757997;Xf327161a5;Xf50b0aa72;Xf697c1508;Xfa53f7843;Xfc3f98a8c,72,Review of Statistical Shape Spaces for 3D Data with Comparative Analysis for Human Faces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6491,2012

Vector field topology is defined for steady vector fields and aims at discriminating the domain of a vector field into regions of qualitatively different behaviour. The presented approach represents a generalization for saddle-type critical points and their separatrices to unsteady vector fields based on generalized streak lines, with the classical vector field topology as its special case for steady vector fields. The concept is closely related to that of Lagrangian coherent structures obtained as ridges in the finite-time Lyapunov exponent field.

As the input to our algorithm, we are given only two sets of regions in two shapes; no descriptors are provided so the correspondence between the regions is not know, nor we know how many regions correspond in the two shapes. We show that even with such scarce information, it is possible to establish very accurate correspondence between the shapes by using methods from the field of sparse modeling, being this, the first non-trivial use of sparse models in shape correspondence. We formulate the problem of permuted sparse coding, in which we solve simultaneously for an unknown permutation ordering the regions on two shapes and for an unknown correspondence in functional representation. We also propose a robust variant capable of handling incomplete matches. Numerically, the problem is solved efficiently by alternating the solution of a linear assignment and a sparse coding problem. The proposed methods are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on standard benchmarks containing both synthetic and scanned objects.","Pokrass, J.;Bronstein, A. M.;Bronstein, M.

482,"A set of n points in low dimensions takes Theta(n w) bits to store on a w-bit machine. Surface reconstruction and mesh refinement impose a requirement on the distribution of the points they process. I show how to use this assumption to lossily compress a set of n input points into a representation that takes only O(n) bits, independent of the word size. The loss can keep inter-point distances to within 10% relative error while still achieving a factor of three space savings. The representation allows standard quadtree operations, along with computing the restricted Voronoi cell of a point, in time O(w^2 + log n), which can be improved to time O(log n) if w is in Theta(log n). Thus one can use this compressed representation to perform mesh refinement or surface reconstruction in O(n) bits with only a logarithmic slowdown.","Hudson, Benoît",ArXiv e-prints,"[X6701f791d, Xf5c9fb8b7]",X6701f791d;Xf5c9fb8b7,2,Succinct Representation of Well-Spaced Point Clouds,http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3137,2009

485,"In JPEG (DCT based) compresses image data by representing the original image with a small number of transform coefficients. It exploits the fact that for typical images a large amount of signal energy is concentrated in a small number of coefficients. The goal of DCT transform coding is to minimize the number of retained transform coefficients while keeping distortion at an acceptable level.In JPEG, it is done in 8X8 non overlapping blocks. It divides an image into blocks of equal size and processes each block independently. Block processing allows the coder to adapt to the local image statistics, exploit the correlation present among neighboring image pixels, and to reduce computational and storage requirements. One of the most degradation of the block transform coding is the blocking artifact. These artifacts appear as a regular pattern of visible block boundaries. This degradation is a direct result of the coarse quantization of the coefficients and the independent processing of the blocks which does not take into account the existing correlations among adjacent block pixels. In this paper attempt is being made to reduce the blocking artifact introduced by the Block DCT Transform in JPEG.","Singh, Sukhpal",ArXiv e-prints,"[X05aea5435, X0738ef3dd, X0a5e4680e, X0adccc220, X0b1caee63, X0c7251d2e, X0d56f2392, X0f40890b9, X107054ac2, X11130a992, X14328fd53, X1c996b10f, X1e21f9d6b, X1f8b90556, X1faf45522, X22c06294a, X24c156427, X28c9d35d2, X297b7e0ae, X2a261fd8c, X2b4749896, X33479a1ac, X34ded00cc, X42c59aec8, X461dad325, X463ccb6ec, X469b1eab6, X47254aa9d, X4df2e818b, X4f57a747e, X54aa0136a, X5834d9ea7, X59961cc7c, X5de8cd457, X5e6e30398, X683ec50e7, X6891685b5, X6af01913d, X730398857, X767c82398, X76df32931, X84fecb627, X85d3cac13, X8a9dd46b3, X8aa04af52, X8d276bb7c, X8ea893537, X8f8926053, X9d192978d, Xa895b1906, Xaa8edc044, Xaefa74fd7, Xbd51604bd, Xbf9cb94d2, Xcfbc84a8a, Xd23a1e5f3, Xd47a72ade, Xd4ad861ce, Xd624a2a75, Xd7788ac1d, Xd79c1acf0, Xdd151c2cb, Xe17f61197, Xe284d5e5f, Xe6e51fb36, Xeb0b3c1b0, Xebeb42a04, Xed1bce4bf, Xeee528bdc, Xf0873aacc, Xf3f13d68b, Xf85b3cb33, Xf94d3e2cc, Xfd90a5d39, Xfe246695f, Xff4104220, Xffdfdb927]",X05aea5435;X0738ef3dd;X0a5e4680e;X0adccc220;X0b1caee63;X0c7251d2e;X0d56f2392;X0f40890b9;X107054ac2;X11130a992;X14328fd53;X1c996b10f;X1e21f9d6b;X1f8b90556;X1faf45522;X22c06294a;X24c156427;X28c9d35d2;X297b7e0ae;X2a261fd8c;X2b4749896;X33479a1ac;X34ded00cc;X42c59aec8;X461dad325;X463ccb6ec;X469b1eab6;X47254aa9d;X4df2e818b;X4f57a747e;X54aa0136a;X5834d9ea7;X59961cc7c;X5de8cd457;X5e6e30398;X683ec50e7;X6891685b5;X6af01913d;X730398857;X767c82398;X76df32931;X84fecb627;X85d3cac13;X8a9dd46b3;X8aa04af52;X8d276bb7c;X8ea893537;X8f8926053;X9d192978d;Xa895b1906;Xaa8edc044;Xaefa74fd7;Xbd51604bd;Xbf9cb94d2;Xcfbc84a8a;Xd23a1e5f3;Xd47a72ade;Xd4ad861ce;Xd624a2a75;Xd7788ac1d;Xd79c1acf0;Xdd151c2cb;Xe17f61197;Xe284d5e5f;Xe6e51fb36;Xeb0b3c1b0;Xebeb42a04;Xed1bce4bf;Xeee528bdc;Xf0873aacc;Xf3f13d68b;Xf85b3cb33;Xf94d3e2cc;Xfd90a5d39;Xfe246695f;Xff4104220;Xffdfdb927,77,Reduction of Blocking Artifacts In JPEG Compressed Image,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1192,2012

487,"Surface parameterizations and registrations are important in computer graphics and imaging, where 1-1 correspondences between meshes are computed. In practice, surface maps are usually represented and stored as 3D coordinates each vertex is mapped to, which often requires lots of storage memory. This causes inconvenience in data transmission and data storage. To tackle this problem, we propose an effective algorithm for compressing surface homeomorphisms using Fourier approximation of the Beltrami representation. The Beltrami representation is a complex-valued function defined on triangular faces of the surface mesh with supreme norm strictly less than 1. Under suitable normalization, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of surface homeomorphisms and the set of Beltrami representations. Hence, every bijective surface map is associated with a unique Beltrami representation. Conversely, given a Beltrami representation, the corresponding bijective surface map can be exactly reconstructed using the Linear Beltrami Solver introduced in this paper. Using the Beltrami representation, the surface homeomorphism can be easily compressed by Fourier approximation, without distorting the bijectivity of the map. The storage memory can be effectively reduced, which is useful for many practical problems in computer graphics and imaging. In this paper, we proposed to apply the algorithm to texture map compression and video compression. With our proposed algorithm, the storage requirement for the texture properties of a textured surface can be significantly reduced. Our algorithm can further be applied to compressing motion vector fields for video compression, which effectively improve the compression ratio.","Lui, Lok Ming;Lam, Ka Chun;Wong, Tsz Wai;Gu, XianFeng",ArXiv e-prints,"[Xa33c21a4f, Xa794ae986, Xbbd207dfc, Xcfa658397]",Xa33c21a4f;Xa794ae986;Xbbd207dfc;Xcfa658397,4,Beltrami Representation and its applications to texture map and video compression,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8025,2012

Given two circular-arc polygons with $m$ and $n$ edges respectively, we prove that the proposed method runs in $O(m+n+(l+k)\log l)$ time, using $O(m+n+l+k)$ space, where $k$ is the number of intersections, and $l$ is the number of related edges.

In this technique all the characteristics of the palm such as principal lines, edges and wrinkles are considered with equal importance.","Misra, Rachita;ray, Kasturika B",ArXiv e-prints,"[X0de0dd569, X0eb749ab9, X1c927916a, X24ebd4483, X264dc5f90, X26ca9fa64, X31d39186a, X347a0315c, X361f02b44, X3d1d7d8ac, X3ee387382, X411e2c150, X430d9b72d, X439504756, X52977cb4e, X56bd26e7e, X6b5c785fd, X71f0e249d, X7266473c7, X7e2880e43, X8f83a0f0f, Xa4caf2115, Xada2d0328, Xc86fd99f7, Xcea6c5cf8, Xd96c11e4f, Xdc9a5a5d9, Xf82782dc8, Xfb0e07b54]",X0de0dd569;X0eb749ab9;X1c927916a;X24ebd4483;X264dc5f90;X26ca9fa64;X31d39186a;X347a0315c;X361f02b44;X3d1d7d8ac;X3ee387382;X411e2c150;X430d9b72d;X439504756;X52977cb4e;X56bd26e7e;X6b5c785fd;X71f0e249d;X7266473c7;X7e2880e43;X8f83a0f0f;Xa4caf2115;Xada2d0328;Xc86fd99f7;Xcea6c5cf8;Xd96c11e4f;Xdc9a5a5d9;Xf82782dc8;Xfb0e07b54,29,Textural Approach to Palmprint Identification,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6192,2012
490,"The JHU turbulence database [1] can be used with a state of the art visualisation tool [2] to generate high quality fluid dynamics videos. In this work we investigate the classical idea that smaller structures in turbulent flows, while engaged in their own internal dynamics, are advected by the larger structures. They are not advected undistorted, however. We see instead that the small scale structures are sheared and twisted by the larger scales. This illuminates the basic mechanisms of the turbulent cascade.","Bürger, Kai;Treib, Marc;Westermann, Rüdiger;Werner, Suzanne;Lalescu, Cristian C;Szalay, Alexander;Meneveau, Charles;Eyink, Gregory L",ArXiv e-prints,"[5134b7f110, X13d5cdf68, X172d930b1, X4c6b79e8a, X514f71ecd, X5167a03c9, X559e82b7e, X6b33614f3, X7b6d8c044, X83624bf97, Xa839a9ea8, Xd5c624b41, Xdce3722de, Xe22806e2f, Xe2651c851, Xeb1e1ec77]",5134b7f110;X13d5cdf68;X172d930b1;X4c6b79e8a;X514f71ecd;X5167a03c9;X559e82b7e;X6b33614f3;X7b6d8c044;X83624bf97;Xa839a9ea8;Xd5c624b41;Xdce3722de;Xe22806e2f;Xe2651c851;Xeb1e1ec77,16,Vortices within vortices: hierarchical nature of vortex tubes in turbulence,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3325,2012
491,"This paper presents the nearest neighbor value (NNV) algorithm for high resolution (H.R.) image interpolation. The difference between the proposed algorithm and conventional nearest neighbor algorithm is that the concept applied, to estimate the missing pixel value, is guided by the nearest value rather than the distance. In other words, the proposed concept selects one pixel, among four directly surrounding the empty location, whose value is almost equal to the value generated by the conventional bilinear interpolation algorithm. The proposed method demonstrated higher performances in terms of H.R. when compared to the conventional interpolation algorithms mentioned.","Olivier, Rukundo;Hanqiang, Cao",ArXiv
